ES2005a.A,"alright twenty five .  i've the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic .   but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . for  right . what do we think a what do we think a good size would be for this ? know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . right .   for emails ?

ES2005b.A," it's a inspired design .     noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , and was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? or if is that a function we want in the remote ? i don't , but i know a lot of people do right .  it just it has to be a certain whistle too , right ? that's costly though . much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping shouting , and then , what would the response be ? it beeps back at you  let me set this up . plug it in , press f_ five ? function f_ five ? or function f_ eight ?  it's just to lock it in . it's got it .   as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you guys , it's good you went first , and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and what novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . a lot of the buttons aren't used , and he mentioned that they're not fun to use . and novel feature which we just brought up was this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold it'll pick up as a distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say here i am of this sort . that's true . you could have a  tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes .  tha that's for later down the road and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , and not computery , right , more low tech and not too many buttons . took these all into consideration and also i have some limitations from the boss . right and practical limitations which i kinda threw out the window . and did a little research and unfortunately all i had to work on was our our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , which include , space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains or or a high speed train . right and having personally worked with all these products have a great deal of experience with with industrial design of these . right . i figured , just put 'em all together . you got a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t_v_ , and as for the user interface problem , too many buttons . give it one button and it's a for the cowboy in all of us i'm not quite what the function is there but it's a g you could have a right .

ES2005b.A,"missed the budget thing , it was fifty million euros ? and we gotta sell twenty five of them ? right . mixed those numbers .  guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic that should be just like tenth of the price or less . an energy source which'd probably just be your regular batteries we don't wanna have it  we could do that too . i hadn't thought of that .  right . right ,  the unirs the user interface the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product . and lastly the transmission interface is just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . here's a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me . as you can see the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . and i suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't they were personal preferences , programmable options which just require a small amount of memory , non volatile memory , just the user can put in their favourite channels and their preferred volume settings that when they turn it on it's not blasting .  and the the bells and whistles that we mentioned they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and whistles .  that's all i got .  that's tight . i don't think we need to screw it in . just push it . yellow .    it's they're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . you could programme it with your channels and then you say like b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel .  it didn't work very though because of this noise interference problem . they mentioned if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one . right , right , and there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the t_v_ and then all of a sudden it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or or turn the volume off but if you can work around that noise problem   right . right and then it would do just subtractive cancellation of the noise . what you could do then would be you have remote controlled by the t_v_ speaker , or not a remo i'm a microphone by the t_v_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , you can't expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into their t_v_s .

ES2008d.B,"there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things you won't lose them .  we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever there's only one t_v_ and there's only like three chairs .   or like what the setup of the house is too . but , am notorious for losing my keys ,  i've just never lost the remote . i put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them . was putting groceries away . you're taking from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room . can't get in , look all around the kitchen . definitely in the vegetable drawer .   but it's we don't carry remotes around that much .  with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , i am located  a g_p_s_ system , internal g_p_s_ . although if it's sitting still for too long . yes i  or little or just a wheel , just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll .  zoom  all kinds of possibilities .    you've had like the most typing and organising to do .  how much of your powerpoint was already done for you , every meeting .    i didn't even think about adding slides , would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more .  right . no , definitely not . we no , i don't think we need to the r_ and r_ , especially if the yellow and black one . or yellow and blue . lemme go to the web page . finish meeting now .     it i it grey , isn't it ? yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue .   we don't have the right colour clay anyway .  we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , potato mango shaped remotes .  i can't believe a whole day is gone . i don't feel like it's been that long . get sucked in . haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet .

ES2008d.C,"right , do you wanna start ?   what we call that one the rhombus , the rhombus . this one is known as the potato , it's it's a how can i present it ? it's an ergonomic shape , it fits in your hand nicely . it's designed to be used either in your left hand or in your right hand . i've gone here just for four buttons on this one . the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . the red ones are for changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . this middle button here brings up the on screen menu and when you're working in the on screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button to select and that's it , that's the potato . that would be one of your channels , like channel zero would be t to switch the machine off ,  not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t_v_ off . that'd be one way of doing it , that'd work , let's pass . that's that's our three prototypes .  in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or a logo on it or whatever . would  but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy .  it would be difficult technologically , because if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s it's i'm not quite how it would work and then i wonder if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . mean ho how many times do you really , lose your remote control and would a device like that actually help you to find it ? it's possible , put an extra the button on .   it makes look more fruity as it's like a deformed foot ,       this is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . you find the choice that you want and you press you press the right button they're used for going into and out of your submenus , potato . i'll go for two . it's functional , it's also pretty basic , i'll give it a two . i'd say it's technologically it's not unique , it's just it is just pushbuttons ","we call that one the rhombus , this one is known as the potato , it's an ergonomic shape , i've gone here just for four buttons on this one . the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . this middle button here brings up the on screen menu it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t_v_ off . in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons it would be difficult technologically , and then i wonder if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . it makes look more fruity as the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . potato . ",The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most.

They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. The team was generally quite satisfied.

IS1004b.B,"there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .  it doe it's all the functions are controlled through the l_c_d_ screen except for the really main functions , which have a couple of their own buttons . and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out on the market , i know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have have these l_c_d_ screens which helps when you're using multiple devices i suppose because you can have multiple functions d different functions on the screen at different times . but the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control , and it's difficult to to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is like mouse scroll wheel , which is it's a really important design aspect is it's what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . and the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the channel . now the that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of changing the channel . know when i when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the pad . i usually use the up and down because most channels are two digit numbers and you have to press special button to enter a two digit number , and then two numbers , that's just it's annoying . think a scroll wheel is quite handy . now the scroll wheel is much more useful if you have an l_c_d_ screen , and this brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability . one possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because lot of this can't be done for twenty five eu euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the l_c_d_ screen that instead of actually saying i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programme's on , often you don't ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . if you have a list of programs on your l_c_d_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . if you think about it's like a in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . this would be pretty handy thing to have , but we really need t to discuss the price . there are there are cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context .

IS1004b.B,"this is something else we might wanna consider , is really limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating universal remote control on epinions . it's really worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as possible because really people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . and was saying before about having different size buttons for different frequently used tasks , but also the location and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . if you have too many buttons it increases the difficulty of finding the one you want .  we w  we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we're only doing television remote control . think one option is to have little flip open door that that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons i would if i had my perfect remote control , i'd probably just have no numbers on it because they're just in the way . they don't really do anything .  although i do also find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever , but door that you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . but definitely you need to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not let that interfere with the functionality of the device .  guess that depends on how you market it . if you if you have the right advertisement showing how easy it is and how you can , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . but  one of the really useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . if we can have a higher priced remote control that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing . there's the l_c_d_ screen , which is too expensive , but also at the scroll wheel , i haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an l_c_d_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . even that , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an l_c_d_ screen , to implement , but that would be quite useful as and the other thing , you say we need to keep it just television , but one one option , since this is supposed to be a fashionable device , is there's a certain or factor that you can you can have with technology , and we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . say you have like little another little base unit that can also receive signals as as the television where you can , say change the lighting in the room .

He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. Then they move on to the three presentations. They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. Next, the user interface specialist presents. He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. "

After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV.

IS1004c.C,"afternoon .  we had falafel .     spongy means it's like sp   but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ?   means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits apple , banana , something like that .    that we can discuss afterwards . banana .  i don't th it will be rolling a lot . but it's just a speaker right ? it's not a microphone .  actually i'm not reading microphone there , that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you .       in house .      let's go ahead . stable thing , to have ,      communicate . it's one way .     it's a speech synthesis thing , something has been stored and it's just spoken out .    this is going to be about the component design . first thing is we need power source for the remote control . was of the idea that we can have two power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used it'll be pretty innovative kind . then we need plastic with some elasticity that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t  there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if i'm right . it's symmetrical thing , whatever it is . it could be curve , it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what we want . there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . these are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve . there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's wooden cases    is it an e apple which has banana is more handier as compared to this and to capsicum . push buttons for the traditional users that they don't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we can go ahead with that . ","this is going to be about the component design . first thing is we need power source for the remote control . was of the idea that we can have two power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used it'll be pretty innovative kind . then we need plastic with some elasticity that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , and then it should be double curve . the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve . but plastic is is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down push buttons for the traditional users that they don't feel they are alienated , ","Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control. He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. "
