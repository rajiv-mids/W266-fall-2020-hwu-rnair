ES2002a.A,"hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . got the project announcement about what the project is . designing a remote control . that's about it , didn't get anything else . did you get the same thing ?    there's too much gear .   can't draw .   anyway , i don't know , it's just the first animal think off the top of my head . yes . big reason is i'm allergic to most animals . allergic to animal fur , fish was a natural choice .  and i like whales . they come in and go eat everything in sight . and they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . tail's a bit big ,    it's an after dinner dog then .   it does make sense from the design point of view you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . possibly .   and you keep losing them . finding them is really a pain , it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table .    one factor would be production cost . because there's a cap there , depends on how much you can cram into that price . that's the main factor .  ","and i like whales . they come in and go eat everything in sight . you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . one factor would be production cost .

The team then discussed various features to consider in making the remote. 
ES2002a.B," right this is the kick off meeting for our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ?  great .  we're designing a new remote control and have to record who's here actually . that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ? and you all arrived on time . des design a new remote control . as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . that's our brief , as it were . and there are three different stages to the design . i'm not really what you guys have already received in your emails . what did you get ?  is that what everybody got ?   we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there .  you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . who would like to go first ? very good .    right . lovely .  right . you can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .  we do we do don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . ach why not we might have to get you up again then . i don't mine is . i'm gonna have to think on the spot now .  is that a whale ?   god , i still don't i'm gonna write about .  i was gonna choose a dog as but i'll just draw a different dog . m my favourite animal is my own dog at home .  that doesn't really look like him , actually . he looks more like a pig , actually .  do you ? that's very good of you .   he's a mixture of various things . and what do i like about him , that's just to suggest that his tail wags . he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very affectionate and  and he's quite wee as he can doesn't take up too much space .  and and he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as which is quite amusing , it is . it is . he only does it after he's had his dinner and he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .      right , where did you find this ? just down here ?  what are we doing next ? we now need to discuss the project finance . according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . ","this is the kick off meeting for our project . we're designing a new remote control and as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . and there are three different stages to the design . we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . m my favourite animal is my own dog at home . he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , ",The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal. The project manager talked about the project finances and selling prices. 
ES2002a.B,"we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , fifty percent of the selling price .  all together . dunno . i imagine that's a good question . i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but i don't know , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it think it will ?    regions and    for a remote control , do you think that will be i suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .   what , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? like how much money people have to spend on things like ? aye , i see what marketing . good marketing thoughts . gosh , i should be writing all this down .    like how much does , a remote control cost . twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds isn't it ? or no , is it as much as that ? sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .  i've never bought a remote control , don't know how good a remote control that would get you . but i suppose it has to look and gimmicky . right , let me just scoot on ahead here .  does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue thin no , actually . that would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .    five minutes to end of meeting .  we're a bit behind .  right , do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d do your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ?   or even like , notes about what you wanna watch . like you might put in there want to watch such and look a that's a good idea . extra functionalities .    i'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . i'll just check we've nothing else  anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one you keep losing them .   w you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . there is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? dunno .   my goodness . still feels quite primitive . like a touch screen   guess that's up to our industrial designer . it looks better .    right , just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . ","and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , fifty percent of the selling price . i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it like how much does , a remote control cost . twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds don't know how good a remote control that would get you . but i suppose it has to look and gimmicky . right , do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d do your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? extra functionalities . you keep losing them . w you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . like a touch screen ",The project manager talked about the project finances and selling prices. The team then discussed various features to consider in making the remote. 
ES2002a.B,"inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , what requirements it has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you ,  it's th the functional design stage is next ,  and and that's the end of the meeting . got that little message a lot sooner than would ,   th  just very quickly this we're supposed to finish now . guess that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it ,      right , we'll that's the end of the meeting , then .  all for coming .

ES2002a.D," great . and i'm andrew and i'm our marketing expert .  that's it .  i will go . that's fine . alright .  this one here , right ? very alright . my favourite animal is like   a beagle .  charac favourite characteristics of it ? is that right ? right , high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . and , that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health . this is blue . blue beagle . my family's beagle .   i coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . boy , let me tell you . impressionist .  alright .  superb sketch ,   i see a dog in there .   now i see a rooster . what kind is it ?   is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?   probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .   can we just go over that again ? bas at twel alright , cost like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is that wholesale or retail ? like on the shelf . our sale anyway .    alright . yes .   right away i'm wondering if there's th like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . frequencies as as characters , different keypad styles and s symbols .  i don't know .    and then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . i'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , just a chara just a characteristic of the just or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london , might not be such a big hit in greece , who knows , something like that ,   right away i'm making some assumptions about what information we're given here , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . i'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five euros , is that the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or     i'd say  no .    do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other   interesting thing about discussing production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes it just comes along . do what like like how do you one way of looking at it would be , the people producing television sets , they have to buy remote controls .

ES2002a.D,"or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one but right . right .  right , in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses    like what we could use is a like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm pilots . they're gone from being just like little scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda . wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or   an  like , p personally for me , at home i've combined the the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . they w all work actually function together but i have different remote controls for each of them . it's ironic that then they're in there  the sound and everything it's just one system . but each one's got its own little part .      that's just really good id    i remember when the first remote control my family had was on a cable . actually had a cable between it and the t_v_ and big like buttons that like , like on a blender and when about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still like a massive junky thing on the table . we could think about how , could be more , streamlined . s something like that , or whatever would be technologically reasonable . it could b it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of not having these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway .     before we wrap up , just to make we're all on the same page here , do we we were given an example of a coffee machine right ?   are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? or are we keeping like a design commitment to television features ? i don't know .        alright .

ES2002b.A,"do you mind passing me my notepad .    this is just the working design this is just what how i would go about it . guess i try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . think in a practical way , we it is . we've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , back in the back of our minds we the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? and the idea is just to get everybody to i usually have a design that's there as a basic , things that to start everything going . but everybody does have some idea , don't think there's a need for that . this finding things is a little bit confusing , i'll go into the diagram first . it just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need in the diagram and in this slide probably works better .  you need some power source . a battery to keep it going . and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last . it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . like voice recognition , right . that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , that's one perhaps constraint there .  th the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . and that picks up an input from a user , logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r based on you push button a_ , will do something with button a_ . button a_ is the power button , and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . and that's about it in terms of my design it's fairly general , and the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking , like voice recognition , right ,  if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . it's not really a constraint in that sense , ","this is just the working design guess i try to define like what we're doing now , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like back in the back of our minds we the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . i'll go into the diagram first . it just explains how the process goes through , from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need you need some power source . a battery to keep it going . and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last . like voice recognition , right . that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , that's one perhaps constraint there . th the basic thing is there's a user interface and that picks up an input from a user , a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself like voice recognition , right , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power .

ES2002b.A,"but these are functionally , the base , what the technology has to do . guess the rest of it we should you wanna go back to what the functions are ? that's more relevant to a discussion ? w i'm done . more or less .  ps it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , like that .  this would be  these aren't technology options in that sense . this is just a basic principles and basic components that are needed . if you needed if you needed to add voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the v_r_ and like that .   each component represents one function , but the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . there might be one other consideration which would be that the transmission between the remote control and the t_v_ are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra red thing ? because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . right .  there might be one other problem with the transmission , in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . i it you may not require that , but it's it's something very natural , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button to start s talking about it . then you need to send the signal out , because if you're using infra red , the line of sight say the t_v_'s at that chair , and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . in that sense , there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . not much further down . there's not much specific information , but that one indication of infra red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . because infra red is something which everybody has .  there's a there's from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . you need a docking cradle , for you to put it in to charge . or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .

ES2002b.A,"but unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then i don't think rechargeable is something we should we really need to care about .      another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? could suggest we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , but from a point of view of a person using the device , t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non basic . it might help with the visualisation . and it would actually help with the component build as no , not really .  things like on off . because they don't have anything to do with what you see . i me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value ,  and channel . because the on off also goes , like on off like power , not on off sound . not on off video . although you don't turn off the video on your t_v_ , but you might wanna turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , you have a choice of putting it on to others or a device . device is anything which we can't categorise , right . we put it out .  anything to do with what you hear , right . you put that into audio . and then video is anything that you can see .     like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . it's easy to use , that's one thing that and from the component point of view it's easy to build as things are like fixed . ","then i don't think rechargeable is something we should we really need to care about . another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? could suggest we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non basic . device is anything which we can't categorise , right . and then video is anything that you can see .

ES2016c.A,"i suppose that you can have this . a banana shape ?  possibly like a  just to butt in for a second . possibly like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? you have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy feel to it . you can various covers . we could leave that to the cover department .  we all know they've got nothing to do all day .   notice the giant dog bone shape ? also good for animals .  what's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?    works in arizona but in edinburgh not no batteries are probably the way to go .  the ru the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? or the rubbery we cannot ?     is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? what about a smell ? t to the remote ? yellow and grey . grapefruit . i would say , if i were to make a decision , i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower end of the spectrum of importance .   perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit minded remote buyer . it's yellow . it's curved . it's couple of grey stripes . we could put the grey stripes on the bottom that person could turn it over . it would look like a banana just sitting on their table . rather than rather th the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . we could have a variety of options here .  do you have more to your presentation ?   i'm gonna plug in here real quick . if i could . like i said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here .  ow . ow .   these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , the chip on print , and the case . probably case material . and probably a shape also . and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what the type is . and what supplements we'll have .  energy source we've , we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . and we have five minutes .   guess we should pick the case then . if we go with the plasticky case , or the plastic case , then the chip on print is still we could have either or . we could have a complex one or a non complex . but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?   we would , we would have the l_c_d_ screen ?

ES2016c.B,"    alright .     that's industrial design for cranes , like that . makes sense , makes sense .   let's see . i'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the in there . i've more information on possible materials as what we can and cannot do . but let's just for this to load up and i'll show you what we're talking about here .  the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . the underside , that's pretty cheap piece of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of further transistors and like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it's getting and will do what you tell it . much for the workings of the remote control itself . its job is to for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television . when you press a key you complete a specific connection . the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . right . pretty clear . transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . this is the circuit board from the other side . the lower part of it , i don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is what we saw in the first slide just flipped over . you can see the circuit board itself . that's the cheapest way to make electronic connections on the market . what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these lines on the board . these are the actual keys that are being pressed . they close the electric circuit . that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . that would be behind here . which sends it over to the transistors and all that that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . now as you can see this is the rubber button version of it . ","the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , its job is to for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television .

ES2016c.B,"the way it works is that you have the keys here . the rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . and thus gives on the signal . now this is the simple version . we are talking this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . we are talking something more complicated it's going to be more expensive as and not only that . we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . i've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as rubber that is used in these anti stress balls . it's pretty squishy . that would serve that purpose . we could also use wood , or titanium . fya i don't have an information on that . however our company can provide us with with the titanium , assume , i'm , i was given an to use it . it certainly is an expensive material , i'm aware of that , but i was given an but there are certain restrictions to certain materials . now let's first go through the list with the materials . we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . can also mix these . as for the energy source , we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . what we could use is , or what i was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . right ? dynamo . interestingly enough . we could use solar cells . or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . such as like watches where you just move them m move the actual device and this pr provides it with some energy . personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? solar cell is interesting . may fail though , every here and there .  or you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and always the you but exactly . the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem . you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it starts to work . i'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery . which also makes a base station obsolete . we don't need that then .  however our interface options are push buttons . in which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert .  however we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . and they are possible . we have an for scroll wheels .

ES2016c.B,"however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d_ into the remote control as this however may exclude certain materials . if you have a squishy remote control , then an l_c_d_ screen may be affected by the movement . hence we might not be able to put it in there .  there's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . if we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set up that we that i've just presented , the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as i don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but it will be a significant difference . i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . that's for the scroll wheel . it limits our choice and squishy is hip , i'd say rather not go for that . let's see now .  solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control . but that's not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells , i assume right ? or is anybody still alright . alright . which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume .   with the titanium we cannot make it a curved design . we would just be able to make it flat and and a straight design which i assume would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions .  you can have an l_c_d_ screen . but therefore no rubber will be used . alright ? plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will influence the form . with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . latex is tricky . or rubber and and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an l_c_d_ screen , and then you can choose either plastic or titanium . or wood even . if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . add an l_c_d_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . or make it just push buttons . plastic gives you the b biggest variety of options . not the nicest feel . or not much originality really . with rubber we could sh shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an l_c_d_ screen . that's the tricky thing . s certainly can be done yes .  if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . like say just the underside or then it can be done . i assume .   the fruit design ","however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d_ into the remote control as if we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set up that we that i've just presented , the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control . with the titanium we cannot make it a curved design . with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . with rubber we could sh shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an l_c_d_ screen .

IB4003.A,"      hi everyone . for coming to this meeting . as you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is the fact that we're moving and we are going to get more space . that's a very good piece of news . but we also have to find out how we use this space . if you want , i'll just give a brief overview of what's happening and then we can talk about , arranging these new the new office space . in case you haven't seen the documents let me just show you very briefly the configuration of the space . there is nothing much to say . how many of us are present and that we are bit tight actually in our present location . that's why actually the university finally allocated us this this part of the unimail building . it's at the sixth floor . and it's contiguous rooms as you can all see from from here . the one p_ , two p_ , three p_ means the number of persons . as you can see we have several corridor with a number of of rooms , of one person rooms , two person room and three person rooms . actually agnes did this drawing she even put the view , we have the old town on one side , and the mountains on the other two sides . we have some bathrooms for us . and a courtyard which actually means a shaft , because the court is down at the first floor . it's a bit difficult to say , because we have some constraints in terms of furniture . they are here . your person your question actually is answered by the third item . each person should get it's a desk , it's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner . with , a chair . filing cabinet that goes under the desk and , we can put hanging shelves over the desks . i'm not really it's possible to get three three desks in a two person office . but we could try . what's what should be said here , i don't know if , you i will distribute now documents if you don't have them . it's easier . do you need something , martin ? keep this for you . it's  you have a copy , susan . you too david , there are more places than people , we won't be that constrained . as some of us and some of you here actually , martin and david are part time . it's for the moment quite comfortable . normally we should even get an extra an extra place for , temporary people coming to work on on projects .  i counted we have fifteen pers physical persons and about sixteen , persons actually , eighteen persons in the offices . exactly , ",,
IB4003.A,"it one of the issues here , it's probably not on the slides , is that we would like to have unlike what had until now , a lounge or reading room in one of the offices . in one of the rooms . quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that . if we could do it , then it would be much nicer . let me also st say something    sixteen slots for fifteen people . it's still should be feasible . that's  that's quite important to manage some space . we can think of , some two or three , for visiting people . correct .  let me finish with the constraints which are almost done . we also need to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer . the fax , is very small , but the photocopier is quite huge , and the printer is ab this size .  the offices comes with white boards . not very very important . the furniture that w each person has and you have a list of people . the thing you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w we're thin that are thinking about for about putting people i in these rooms . there is another group that is also having discussions . the idea is that today we'll just try to f start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to go and think about it ask the people your assistants , and at the next meeting we'll try to come with one solution . the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation . if i if we don't get these ? they are promised to us do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or it's  that's one of the problems . we should take this into account and think of some of the bigger rooms with four people , one being temporary or part time . we could try to see now what would be the main options . say the general arrangement options . do you think that we should put people , say , according to projects in the table that that we have , we also have the the p the main projects on which the people are working . how  actually what is fixed is the n the number of rooms . this we cannot really change . at least not us , it would be much more difficult to get another room but what is not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms . we are all the permutations are possible at the moment .  what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy . the other group is , don't think we have to see them as competitors , ",,
IB4003.A,"but they are just trying to find another local optimum . or l  we that's there is no real competition between the two , but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how close they are , actually . it's the m the people who decided this thought it was the best solution to , find two kinds of opinions . we could have been eight h sitting around here and talking , but it's more difficult .   exactly ,  today the goal is not to find the solution today , but to set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences . we won't be able to accommodate all the preferences , but at least we'll find the most the most important ones . p s   that's one of the things we know that they have students , we don't know exactly if they prefer to be alone , or to to be with their assistant , or even with another person working on the project . that would have been another solution is to ask everyone to provide an arrangement , but think that's a bit bit hard then to work out . since all of you have a copy of the of the drawing , for the next time , m you could come with a concrete proposal with names on it . but let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people , say , by projects or just professor and assistant . what would be f , say , first your preferences , since let's start with us , today . what do you think about it ? would you prefer to be alone , would you prefer to be with your assistant . you who are part time , do you think you can come here on a very w regular schedule or is it part time , but variable during the week ?  and since you're coming on the half time , do you think you will be able to group your presence here , say monday , tuesday and wednesday morning , or is it going to be m much more random ?  too . martin , you are also half time and , the third person is gisella . it's quite clear that each person should have their own desk and  it's no way we could put two persons at the same desk .  grouping   are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people ?       like cubicles .  i will try to find out whether we can separate . for the moment the answer at least is no , because it's not only , making a wall , but also b making a new door . it's quite a lot of of work , but will try to find this out for the next time . at least for the moment , as you can see there are can show them here on the screen . ",,
IB4003.A,"there are these two rooms on the left that accommodate one person . at least some of the professors , since you are four , could go could take these these rooms . and quite a lot of rooms with two persons . how do you feel susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the most involved in the teaching ?      that's that's true .  we could s look a bit at the projects . do you think it's a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project , since they talk quite a lot of to each other ?   and some of the p_h_d_ students will hopefully finish their p_h_d_ at some point .        actually , the lounge could serve as some meeting room , but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in the building , as we now know .   think we need a  and also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge , which is a whole other topic .    for the moment actually only one slot would be fully free . that is  that means one visitor at a time . or one intern . that's   it's already in progress . and you're working think , w one of the things i have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and  it's quite a heavy transformation of the building .   and i'll try to find out . and the other question is , can we squeeze four people in the or at least four places in the three p_ room ?  hopefully visitors don't need as much say filing space , or they don't have that many papers .  that's have to ask , you don't really feel very strongly attached to this grouping by projects idea ?  exactly .   they can change .    that's going to be one of the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in not staying . are you aware f of any strong constraints right now ?  that's true . smoking is now no longer a constraint .   that's the new regulation . on the balcony , actually .  normally .   o on the toilets or    yes , martin said also for him and , especially for her . the in she's the interface .       putting gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option , because we weren't offered it would be but i'll try to find out , but i th  we'll try , but all these , are say difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and , people just don't wanna change in general . let's see , we can find some temporary at least a proposal for gisella .

IB4003.C,"and if you look now at their the current division of the offices , bruno and agnes are sharing an office and they're working on different projects and they're just fine with that . there were , but they disappeared as of october when the no smoking rule came in , because before we were grouping the smokers and now that there's no smoking , guess that's not very important option , though except for that you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony , no . no , n it's in principle it's a no smoking building . you can smoke outside . you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke . not even in the cafeteria . no . full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students . there is the there's that terrace .  no . the other way . no , we do have one constraint that's difficult , which is gisella , because when she's there she's very noisy . she's on the phone a lot it's just it's by  it's by nat by the nature of her work that lot of it is communication .  that's a excellent idea . why don't we ask about that ? there is certainly enough space down the hall , wi if all of those offices that are , where half of them are also half time , and they're very under used . and pierrette too .   with younger people , no . we invite and then we say , you can sit with gisella . except for in every other faculty .  yes , it is every other faculty as far as i have seen their offices and the people that i know and that's in in law , socio economics , it's a they all have their own office . in the law faculty they're at best there half time . we're gonna have to .  i'll ask maggie and pierrette if they have any preferences .  no . since they're not at the meeting it's in out of courtesy we should first ask them . he means reading room . no . coffee machines . no , there's the cafeteria is downstairs , but they close at five .  but there's the two machines , and they're the vending machines where you just put the money and you can get    tuesday we have the don't forget we have the other meeting the m_d_m_ meeting in the morning , it would have to be in the afternoon . exactly .  at nine thirty , but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon . nah ?

IB4003.D,"      andre , just , just a clarification question , are they number of people per room indicated strict , or can we play around with ? if there are two people , is it really that you can't put three or two and a half or how was it calculated ?   i have everything .  are you of that ?   but counting the rea the reading room .  and susan , don't forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room , you should be able to valorize this if possible . but i still agree with you that the b the we are not large , as far as space is concerned . because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions , to the best if you take two people room for the reading room , then you have sixteen places . that also means that the growth will be zero . visiting visiti visiting researchers , students coming for exchange students et cetera . we j we stay where we are . no the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space . andre , for interrupting , but one again clarification question , what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions , because at least we are half per cent fifty per cent of from e_p_f_l_ and sometimes you have meetings where w y the decision is already taken , you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things , what will be the impact of what we will come out come up with ? another way of a another way of asking the question , is there any other group already working on on the how this should be should be allocated ? or are we the one that is supposed to do the p position for it ? but wha why don't they have any representative here .  why do we do it separately ?   no , but that's a standard thing . it's suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that , we'll put them put her or him somewhere else , then we will do plenty of work for nothing , because we'll not have this constraint . we'll not be aware of this constraint .     i agree with that . that's whe where part time is important is that it's n an overlo load on a room , for if you have a part time person , it reduces the ranges of time where too many people in the room . as far as i am concerned i probably might be able to have a regular presence here . the the thing that f in my case has to be taken into account is that i will have a lot of phone calls . i'll be talking o over the phone all the time . that's not necessary it depends on ",,
IB4003.D,"i have nothing against sharing a an office with somebody . i d already did it before , and it was perfectly fine . it just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the room , which is very d much dependent on people . some people are not disturb by this . some people just can't work . i'm not . but and what might happen , but it it will not be heavy here at issco is visitors . that i will have more at e_p_f_l_ , typically students coming in or asking for things . as i'm not teaching here , i'm teaching at e_p_f_l_ , this should shouldn't be a such a big load . for me it will be essentially i will not be able to be silent in the room , because i will be communicating also through vocal means ,    do you go for boxes in the bigger rooms where , like cubicles ? you really want to have walls .   four walls .     i fully agree with that . that's it's much easier to me to to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room , than sharing with their students .  because but that's it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons , as you said . you are discussing a budget on the project , you over the phone typically you don't necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion , no . no , because pro project doesn't last in time . they will change . that's what the only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people .  they will promote that . but still , th some things  if it if i if projects are what you have in mind , that meeting room is the tool for that . if you need to have people in a projects talking together , they just have a meeting room if it's not too far away then it's a very good practice . yes . that's why i was quite receptive to susan's remark at the beginning is i wouldn't formulate it in a such a an extreme way as , do we really need the lounge ? but would p probably formulate it in the way that do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room ? because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do collaborative work . but on the other hand we also have to relax , that's yes . yes .   that's really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's it pr provides no possible possibilities of expansion . and this will happen . you can't prevent having visitors . and you shouldn't . which for fifteen people it's not enough .  it's ",,
IB4003.D,"we have four professors here and two researchers .  it's bad it's bad . because this is really related with security regulation as you can't just put walls in rooms without any specific authoris it's not necessary heavy in terms of work . it's heavy in terms of administrative authorisation . at least at e_p_f_l_ .  if you organise the desks in a intelligent way . right , that's the point . no .  coffee machines are that made for that . no , that's proximity doesn't play a big role there . we can discuss with people that the space is very small , altogether it's and you don't y you don't need to discuss about the projects , you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer , how do i get furniture , i'm i don't have a pencil , where is the box with the pencils , and on . this is not project related .  that's true . no . it's non smoking campus . not even in the cafeteria ? downstairs ?   on the roof the balcony , but andre , just a still some places where smokers can survive . but andre , just a comment abou about your previous request . i don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom . that's a typical output of ex research in expert systems . these are the rules that you never get . but you can get them through a proposal . you propose a set up , where people are with other peoples and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that they don't want to have a view on the mountains , but they prefer to have view on the old town , they would be in the toilets . they would prefer to be in another room .   but that's a sec s that's the admin it's part of the work . and that's a problem , you're right , because we don't have a one person we d we don't have enough one person rooms for accommodating the the admin place . and if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space , who else would you put in there ? because we don't have any assistant manager or we don't have we have only one half part half time admin and no other non researcher positions , if i'm not mistaken . and this is really a piece of a problem . you could put some visitors , but know . it's not very realistic in a in an admin room , but because you can't put a researcher there . that's just either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager .   no that's not the there are to me there are two options possible is either you we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin , ",,
IB4003.D,"because some of , typically , the professors have good reasons for sharing . sharing either with a colleague or sharing with some of their one of their p_h_d_ students . in that case it's realistic . then we could very simply allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin . and that would solve the problem . the other thing is to take a two person room for the admin . that could be the one close to the here in the centre the  but tha no , the other one , the one op here , this one . but then that the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open . would be more of the opinion to see whether it's evident that , let's say the at least the two full time professors that are here on the list , we have one here , but maggie is not present . if they really and pierrette . if because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room , which might or might not be the case . it's certainly not something that we should impose , but we can ask . but that's not realistic either . you have a fore foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put him in the admin office ? you'll not do that . you can do that with an exchange student , that's but you can't take a senior visitor and him in the secretary . you're here . as susan said , p  is that    no , that's it . as we said , it's really a matter of personal preference , it cannot be something else . it cannot be imposed for it's job . again andre , that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves . tell you according to what i know now where i would like or would be ready to be , but i really don't see how i could decide for maggie or pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there . b why couldn't we do like couldn't we do it like for the set up of meetings . you everyone received that and should provide i would like to be here . and then you will have this multi constraint problem and you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution .  i would ask for their place . that's that's the important thing you want to know . it's a reading room . reading room , it's not a cafeteria . but that's an open question whether it's a it's a it at the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing , reading the newspapers , et cetera . there has been a very long discussion about that . ",,
IB4003.D,"i stinct this discussion is still vivid , that some of the people , i bel belong to these people , would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for but also meeting room if necessary . or , as susan said , a room an emergency room where you can put some visitors in a decent environment for work , because you don't have any other place to do it . but that's really an open discussion and that d no decision , no final decision has been taken about that . yes . yes . the one that i don't want to have in the next room ?   that would be great . that would be great . c that is one of the main not main but one of the important features that we need to know about . yes . yes . we don't have cafeteria . no , there is no coffee in the reading room . that was the wrong we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines , five . and you can bring your coffee in the reading room . t to try the coffee ? wai next tuesday . not easy ,  next tuesday we have a meeting , that might be where is the meeting ? it's unimail ? then it could be that that that would be great , because that would allow us not to move , or not to travel twice . after lunch . right .

IS1001b.A,"because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on t_v_ more where it seems that the market is more important . it's a good decision .  what's your opinion ?    you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do i don't know .     are you u_c_ is the central unit ?  computation .   this is quite easy . there is not that much constraints . to have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ? standard button one . do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?   it's a bit long one month for the standard one with button . even if we have a l_c_d_ display ?   we can take this into account . who think it would be good to go for like speech recognition ? it will . euros .  each unit is sell twenty five euros . because we are it seems that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .  we can we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . will continue . ask your question if you want .  it's not intuitive first .  but , but also it seems that    it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product .  but also we see that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . we may just make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and also some lightning too because most people find also hard to find the remote control . losed lose it etcetera . these are these two points are the main frustrations if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost it will add serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . but le let us see first the new requirement . we don't have to this is in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and like that but then you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and    anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's not used any more by users , they prefer to s   if i one button is still one more button . if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . anyway i have this point . we can discuss . also as i told before it would be better if it's only for the t_v_ because we want to be quick on the market .

IS1002c.B,"that's just a that's just something he a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . what's special and unique about a scroll ? right the two big th points that we have far are the having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell with a plastic interior , having it look really and also be really durable . right . let's get a product then . my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? function wise , what does that do that it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .  th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , it it is an alternative if you think that's gonna sell some if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales it's worth it to do it , but would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . i don't think volume or do you think volume would be no we can do multiple scroll wheels but    i'm thinking something like kinda almost like these pens , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . no ma bit more then th is on here but ju just as a an inspiration , these pens are or from my perspective l_c_d_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , there . it receives no information . don't see any reason for having an l_c_d_ it's an increased cost . unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . right . we have to for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . there's the scroll wheel , in or out ? what do you guys like in the user interface ? dunno about like the flip phone idea , because as far as durability th it's not a big when it's closed .     the the locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s i would imagine . but we i we will need a receiver , an antenna .  it should be a really simple signal though that's true it'll be really cheap . the scroll wheel , in or out ? for me the scroll wheel actually might not be bad . i don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , ","right the two big th points that we have far are the having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell with a plastic interior , my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales it's worth it to do it , but would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . no we can do multiple scroll wheels but i'm thinking something like kinda almost like these pens , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . or from my perspective l_c_d_ is a mistake and all you're doing it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last we have to for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . dunno about like the flip phone idea , the locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s i would imagine . the scroll wheel , in or out ? for me the scroll wheel actually might not be bad . i don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , ",The Marketing Expert expressed concern that the remote lacked enough features to be distinctive.

The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros. The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons. Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful. Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting. "

TS3012b.C," we  that's fine . now work a little with me .  let's start it as it is .  the method . there are a few questions that need to be answered , you already talked about it a little bit . which buttons are wanted , is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need something like a mode that you can switch it . because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . and how big is the remote control going to be ? i'll tell you why that's important to me . there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , that's why i also would like to say go a little bit easy on the designs , heard ab you talking about beeps and about video screens , but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . keep in mind that everything that you keep think of , it has to b to be built .  it's that's not as easy as it s might look like . material study , i'm working on that for the costs . i have to check out how far go with that . normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass and the wires are made of copper . that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , we can just go on with that . then i've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . the more we can make at once in one piece , that is cheaper . exactly , if we make a circuit board with the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . this is what look like looks like if you press one button , this is not the entire thing . you have the power coming in , then you have like a switch . the switch if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a morse code , that's how you should see it . the morse code goes to the amplifier , then the signal is sent to two light bulbs . you have infrared and an interv how to say it ? light in indication , light that that it's functioning . here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote universal , then the processor has to make up a different morse code when some button is pressed . that makes it much more complex , we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . don't have any personal p preferences far , except for the materials to be used light , that they are light . that was it .     no , ","if we make a circuit board with the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . you have the power coming in , the switch if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a morse code , then the signal is sent to two light bulbs . you have infrared don't have any personal p preferences far , except for the materials to be used light , that they are light . ","The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. "

TS3012c.C,"because i had an email , i believe it was from you , against falling .     we have to decide on this anyway . because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials . we have no more than this .     alright . then i proceed , but i need to know after this meeting .  interface , have four things to offer , pu normal push buttons we have a lot of expertise on that one . we have a large history , our company , on push buttons . scroll wheels , those can be pushed as although that is more expensive . liquid crystal colour display and what is this ?  and if we use rubber , i already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons . rubber can only match with rubber . which one of those are we gonna use ?  no . the channels .      but  but it looks no .  flashy and  would be scroll wheel . it's not that much if we take a normal scroll wheel without the pushing , then it's not expensive . we can do that . think . we don't need it , but it's it's design a design thing . they are looking for that . we have young target group . they might find that attractive in a remote con  push buttons we will use . l_c_d_ screen ? is that s only know that if we are using that , we need ano an advanced chip in it . and that is more expensive . i have no idea . i have no absolute numbers . i only have  but i don't think room is really an issue .   electronics , the first one is the chip . that's no longer an option , it has to be an advanced one now . we have the l_c_d_ screen . then we have an infrared sender , that's basic , we cannot do without . otherwise it's not s a remote control . and we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing . are we gonna do that or not ? i only have relative information .  how did you that goes also for the scroll wheel ,    but don't we have any w information about scroll wheel ? scroll wheel . if people would like that . that's strange , because that's the same story . it's not necessary like an l_c_d_ , but it's just it adds something to the design .  no that's r but we now already have to implement an advanced chip . it's m no , but that's  there is still time . yes , this was the last m_s_ . i have a clear picture .   i agree .   no . agree . agreement .  that's true .   that's true .   but according to my information , this would be two curves . we have one left and one right , ",,
