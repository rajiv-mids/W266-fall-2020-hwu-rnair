Bed002.A,"OK , we 're on .  So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .  And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .  Yep .  So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .  No .  No .  Each individually .  We 're talking about doing all at the same time  but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . To try to read them while everyone else is .  So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .  Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .  So .  You can see the transcript ?  There 's two large number strings on the digits ?  So you would just read that one .  And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines .  And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins .  And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes .  Um .  Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone 's here .  OK .  Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings  and then we can go on from there .  Thanks .  So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones .  All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly ,  but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth ,  and then , at the corner .  And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds ,  so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike .  Um .  Yeah , that 's good .  And uh  So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form .  And the short form  I mean , you should read the consent form ,  but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts .  So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like .  Um .  On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can .  If you 're not exactly sure about the region ,  we 're not exactly sure either .  ",,
Bed002.A,"So , don't worry too much about it .  The It 's just self rating .  Um .  And I think that 's about it .  I mean , should I Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?  or ?  Well , what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript .  Um , but not in the audio .  So the  Right , so if I said , "" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? "" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the "" Jerry ""s .  Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .  Um , but uh ,  um , it w uh ,  I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .  Yep .  Right .  Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,  but we find that  We want the meeting to be as natural as possible .  So , we 're trying to do real meetings .  And so we don't wanna have to do aliases  and we don't want people to be editing what they say .  So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .  You know ?  OK .  So th  Um . So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder  and there are lots of different aspects of the project .  Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future .  This is a mock - up of one .  Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood .  Um . The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting ,  and record it ,  and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting .  So that 's my particular interest ,  is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings .  Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings .  Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data .  And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones ,  and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes ,  as well as the close talking mikes .  What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth ,  gives us , um , high quality audio ,  um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus .  ",,
Bed002.A,"So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available .  And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition .  Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results .  So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two .  So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time .  And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously  so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones  and do research like that .  Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC .  And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus .  Um . There 's other work going on in meeting recording .  So , we 're we 're working with SRI ,  with UW ,  Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video .  We 're not including video , obviously .  And uh and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM .  Is also involved .  Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task .  Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings  to give ourselves something easier .  And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits ,  which is a common connected digits corpus .  So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .  Anything else ?  OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless .  It should be on already .  Um .  Either one of those .  And uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms .  So , the most important form is the consent form ,  so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent .  Yeah .  Right .  And uh , just give me a call ,  which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .  And I 'm going to leave the mike here  but it 's n Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on  so don't have them use this one .  It 'll just be sitting here .  ",,
Bed002.B,"So , which is my bar ?  Mah !  Number one .  For our stuff .  Yeah .  I sent an email .  Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,  so you will have to leave what you set .  Input ?  Yeah .  There we go .  Yep .  I got it .  Wel - we I uh I I  It 's really simple though .  So this is the idea .  Um .  We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , uh , I think we we will agree on that , um , to come up with a with a sort of very , very first crude prototype ,  and do some implementation work , and do some some research , and some modeling .  So the idea is if you want to go somewhere ,  um , and  focus on that object down  Oh , I can actually walk with this .  This is nice .  down here .  That 's the Powder - Tower .  Now , um , we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do .  Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it .  And touch it .  But you cannot enter or do anything else .  Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there .  It 's just a dark alley .  But you can touch it .  If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way ,  and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth .  If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , you have to go this way , and go up here .  And there you have a vre really view It exploded , the during the Thirty  years - war . Really uh , interesting sight .  And um , these uh these lines are , um , paths ,  or so That 's ab er , i  the street network of our geographic information system .  And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part .  Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take to lead people this way .  It would always use the closest point to the object ,  and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall ,  but it would do them absolutely no good .  So , what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ .  Maybe you want to enter a building .  ","the street network of our geographic information system .  It would always use the closest point to the object ,  So , what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ .  Maybe you want to enter a building .  ","In the navigational paradigm used for the task, these intentions are to ""see"" to ""enter"" or to ""get to the closest point of"" a building. "
Bed002.B,"Maybe you want to see it ,  take a picture of it .  Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building .  For whatever reason that may be .  Um , r red limestone .  Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it .  Um .  Okay , I This , um These intentions , we w w we could , if we want to , call it the the Vista mode ,  where we just want to eh s get the overview or look at it ,  the Enter mode ,  and the , well , Tango mode .  I always come up with with silly names .  So this "" Tango "" means , literally translated , "" to touch "" .  So But sometimes the the Tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh  If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building .  Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code .  So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point .  So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there .  So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some  Uh , I didn't look through all the data .  um , and there there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people uh , the ways people phrase how to g get if they want to get to a certain place .  And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious  Um . Maybe I should go back a couple of steps  and go through the  You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .  O or later .  They are uncomfortable .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  OK , but that was our idea .  Is  I I think  OK . That was the idea .  Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it .  Sometimes they want to enter it .  And sometimes they want to get really close to it .  That 's something we found .  It 's just a truism .  And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different .  I I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it .  So , this is sort of how people may , uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it .  ","Maybe you want to see it ,  take a picture of it .

Bed002.B,"And we get tons of of these "" how do I get to "" , "" I want to go to "" ,  but also , "" give me directions to "" , and "" I would like to see "" .  And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the the data  That was the wrong one .  um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference .  First of all ,  very important ,  and um , that I 've completely forgot that when we talked .  This is of course a crucial factor , "" what type of object is it ? ""  So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of .  Or very rarely .  But you usually want to enter them .  Some objects are more picturesque ,  and you more f more highly photographed .  Then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants .  Um . Sometimes I found in the Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that that m may also give us a hint ,  um , "" I 'm trying to get to ""  Nuh ?  "" I need to get to "" .  Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on .  And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered .  That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of of a phrase .  So , this is , uh , really  uh , uh , uh  My suggestion is really simple .  We start with , um  Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing .  What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these .  So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure .  Sort of action "" go "" ,  and then an object .  Yeah ?  and a source .  So it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions .  So , I thought , "" Mmm !  Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . ""  Where we can start it and n sort of look  "" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures .  The crude , undifferentiated parse .  Interpreted input .

","However, the starting point is, through the use of existing data, to determine possible linguistic, discourse or situation features that define intentionality. These may include the type of building, time of day, particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native. "
Bed002.B,"And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there ,  and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context .  So this is not something which we can actually monitor , now ,  but just is something we can set .  And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program , depending on on what , um , comes out .  We want to have an a structure resulting  if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode .  Which I think we maybe want to ignore .  But . That 's my idea .  It 's up for discussion .  We can change all of it ,  any bit of it .  Throw it all away .  Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas ,  uh w uh .  So , discourse I I I thought about that .  Of course that needs to sort of go in there .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  People won't want to enter it .  s b  But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I have one more point to to Bhaskara 's question .  Um , I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling .  We can start , you know , basic from human beings ,  model that ,  its motions ,  going , walking , seeing ,  we can mem model all of that  and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives .  That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding .  The parser output ?  "" Analyzed speech "" I think it 's what they call it ,  really , oder  o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get .  In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis .  They call it intention hypotheses .  Well , they keep it .  We have to request it .  Nuh ?  But it 's not in there .  Hmm .  Yeah , or i  Well Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ?  Um ,  because um , sometimes people just say things  This you find very often .  "" Where is the city hall ? ""  And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map ,  ","And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there ,  and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context .  if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines .

","However, the starting point is, through the use of existing data, to determine possible linguistic, discourse or situation features that define intentionality. Consequently, they will be fed into a belief-net -implemented on a software package like JavaBayes- and the conditional probability of each intention calculated. "
Bed002.B,"or they don't wanna know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the your north .  They wanna go there .  That 's what they say , is , "" Where is it ? "" .  Where is that damn thing ?  Well , that 's a a question mark .  sh  A lot of parsers , um ,  just , uh  That 's way beyond their scope , is of interpreting that .  You know ?  But um ,  still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure ,  with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall .  But to interpret it ,  you know ?  somebody else has to do that job later .  Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is ,  at least that 's That 's even what Deep Map does .  It tells you how far away it is ,  and and shows it to you on a map .  Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where where it is .  Mm - hmm .  It 's a granularity factor ,  because where people ask you , "" Where is New York ? "" , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast .  Y y eh you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah .  But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there .  So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well .  So .  So I w this is "" onto "" is is knowledge about buildings ,  their opening times ,  and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should  You know .  Mm - hmm .  Nuh .  History .

But , um , since we are designing a a a an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,  in some shape , way , form over the other ,  to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data .  Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know  an and that 's that but that isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ?  is sort of  s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ?

Bed002.B,"But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still  you know ?  But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net .  So , um , this is exactly what  Because y you can never be sure .

Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know ,  and it understands you completely .

It 's also  No ,  u u y um  the  What I What sort of came to my mind i is was the notion of an idea that if if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on on on on input  which is in file format ,  if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made  and , for example , if if they are in in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t  you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level .  Um , Michael has a project where you know , recognizing discourse acts  and he does it all in MATE ,  and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data .  So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice .  No , no , uh , just for  Nuh .  Just a back door that I I think we should devote m  Two days ?  Two , three days ?  No .  Uh I I I um , OK , I t  Yeah .  I was actually more joking . With the two or three days .  So this was was a usual jo  Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that .  But um , maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked ,  and what it does , and how it does that .  Yeah , or you can split it up .  So , y  ","And the ontology that um , uh the student is is constructing for me back in in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML .  And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .  if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made  and , for example , if if they are in in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t  ",
Bed002.B,"So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to to for slides and whatever net you picked  and what it can do and and how far you 've gotten .  Pppt !  OK .  So this is Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails .  The the full NT and the full Linux version are there .  I 've downloaded them both ,  and I started to unpack the Linux one  Uh , the NT one worked fine .  and I started unta pack the Linux one ,  it told me that I can't really unpack it  because it contains a future date .  So this is the time difference between Germany .  I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it .  Now , um Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine .  And so that we have it .  And then um Hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along ,  we I control p  Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday  is show the state and show the system and show that .  Yeah , but uh but the uh This point is really I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state  where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , "" OK , this is what it usually does ,  and now we add this little thing to it "" ,  you know ?  whatever ,  Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net ,  and we plug it in ,  and then for these certain tasks ,  and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system ,  it all all of a sudden it does much better .  Nuh ?  Because it can produce better answers ,  tell the person , as I s showed you on this map ,  n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point  or a red line that goes to the Tango point  or red line that goes to the door ,  which would be great .  So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go .  Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,  which is what they do now .  And we even had to take out a bit .

Bed002.B,"Nancy , you missed that part .  We had to take out a bit of the road work .  So that it doesn't take you to the wall every time .  So . Um  So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered ,  which nobody have has  because car navigation systems don't really care .  You know , they get you to the beginning of the street ,  some now do the house number .  But even that is problematic .  If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf ,  I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft ,  it takes you to the the address ,  whatever , street number blah - blah - blah ,  you are miles away from the entrance .  Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere .  Nuh ?  but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different .  So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .  Probably neither e not even that .  Do you wanna see a picture ?  Have to reboot for that though .  There there 's more than I showed ,  but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that  and and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,  and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality  but sort of on your intuition of you know , "" Aha !  This is maybe a sign for that ,  and this is maybe a sign for this . ""  Talk features .  Yep .  Well they had they used the ammunition They stored the ammunition in that tower .  And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .  Ahh .  Mmm .  ",,

So you guys who got email about this oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .  Oh , this was about um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words ,  like "" s go to see "" , or "" visit "" , or some  You didn't get it ?

Well , you can sign afterwards .  Afterwards .  And it it it it it also has to be switched on , Nance .  It 's on ?  OK , good .  What ?  OK .  Not important .  So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is .  And , the the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday .  And we think it 's well - formed .  So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .  Well , it 's the it 's it 's always all of it .  So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere .  Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep .  But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing .  ","Oh , this was about um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words ,  like "" s go to see "" , or "" visit "" , or some  So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .  ","The initial task of the EDU group is to work on inferring intentions through context. These may include the type of building, time of day, particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native. "
Bed002.C,"And , so that 's that 's the quote "" deep "" that we 're trying to get at .  And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to  Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it .  It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on .  So , uh ,  and this is Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding ,  there 's gonna be contextual things ,  there 're gonna be linguistic things ,  there 're gonna be discourse things ,  and they gotta be combined .  And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net ,  although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better .  Um , the idea would be that you , uh , take your  You 're editing your slide ?  Oh .  Oh . I 'm sorry .  OK . So . This is minutes taking minutes as we go ,  in his in his own way .

Um .  So that the the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed .  And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things .  And , then the question is  there are two questions  is , uh , one , where do you get this i information from ,  and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ?  So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ?  And you probably need intermediate nodes .  I we don't know what they are yet .  So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether  Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day .  Now , they may wanna call that part of context .  But the time of day matters a lot .  And , if things are obviously closed , then , you  Pe - people don't wanna enter them .

Bed002.C,"And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .

So if someone says something you could ask them .  OK .  And Now , one thing you could do is always ask them ,  but that 's boring .  And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it .  So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , "" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers .  Ask them which one you want . ""  OK .

But that 's that 's fine  an and um ,  all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind .  So they they have worked very hard .  It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards  and ways of interchanging and registering your  a And so forth .  So ,  that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet .

Th - c the full conditional probability table with some function .  OK ?  Which y w you choose appropriately for each case .  So , depending on what your situation is , there are different functions which are most appropriate .  And  So I gave eh Bhaskara a copy of this , eh sort of "" ninety - two "" paper .

So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you ,  that you can convert all that into what the CPT would be .  Um and , what I sent out about a week ago , was an idea of how to do that , for , um , evidence combination .  So one of one function that you could use as your "" G function "" is an e e Evidence - Combining .  So you just take the uh , if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that , then you could take the , uh , strength of each of those , times its little table ,  and you 'd add up the total evidence for "" V "" , "" E "" , and "" A "" .  Yep .  Right .

That 's one of the problems , is , W Is is , Where would th Where would it all come from ?  Yeah , so there 's there 's two separate things , Robert .  The f the the the Bayes - nets in general are quite good at saying , "" if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . ""  OK ?

And I think that 's the one he was getting at .  Well , pretty quickly .  I mean  Eh well to some  No , no .  So , "" Noisy - OR "" is a funny way of referring to this ,  because the Noisy - OR is only one instance .  That one actually isn't a Noisy - OR .  So we 'll have to think of of a way t t  Yeah , whatever .  Yeah .  So Eh Um  Yeah , it it Tha - that 's true .  It is a is also more neural - net - like , although Uh , it isn't necessarily sum uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that .  I mean i You could have ,  uh , like the Noisy - OR function , really is one that 's essentially says , uh , take the max .  Same .  Uh  But anyway .  So  And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the uh  There are a couple other ones .  There are ways of breaking this up into s to to subnets and stuff like that .  But , um  The  I think we definitely I think it 's a great idea tha to to pursue that .  Right .  Oh .  Yeah .  No .  So , i is  Well , let me say something , guys ,  cuz there 's not There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now .  Which is The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology is just what you want for this .  ","The f the the the Bayes - nets in general are quite good at saying , "" if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . ""  So , if you don't have any information about the discourse , you just use your priors of of whatever eh the discourse  uh , like the Noisy - OR function , really is one that 's essentially says , uh , take the max .

Bed005.B,"So that Uh , if you know about it let 's say , a particular town hall that , it 's one that is a monument , then , that would be stored there .  If you don't , you look up the hierarchy ,  Eh so , you you you may or So , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode .  Let 's OK , so we have the EVA vector for for various kinds of landmarks .  If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there .  If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one .  Absolutely .  Uh , or , link to  or  but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology .  It 's part of what you know about a an object , is its EVA vector .  And , if yo As I say , if you know about a specific object , you put it there .  This is part of what Dekai was doing .  So , when we get to Wu , The - e We 'll see w what he says about that .  And , then if you If it isn't there , it 's higher ,  and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior .  If you don't know anything else about a building , uh , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level ,  which might be equal , or whatever it is .  So , that 's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology .  And it seems to me the obvious thing to do , unless we find a reason to do something different .  Does this make sense to you ?  Bhask - ?  Indeed .  So , that 's another thing we 're gonna need to do , is is , to , either  We 're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology , or add fields ,  or some way to associate  Or , w It may be that all we can do is , um , some of our own hash tables that it  Th - the th you know , there 's always a way to do that .  It 's a just a question of  i  th  Yeah .  e  Right .  And , so ,  i  uh  Right .  Yeah .  Well , they they they How ar What are they gonna do with instances ?  I mean , you y  OK .  But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that ?  Cuz , they have instances all the time .  But Uh uh SmartKom 's gonna need an ontology .

Bed005.B,"I understand , but is anybody doing anything about it ?  OK .  It 's a political problem .  We won't worry about it .  Yeah .  Anyway . So we may have to  This is with the whole thing ,  we may have to build another data stru  Conceptually , we know what should be done .  When we see what people have done , it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just pools i i  Like , i i it it may be , that , the the instance  w That we have to build our own instance , uh , things , that , with their types ,  and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type .  So we build a little data structure  And so what we would do in that case , is , in our instance gadget have our E V  And if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type  and then have the E V As for the type .  So we 'd have our own little , uh , EVA tree .  And then , for other , uh , vectors that we need .  So , we 'd have our own little things so that whenever we needed one , we 'd just use the ontology to get the type ,  and then would hash or whatever we do to say , "" ah !  If it 's that type of thing , and we want its EVA vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . ""  So , I I think we can handle that .  And then But , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uh is the bigger deal .  I think that 's where we have to get technically clever .  Well , I me ye eh , yeah , the  Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute .  I mean , you 've been around enough to  I mean  Just ?

Bed005.D,"Or shall I just use this ?  Yeah .  Hey !  Yeah .  So , um Recall that , uh , we want to have this kind of structure in our Bayes - nets .  Namely , that , um You have these nodes that have several bands , right ?  So  Does I mean , they sort of  the typical example is that , um , these are all a bunch of cues for something ,  and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude .  So , uh  Like , let 's just look at the case when , um , this is actually the the final action , right ?  So this is like , uh , you know , touch ,  or  Sorry .  Uh  Yeah ,  E - EVA , right ?  Enter , V View , Approach , right ?  So , this is  Yeah .  Enter ,  View ,  Approach .  Right .  So , I mean , we 'd like to take all these various cues , right ?

Try let me just say "" Landmark "" .  If the thing is a landmark , you know , um then there 's another thing that says if um  if it 's closed or not , at the moment .  Alright , so you have nodes .  Right ?  And the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's "" two to the N ""  Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify "" three times "" , uh , "" two to the N "" probabilities .  Right ?  That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be .

Bed005.D,"The idea is to have these intermediate nodes .  Right .  Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a quote - unquote distinguished state ,  which means that this is the state in which we don't really know anything about it .  So  right ?  So , for example , if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state .  It 's a really , you know , if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee ,  you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state .  So  Yeah , yeah .  That 's just what they the word they used in that paper .  So , the idea is that , um , you have these intermediate nodes , right ?  E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ?  Yeah .  So The idea is that , each of these EI is represents what this would be if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ?  So , for example , suppose that the person I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark .  But none of the other sort of cues really apply .  Then , this would be  W The this would just represent the probability distribution of this ,  assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ?  So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then this would represent the probability distribution .  So maybe in this case Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um They want to view it with probability , you know , point four .  They want to enter it with probability , uh with probability point five  and they want to approach it probability point one , say  Right ?  So we come up with these l little tables for each of those  OK .  And the final thing is that , um this is a deterministic function of these ,  so we don't need to specify any probabilities .  We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ?  So we can let this be , um G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ?  and our example G would be , um , a majority vote ?  Right ?  Mm - hmm .  There 's I mean  yeah .  it 's Heckerman and Breese .  Yeah .

It just happened to be the acronym .  Who doesn't like to be a  Yeah .  ",,
Bed006.C,"Thanks .  OK , wh wh  Yeah .  OK .  Some in some introductions are in order .  OK .  So .  Um . For those who don't know  Everyone knows me ,  this is great .  Um , apart from that , sort of the old gang , Johno and Bhaskara have been with us from from day one  and um they 're engaged in in various activities , some of which you will hear about today .  Ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance  and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type ,  and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper .  Is that a good characterization ?  I don't know .  OK .  Keith is not technically one of us yet ,  ha - ha .  but um it 's too late for him now .  So .  Um .  Officially I guess he will be joining us in the summer .  And um hopefully it is by by means of Keith that we will be able to get a b a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is  and um how we can make it work for us .  Additionally his interest um surpasses um English  because it also entails German ,  an extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading that language .  And um , is there anyone who doesn't know Nancy ?  Do you do you know Nancy ?  OK .  OK .  And um Fey is with us as of six days ago officially ?  Officially ,  but in reality already um much much longer  and um um next to some some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the the data collection she 's also the wizard in the data collection  Um ,  we 're sticking with the term "" wizard "" ,  OK .  and um  Sorceress , I think .  wizard  uh by by popular vote  um  OK , um , why don't we get started on that subject anyways .  Um , so we 're about to collect data  and um the uh s the following things have happened since we last met .  When will we three meet again ?  And um  what happened is that um , "" A "" , there was some confusion between you and Jerry with the that leading to your talking to Catherine Snow ,  and he was uh he he agreed completely that some something confusing happened .  Um his idea was to get sort of the l the lists of mayors of the department ,  the students .  It it 's exactly how you interpreted it ,  sort of s  Ma - majors , majors .  "" Mayors "" .  Majors .  Majors  and um just sending the the little write - up that we did on to those email lists  uh  Yep , yep , yep .  OK .  So .  So , that is uh  Yep .  And  Yep .  Wonderful .  ","Um , so we 're about to collect data  ",
Bed006.C,"And um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact Fey for you know recruiting them for our thing  and um there was some confusion as to the consent form , which is basically that that what what you just signed  and since we have one already um  Um well he said um we definitely "" yes "" ,  however there is always more people in a in a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment  and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all .

Anyhow ,  um the uh  Yeah , not only  Also we will talk about Linguistics and of course Computer Science .  Um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing ,  that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them ,  and so we had a meeting on Friday talking about how to avoid that ,  and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject m to really have intentions  and sort of to act upon those ,  and um  there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job  because it it 's getting more complicated .  So if you know anyone interested in in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to to write a mail to me or Jerry soon ,  fast .  Um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks  "" go shopping ""  um "" take in uh a batch of art ""  um  "" visit  do some sightseeing ""  blah - blah - blah - blah - blah ,  sort of analogous to what Fey has started in in in compiling compiling here  and already she has already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um o um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg .  And um .  So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple ,  such as if if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide "" OK , I wanna do that at this place "" ,  sort of make up their own itinerary a and and tasks  ","And um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact Fey for you know recruiting them for our thing  however there is always more people in a in a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment  Um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing ,  that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them ,  there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job  Um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks  "" go shopping ""  So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple ,  sort of make up their own itinerary a and and tasks  ","Another trial run will take place, while a call to recruit subjects is being emailed to students.

Bed006.C,"and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them ,  but uh  the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects .  And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that "" ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here ""  and "" I wanted to maybe take a picture of that ""  and "" maybe um eat here ""  and then goes in and solves the task with the system ,  IE Fey ,  and um  and we 're gonna try out that  Any questions ?  Mm - hmm . Yeah .  Hopefully .  Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map .  So it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the that information  and An  N not not not really the street network .  Nuh .

And then we 're going to have another we 're gonna have w another trial run  IE the first with that new setup tomorrow at two  and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay  for who those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI .

Which I 'll hopefully sort of scrape together t  But , thanks to Fey , we already have sort of a nice blueprint and I can work with that .  Questions ?  Comments on that ?  If not , we can move on .

Bed006.C,"The question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task .

That 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things  and so  th the q first question for the subject is , "" so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do .

And then you pick pick a movie and and and it show shows you the times  and you pick a time  and you pick seats and all of this .  So .  Pretty straightforward .  But it 's so this time we we are at an advantage  because it was a problem for the German system to incorporate all these English movie titles .  Nuh ?

Bed006.C,"So the person may select "" Huehner Rennen "" or whatever .  OK .  Then uh on to the modeling .  Right ?  Um then modeling ,  there it is .  This is very rough but this is sort of what um Johno and I managed to come up with .  The idea here is that  Yeah this is not an XML  this is sort of towards an a schema ,  nuh ?  definition .  The idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema  such as the Source - Path - Goal  and then we have forced uh motion ,  we have cost action ,  we have a whole library of schemas .  And they 're gonna be , you know , fleshed out in in their real ugly detail ,  Source - Path - Goal ,  and there 's gonna be s a lot of stuff on the Goal and blah - blah - blah , that a goal can be and so forth .  What we think is  And all the names could should be taken "" cum grano salis "" .  So .  This is a  the fact that we 're calling this "" action schema "" right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this "" action schema "" .  But what that means is we have here first of all  on the in the in the first iteration a stupid list of Source - Path - Goal actions  wi  to that schema  and we will have you know forced motion and cost action actions .  So a push may be in in in both you know push uh in this or this  uh  Exactly .  Yeah .  Also , these things may or may not get their own structure in the future .  So this is something that , you know , may also be a res As a result of your work  in the future , we may find out that , you know , there 're really s these subtle differences between  um  even within the domain of entering in the light of a Source - Path - Goal schema , that we need to put in fill in additional structure up there .  But it gives us a nice handle .  So with this we can basically um you know s slaughter the cow any anyway we want .  Uh .  It it is It was sort of a it gave us some headache ,  how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the Enter Source - Path - Goal  that this But this sort of gets the job done in that respect  and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we 're talking about two different things .  We 're talking more on the sort of intention level , up there ,  and more on the this is the your basic bone um schema , down there .  ","Then uh on to the modeling .

Bed006.C,"Well , that wouldn't have helped you at all .

Bed006.C,"But the notion I got from Nancy 's idea was that we may f find sort of concepts floating around i in the a action description of the action f "" Enter "" frame up there that are , e when you talk about the real world , actually identical to the goal of the the S Source - Path - Goal schema ,  and do we have means of of telling it within that  a and the answer is absolutely .  The way we absolutely have those means that are even part of the M - three - L A API ,  meaning we can reference .  So meaning  And um .  This referencing thing however is of temporary nature  because sooner or later the W - three - C will be finished with their X - path , uh , um , specification  and then it 's going to be even much nicer .

But this is a technical detail .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  I mean personally , I 'm looking even more forward to the day when we 're going to have X forms , which l is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the SPG action up there is Enter , then the goal type can never be a statue .

Could happen .  Hmm .  It maybe it means we had nothing to say about the Source - Path - Goal .  What 's also nice , and for a i for me in my mind  it 's it 's crucially necessary , is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel .

Now the the reason for for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back ,  each module will try have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh , you know , entity can have which parents ,  So you always need the whole body of of y your model um to figure out what belongs to what .  Or you always send it along with it ,  ","However, the structure of the model is open for discussion, since its use was to elicit discussion and highlight issues. "
Bed006.C,"So you always send up "" here I am I am this person , and I can have these parents ""  in every message .  which e  It may or may not be a just a pain  it 's it 's  I 'm completely willing to to to throw all of this away  and completely redo it ,  you know and and and it after some iterations we may just do that .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , we I will promise for the next time to have fleshed out N XML examples for a a run through and and see how this this then translates ,  and how this can come about ,  nuh ?  including the sort of "" miracle occurs here "" um part .  And um  is there more to be said ?  I think  um  In principle what I I think that this approach does ,  and e e whether or not we take the Enter - View and we all throw up up the ladder  um wha how do how does Professor Peter call that ?  The uh hhh , silence su sublimination ?  Throwing somebody up the stairs ?  Have you never read the Peter 's Principle  anyone here ?  Maximum incompetence  and then you can throw them up the stairs  um . Yeah .  OK , so we can promote Enter - View all all up a bit  and and get rid of the uh blah - blah - X - blah uh asterisk sub - action item altogether .  No no problem with that  and we w we we will play around with all of them  but the principal distinction between having the the pure schema and their instantiations on the one hand , and adding some whatever , more intention oriented specification um on parallel to that that this approach seems to be uh workable to me .  I don't know .  If you all share that opinion then that made my day much happier .  Yeah .  I 'm I 'm never happy when he uses the word "" roles "" ,  I 'm  OK .  That 's all I have for today .  Oh no ,  there 's one more issue .  Bhaskara brought that one up .  Meeting time rescheduling .  Yeah .  So it looks like  you have not been partaking ,  the Monday at three o ' clock time has turned out to be not good anymore .  So people have been thinking about an alternative time  and the one we came up with is Friday two - thirty ?  three ?  What was it ?  Two - th Two - thirty - ish or three or Friday at three or something around that time .  Um how how are your  And I know that you have until three You 're busy ?  Mm - hmm .

S S  OK , so one question .  This was in this case it 's all um clear , sort of obvious ,  but you can think of the Enter , View and Approach as each having their roles ,  right ?  the I mean it 's it 's implicit that the person that 's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching ,  but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of  they 're sort of like action specific roles and the more general Source - Path - Goal specific roles .  So are we worrying about that or not for now ?  OK .  OK .  What 's that ?  Oh I guess it  I I may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that I 've always viewed things  and that that may or may not be what you guys intended .  But if it is , then the top block is sort of like  um , you know , you have to list exactly what X - schema  or in this action schema ,  there 'll be a certain one , that has its own s structure  and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching ,  but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're  whatever ,  ","But if it is , then the top block is sort of like  and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching ,  ",
Bed006.G,"you know , that which are  think think of enter , view and approach as frames  and they have frame - specific parameters and and roles  and you can also describe them in a general way as Source - Path - Goal schema  and maybe there 's other image schemas that you could you know add after this that you know , how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics  or how do they work in f terms of other things .  So all of those have um basically f either specific frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding .  So the question is are um how to represent when things are linked in a certain way .  So we know for Enter that there 's Container potentially involved  and it 's not  uh I don't know if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema SPG schema  it it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container  and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the Source - Path - Goal um you know goal uh goal I guess in this case .  So uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity basically between things  and I di don't know if that 's something we need to invent  or you know just  It 's OK .  Hmm .  Exactly .  Right , right .  Right .  Yeah .  Oh great .  s Uh - huh .  Great .  That 's exactly what is necessary .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .

Would they both be listed here in  OK .  Under so o under action schema there 's a list that can include both both things .  That 's interesting .  What ?  Oop .  I d f  Yeah I I  I see .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Interesting .  Would you say that the like  I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things ,  but there 's also this sort of like causal ,  ","and you can also describe them in a general way as Source - Path - Goal schema  So all of those have um basically f either specific frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding .  it it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container  and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the Source - Path - Goal um you know goal uh goal I guess in this case .

Bed006.G,"well , so one is really facilitating the other and it 's part of a compound action of some kind , which has structure .  uh I I think that 's nicer for a lot of reasons  but might be a pain  so uh  I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once ,  but in this case it 's really like there 's a purpo means that you know f for achieving some other purpose .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  See that that bothers me that they 're the same thing .  Yeah  because they 're two different things  one of which is l  you could think of one a sub you know pru whatever pre - condition for the second .  Right .  Yeah , yeah .  So . So . OK .  So there 's like levels of granularity .  So uh there 's there 's um a single event of which they are both a part .  And they 're independently they they are events which have very different characters as far as Source - Path - Goal whatever .  So when you identify Source - Path - Goal and whatever , there 's gonna to be a desire , whatever , eating , hunger ,  whatever other frames you have involved , they have to match up in in nice ways .  So it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these schemas  you know from the other  But you know that 's just That 's just me .  Like I I  Mm - hmm .

But having them separate  Well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area .  And I 'm , yeah I 'm I 'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely ,  but yeah I mean like  but it 's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information  which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of "" OK they really want to know if there 's a bakery around here "" ,  which is direct .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Exactly .  It 's I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t you know train station London before ,  yeah .

Bed006.G,"J Do you mean within the Source - Path - Goal actions ?  Those three ?  Hmm .  So there 's a bit a redundancy ,  right ?  in in which the things that go into a particular You have categories at the top under action schema  and the things that go under a particular category are um supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type .  So I guess what 's the function of having it up there too ?  I mean I guess I 'm wondering whether You could just have  under action schema you could just sort of say whatever you know it 's gonna be Enter , View or Approach or whatever number of things  and pos partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories .  And it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy  um but if it has if it 's supposed to be categorized in category X then the corresponding schema X will be among the structures that that follow .  That 's like  OK ,  sorry .  You didn't tell me to  Uh - huh .  But now you guys have seen the light .  So .  I it 's easy to go back and forth  isn't it ?  Uh - huh .  I agree .  Right .  Right .  Which is why I would think you would say Enter  and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to Enter .  And then the things that are abstract will be in the abstract things as well .  And that 's why the bindings become useful .  Um Ye - I see what you mean by that ,  but I I don't if I would I would need to have t have that .  Right .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  I in fact what you could say is for Enter ,  you could say "" here , list all the kinds of schemas that on the category that  you know i  list all the parent categories "" .  It 's just like a frame hierarchy ,  right ?  like you have these blended frames .  So you would say enter and you 'd say my parent frames are such - and - such ,  h and then those are the ones that actually you then actually define and say how the roles bind to your specific roles  which will probably be f richer and fuller and have other stuff in there .  Yeah it could be not a coincidence .

Anyway , so my idea f for today  and we can uh decide that that isn't the right thing to do  was to at spend at least part of the time trying to eh build the influence links ,  you know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions  and actually I had uh specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones .  The database ones being in some sense less interesting to us  although probably have to be done  and so to do that  so there 's and the idea was we were gonna do two things  Ah .  Oh right , well .  Yeah .  We were gonna do two things  one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what  and then as a uh separate but related task  uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we what we need to do .  Once  so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it .  So I didn't did you get a chance to look at all yet ?  Great .  OK so let 's start with the uh belief - nets , the general influence stuff  and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff .  Oh are you gonna go there or not ?  Yeah , so one i  Right ,  true .  Does have to be there .  And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that  Well  so there is this question about  Yeah .  When we 're yeah when we 're done .  So so  the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when  so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all ,  right ?  And so that a decision would be do we want that  so you could two different things you could do ,  you could have all those values for Go - there  or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when .  Yeah  and so forth .  So I 'll let  we 'll see .  OK , that 's let 's start that way .  Right .  No uh  You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ?  Yeah .

Its structure was discussed during the meeting. 
Bed008.B,"Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff .  So this is not just a display ,  this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end .  Doesn't matter .  Let 's  go ahead .  Well yeah . So here 's here 's what 's permissible  is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gonna have to be updated  and n it 's not a belief update ,  right ?  It 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff ,  so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net .  Right ?  And then what you 're going to need is uh for the things that it influences .  Well let 's first of all let 's see if it does influence anything .  And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there .  So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever  but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things .  Well that 's fine .  Well anyway , go ahead .  Yeah , that 's a good question .  And uh does it have a lazy mode ?  I don't remember .  Oh right .  Yeah .  S probably does .  Yeah  someone has to track that down ,  but I but uh  And and and I think actually uh  one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local .  I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying .  Yeah .  So  it 's clear where w w w where we are right now .  So my suggestion is we just pick uh  one , you know one uh particular one of the uh  well let 's do the first first one let 's do the one that we sort of already think we did  so w that was the of the endpoint ?  No , that 's that 's a  although that  Well , that 's  No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true .  OK .  No no no ,  these are ju that 's just a point ,  this is ju  Yeah , would be a f for a given segment .  You know , you y you go first go the town square  That 's subtle , but true .

",
Bed008.B,"and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started .  You 'll see it you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason I wanna do this .  Right .  Right .  We did , but the three things w that that it contributed to this  in fact , the other two aren't up there .  so one was the ontology  Yeah .  And the and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse .  OK , so this is w  Right , so what w I what we seem to need here ,  this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff  the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes  uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse .  So each of those  the way we had it designed ,  now we can change the design ,  but the design we had was  there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations  so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes  and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ?  But the they 're they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about .  Yeah .  Oh , it was called mode ,  so this this is m mode here means the same as endpoint .  OK , why don't we ch can we change that ?  Alright .  You know , but that was actually ,  yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio  that 's I don't think what we would currently do .  That 's a  Yeah .  But that 's - that seems to ,  yeah .  So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence .  But yeah , that was what he had in mind .  So let 's think about this this question of how do we wanna handle  so there 're two separate things .  One is  uh at least two .  One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology  now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that  I think we can  so that the belief - net itself has properties  and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items .  So the let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing ,  the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark  is it a place of business  ","the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes  uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse .  there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations  But the they 're they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about .  So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence .  so that the belief - net itself has properties  and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items .  ","There are several endpoints (User, Ontology, Discourse etc) with separate EVA (Enter/View/Approach) values. "
Bed008.B,"uh is it something you physically could enter  OK ,  et cetera .  So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node  and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set ,  so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow .  Now  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  Yep .  I uh that 's I think that 's completely right  and um I think that 's good ,  right ?  So what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and  in particular  so so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling  no , accessibility meant  OK .  Alright .  So let me suggest this .  Uh w could you move those up about halfway .  Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess .  Right .  So here here 's what it looks like to me .  is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing .  So that it uh  that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important  but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other .  Does that seem right ?  So we di  if we  Yes .  So if well it may be more than endpoint decisions ,  so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three  Yeah .  Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing .  Uh Uh well it it i here 's where it gets a little tricky .  Uh from the belief - net point of view it is  from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth .  So for this decision it 's just uh true or false  and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want .  That that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you uh  are more likely to enter .  You could , yeah .  Yeah , so let 's do that .  No no , no eh to to an inter no , an intermediate node .  That 's the p part of the idea , is  I d  Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are .  Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects ,  we called them entities ,  right ?  Let 's say I put commercial .  Well couldn't I do let 's do commercial  uh landmark  and  Well  accessible I think is different  cuz that 's tempor that that varies temporally ,  ","So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node  and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set ,  so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow .  but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other .  so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three  So for this decision it 's just uh true or false  That that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you uh  are more likely to enter .

Bed008.B,"whereas this is a  I would call that a service ,  but but I don't know .  Say w w well it 's co I would s a a  again for this purpose I think it 's commercial .  Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business .  Well you could ,  that 's a that 's a choice .  So uh  Yeah , the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision ,  now w we may wind up having to do that  this i anyway , this i  at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out .  So , you know what does this look like ,  what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing ,  what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions  and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff .  OK .  Anyway so let me suggest you do something else .  Uh which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint .  No no , I don't want the link there at all .  Because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate thing  which is uh the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based o on the user models ,  so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions ,  so let 's make a new node  Well this was  uh let 's p put it this let 's do endpoint underbar - U .  i endpoint , e end poi  this is sa  it 's the endpoint  let 's say underbar - U ,  so that 's the endpoint decision uh as seen through the  Right .

Now but the now so so but then the question is  uh  so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology ,  but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse .

Well , maybe ,  I again , I d  well , OK , put em in  but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually uh  ","So , you know what does this look like ,  what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing ,  what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions  and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff .  so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology ,  but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse .

Bed008.B,"somebody else has built this user model .  OK .  So uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that .  Alright ?  One is um you could ignore it .  But the other thing you could do is have an  and this will give you the flavor of the of what  you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user .  So you could have a k a "" fit "" node  and again that would have to be computed by someone else  but uh  so that uh  Yeah , that 's all .  Yeah .  I mean , we could .  OK .  Right .  Well that 's what we don't wanna do ,  see that se  cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that  an  Well , but  Well , that that 's we can't do that ,  so we we 're gonna have to  but this is a good discussion ,  we 're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that  uh so if there 's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the uh compatibility with his current state ,  so that 's what you 'd have to do ,  you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact ,  so it could be compatibility with his current state  which would include his money and his time and and his energy  It does .  So it yeah , there are two advantages .  That 's tha there 's one technical one  and the other is it it gets used  Right .  But it there 's two advantages ,  one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential uh CBT 's ,  the other is it can be it presumably can be used for multiple decisions .  So that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u  not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it 's used in multiple places .

Uh  Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse .  So Keith this is gonna get into your world  because uh we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties  s  and so  I I don't yet know how to do this ,  I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties  and we don't know what they are yet .  So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse ,  and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for  Of of course .  Yeah .  Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth .  So in some sense it 's it 's there .  But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet .  But if we do it 'll have the three values .  It 'll have the EVA values  if if we have it .  For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say .  That 's what we talked about .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're you want these two values .  And they 'll be a y uh , a user Go - there  and maybe that 's all ,  I don't know .  OK , good .  Yep .  Right .  ","And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible .  I mean clearly there 's more work to be done on this  but I think it 's gonna be more instructive to to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land .  so in terms of the uh planner what 's what 's a good one to do ?  Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse .  because uh we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties  I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties  and we don't know what they are yet .  For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say .  And they 'll be a y uh , a user Go - there  ","Similarly, a Go-there (towards a building) node can be influenced by things like the user's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things. The study of the linguistic constructions that people use in this kind of navigational domain is expected to be prove useful in that respect. The latter are still ill-defined at this stage. "
Bed008.B,"Right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting ,  so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not  in terms of uh uh you know , whether whether you wanna go there .  Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter .  Well i i it can have di various values .  Yeah , but we eh you you 're right it might not be enough .  Yeah .  Ah .  I see  that could be .  Could be .  Yeah .  N  Yeah .  Yeah . So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link ,  and this is where things are gonna get very messy  from the endpoint uh decision  maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node .  And I don't worry about layout ,  I mean then we 'll go we 'll go nuts  but  Could be ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go - there S  That 's right ,  so the Endpoint node ,  make that up t t to the Go - there then  and again we 'll have to do layout at some point ,  but something like that .  Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way .  Uh really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops  uh  No it 's much worse than that .  It if i loo it it it it it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops ,  you just you have to  there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't  uh  OK .  Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we we , in no , in  Right .  OK , so anyway , so that 's another decision .  Uh what 's what 's another decision you like ?  Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the uh the discourse is is a mystery .  Sure , if you want .  Right .  Sure .  Mm - hmm .  And then also the discourse endpoint ,  I I guess endpoint sub - D is if you wanna make it consistent .  I think so .  S  Maybe not ,  a  Right .  Uh y you yeah you i you if you needed to do that .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Ah .  Good point , I don't I don't know how we 're going to t uh  Right .  ",Uh really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops  ,
Bed008.B,"Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough .  Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it .  And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things  you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ?  But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ?  But I think trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much .  To me .  Alright , but let me let let 's stay with this a minute  because I want to do a little bit of organization .  Before we get more into details .  The organization is going to be that uh  the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that uh  as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed Keith is going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use  and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard ,  so what 's going to happen is that eventually  like by the time he graduates ,  OK  uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net .  I j wa I I assume everybody knows that ,  I just wanna you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then ,  so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes .  And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff  so it isn't by any means uh necessarily a simple thing that you want out .  So uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation  Yeah .  Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes .  an and it 's not clear yet .  I mean it could be those are two separate things ,  it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates em as  which would be my guess  that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that um you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there ,  wow , what does that mean  and uh  Alright .  So  I don't know .  It could be .  This is this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next ,  which is s if that 's true uh how do we wanna combine those ?  O or when it 's true ?  Yeah .  No .  ","so what 's going to happen is that eventually  uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net .

Bed008.B,"Well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big CPT ,  it 's not s completely impossi  I mean it 's it 's not beyond what the system could solve  but it 's probably beyond what we could actually uh write down . or learn .  Uh but , you know it 's four to the fourth .  It 's pretty big .  Uh .  Yeah .

Alright .  So we we just have to figure out what the regularities are and and code them .  But um What I was gonna suggest next is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer  but I do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of  uh  well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place  what rule of combination is used there .  So th yes they so these things all affect it ,  how do they affect it ?  And belief - nets have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that .

So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node .  Right ?  So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain  and it 's so will take a long time to write down  because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities  which is already a lot of numbers to write down .  So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set ,  right ?  These are all like saying EV or A ,  right ?  So it 's not just a generalized situation like  I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of  we wanna view each of these as experts  ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors  and we wanna sort of combine their decisions  and create you know , um sorta weighted combination .

There are several endpoints (User, Ontology, Discourse etc) with separate EVA (Enter/View/Approach) values. "
Bed008.D,"like each node given its parents ,  right ?  So um that 's what we want ,  we want for example P of um  let 's call this guy Y  and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN ,  right .  So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E  given that these guys are  I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something ,  uh the co like all of them ?  Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something  right ?  So we would like to do this kind of combination .  Right .  So , right .  So Basically um what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number  because that 's obviously not desirable .  What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is  and we want it to be a valid probability distribution ,  so we want it to um add up to one ,  right ?  So those are the two things that we uh need .  So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting  and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages ,  right ?  So for example here two people have voted for A ,  one has voted for V ,  and one has voted for E ,  so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four  and similarly , probability of  so this is probability of E  s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four  and probability of V is one out of four .  Right ?  So that 's step that 's the uh yeah that 's the that 's the basic uh thing .  Now  Is that all OK ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So step two is um  right .  So we 've assumed equal weights  whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh  Right .  Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight  so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth  so we could replace this by uh W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four  right ?

Bed008.D,"So they can be for example , you know  you you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say .  And that 'd be one .  So that um also seems to work fine .  And uh  You 'd compute the weighted average ,  so the probability of E would be uh  Not one quarter ,  so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four .  So you can view these as gone .  Probability of  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  So ,  alright .  So this is uh step two .  So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert ,  right ,  whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable .  So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts ,  so what you can have is  you augment these diagrams like this  so  you have a new thing called "" H "" ,  OK ?  This is a hidden variable .  And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four ,  and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation .  Right ?  And then these guys all come here .  OK .  So this is sightly uh more complicated .  So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys  and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable .  So H produces some you know , it produces a number ,  either one , two , three , or four , in our situation ,  right ?

So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished .  How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ?  But OK .  Thus is understandable ?  So here for example .  So here is the the we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions .  There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things .  Um the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life ,  he is he cheap , average , or spendy ?  And um I didn't come uh  maybe a user  I don't know ,  I didn't want to write greediness ,  but  Welcome .  Welcome .  There it is .  And it 's so simple even I can use it .  OK , so here was  OK , I can think of uh people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a a finer scale moderately cheap ,  doesn't matter .  Agree there  but here um I wasn't sure what to write in .  If that 's permissible then I 'm happy .  Yeah .  Hmm .  ","So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones .  Everything that has user comes from the user model  everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A .  So here is the the we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions .  Um the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life ,  ","Similarly, a Go-there (towards a building) node can be influenced by things like the user's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things.

Bed008.E,"Yeah this is where um  OK anyways  let 's forget it .  OK , and so this , oh that  I just accidentally  Oops .  Oh just uh accidentally erased this ,  I I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had "" Is he staying in our hotel ? "" ,  "" Is he staying with friends ? "" ,  and so forth  uh  so we 're  OK .  Something down here ?  Mm - hmm .  And um  Oops .  Ah ,  OK . No no no ,  EVA .  Missed that one .  Um mode was um  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Did I or didn't I ?  Ah . Probably nothing done yet ,  oh I just did it on the upper ones , OK .  Makes sense .  OK , so this was EVA .  Maybe we can think of more things ,  cross  climb , emerge  Mm - hmm ,  mmm . Yeah .  OK , we  w well the uh user was uh definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local  more likely to view if he 's a tourist  um  and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um  We 'll d what type of building is it ?  Yeah .  What he has mentioned before .  Uh we can load it up it you know very simple .  So this was adjusted for this one mode thing .  So that 's w w in our uh in in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something .  Is now this endpoint .  We can just rename that , yeah .  The prosody ?  Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here ,  for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um  if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark ,  meaning more likely to be viewed  if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be entered .  Accessibility .  If it 's closed one probably won't enter .  Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it ,  given that he knows it , of course .  Yeah , all all of these  if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things  These three ?  Yeah .  Um more likely to enter .  Oh , OK .  Um is is that the object type node ?  So are they the is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ?  ","OK , so this was EVA .  if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things  ","Ideas mentioned included grouping features of buildings like ""selling"", ""fixing"" and ""exhibiting"", as well as creating a User-compatibility node that would take different values depending on the situation and the user status. "
Bed008.E,"Oh I just created it , it has none so far .  Yeah .  And then we have sort of the um  Yeah ,  I w I was just gonna  commercial action inside where people p  And where was the accessible , yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Um things .  So places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things .  Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things ,  it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things ,  it 's not either or  mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site .  Many come to mind .  Things can be generally um a landmark and be accessible .  IE a a castle  or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue  you know can go inside .  Could we just move it like this ?  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mmm .  The old one was not that not that important , I think  but  Let 's do it then .  But I can just take this  copy it somewhere else .  This was user something  or  end point ?  Ah .  Gotcha , yeah .  Should I rename this too ?  It 's underscore - E .  OK , shouldn't I be able to move them all ?  No .  Or ?  Can I ?  Where ?  What ?  Wasn't this possible ?  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  OK .  So now we 're looking for user related things that um  Well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now  what was that  people with Harry drove the car into the cafe  Well let 's should we finish this ,  I mean but surely the user interests  yeah , yeah  Here this was one of my problems  we have the user interest is a is a vector of five hundred values ,  so  um That 's from the user model ,  mm - hmm ,  no not levels of interest  but things you can be interested in .  Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus  Yea - n is that  yeah  uh I I think  Mm - hmm .  Uh .  Mm - hmm .  Just as a mental note  uh  Mm - hmm .  And and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering ?  Yeah .  And also if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also  Schedule ?  Bhaskara ?  Yeah .  What do I have under user state anyhow  cuz I named that already something .  Oh that 's tired , fresh ,  yeah .  Maybe should be renamed into physical state .  That 's with a "" G "" ?  Then we can make a user state .  That don't .  ","we have the user interest is a is a vector of five hundred values ,  ",
Bed008.E,"The user interests and the user who who who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke  Maybe um if we look at the if we split it up again into sort of um  if we look at the uh the endpoint again we we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions  so you can only enter a place if you are not too tired to do so  and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something  so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions .  Viewing usually is cheap or free .  Is that always true ?  I don't know .  And so is approaching .  Mm - hmm .  Um  so this might be  What next ?  Well let 's th this  go there or not I think is a good one .  Is a very basic one .  So  what makes things more likely that  So  We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint .  Identified that  and so again re that 's completely correct ,  we have the user model , the situation model here ,  we don't have the discourse model here yet .  Much the same way as we didn't we don't have the ontology here .  Really .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Um  This be specific for second year ?  Um  And and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint .  Hmm ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK just for starters  and here discourse um  um  well , I think um we 're looking at the the little data that we have ,  so people say how do I get to the castle  and this usually means they wanna go there .  So this should sort of push it in one direction  however people also sometimes say how do I get there  in order to find out how to get there  without wanting to go there .  And sometimes um people say where is it  because they wanna know where it is  but in most cases they probably  Oh yeah ,  true .  So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff  and then says here it 's either yep , yay , A , or nay .  Yeah .  OK ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I was just gonna  How long does it take you to to compute uh  uh R recursive action ?  Uh but this isn't , this is this line is just coming from over here .  Mmm .  OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter .  Right ?  I mean this is sort of  This comes from traffic and so forth , yeah .  Sh - Should we just make some  um  if there 's parking maybe  Mmm  Oh who cares .  OK .  ",go there or not I think is a good one .  ,
Bed008.E,"And if he has seen it already or not and so forth ,  OK .  Um  and discourse is something that sort of  should we make a Keith note here ?  That sort of comes from Keith .  Just sort of so we don't forget .  Oops .  Have to get used to this .  OK ,  whoops .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  But  And it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said  what 's the utterance go giving us  and then what 's the discourse history give us .  That 's uh two things then .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm  But is th is this picture that 's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry  or is it that we get for each each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - E , sub - D , sub - U and maybe a sub - O "" O "" for "" ontology "" um meta node  but it might just  could be  so this  but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have at most four at the moment um arrows going f to each of the uh bottom decisions .  And four you we can handle .  It 's too much ?  Right , true .  But but four didn't we decide that all of these had true or false ?  So is it 's four  Um for endpoint ?  No it 's it 's sh  yeah , down here ,  but this one only has two .  Want to view that ,  yeah yeah .  C sl  yeah  R basically w we just need to sort of  in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gonna get this picture sort of uh completely messy .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .

Bed010.A,"Sure .  Right .  Are are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position of of the direction relative relative to the speaker ?  For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English .  We can say um "" park in front of the car "" as you come beh you drive behind the car .  In Hebrew it means "" park behind the car "" , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .  While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car .  So .  Right .  Right .

Um , was this ,  I I think he talked about the idea of like , um He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of for each word you , um  For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in .

Bed010.B,"How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ?  I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff .  Right ?

Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there  I could swore uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point ,  but is there a um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the with the system ?  Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to to look at what look at the stuff , and see what people are saying .  Yeah ,  u OK .  Yeah , I mean I I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those ,  and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know .  It was just Strange ,  but .  Oh yeah ,  OK .  OK ,  yeah , I mean .  Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here  because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff ,  and that was pretty interesting  and you know , I mean ,  seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh to what we 're doing here  because you know people are likely to give descriptions  like you know , "" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , "" or something like that ,  you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff  so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant .  So ,  um , now that was the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction  he 'd what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , "" your bike is parked across the street ""  and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , "" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike "" ,  but um in in Japanese the the more conventionalized tendency is to use a sort of a description of "" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree "" .  ","How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ?

Bed010.B,"Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , "" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river "" , or something like that .  So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on .  But um  But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like "" right where you start to go up the hill "" , or "" just when you get off the train "" , or something like that to uh , to indicate where something is .  So we 'll have to think about  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  OK .  Yeah .  OK .  Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is .  OK .  Right .  I think  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in in English depending o  You know , like , "" in front of the car "" could you know Like ,  here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever .  I could see that ,  but  But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was this was a a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on .  So uh .  Alright !  Cool !  Hmm .  Hmm .  The origin .  Yeah .  Oh , OK .  I never heard it .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .

Bed010.C,"Alright .  Good .  Yeah .  OK so , let 's get started .  Nancy said she 's coming  and that means she will be .  Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start .  So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week  and , I think got a lot done .  It doesn't know "" I "" .  Alright .  So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,  um  Yeah  I thi  Yeah .  So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group ,  but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .  And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .  It 's eee messy  but once you understand it you understand it .  It 's it 's There 's nothing really complicated about it .  Right .  Right .  Now , we 're we 're not committed for our research to do any of those things .  So uh we are committed for our funding .  OK ?  to uh  Yeah , to  n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .  OK ?  So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need .  If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great .  But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts  and , s deliberately .  So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research .  It 's just for closure .  So that if we come up with a question of "" could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? "" or something .  You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .  So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us  we just need to really understand what 's there .  Is there anything we can make use of ?  Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ?  But none of that has a short time fuse .  So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something .  And then So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement .  That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,  ","So uh we are committed for our funding .  n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .

Bed010.C,"but it means we can not think about it for six months .  So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project ,  keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues .  And ,  so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation .  But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,  but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other anything lik any other constraints for the time being .  It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then and get the constructions in their form and stuff .  And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .  Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case  you know , construction parser for general constructions .  And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later .  So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode .  And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well .  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But but we we 're swit  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ?  Just give a talk in the big room , and and so peo people know what 's going on ?  when you 're ready ?  Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing  That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say "" this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it "" and stuff like that .  Indeed .  But any so that e e  It 's clear , then , I think .  Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .  But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where  Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues ,  what 's the ontology look like ,  you know what do the constructions look like ,  what 's the execution engine look like ,  mmm lots of things .  But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out .  Now before we do that , let 's get back in  Oh !

Bed010.C,"But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .  And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the looked at the SmartKom stuff .  Well , the parser , and that stuff .  OK . Anyway .  So , the trip  the report on these  the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .  Maybe you 're done , then .  Anyth - any other uh repo visit reports sort of stories ?  uh we so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .  And so we just push on and and uh , do what we need to do .  And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff .  So .  Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions .  OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it .  Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections .  Right ?  That is So , he 'd put all th all the dots down ,  and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there .  Yeah we may run across one or two more .  But of course the connections weren't .  So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff .  And so Bhaskara tracked that down .  The answer seems to be uh , "" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do "" .  And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks .  So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June ,  and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh hopefully a belief - net that does these things .  ","And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff .  and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there .  So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff .  The answer seems to be uh , "" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do "" .  ",The majority of the nodes are already there. 
Bed010.C,"And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical ,  getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that .  And the other is the actual semantics .  OK ? What all you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate .  So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .  But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out .  Is is that right ?  I mean that 's that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?  OK .  Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .  We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .  That 's separable ,  yeah .  Yep .  Right .  Not not at this point .  Right .  Well , we can p If it 's If we can pay  Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that .  OK ?  So so don't view free as as a absolute constraint .  OK .  And you can ask Kevin .  Hugin ,  yeah that 's free .  Uh , it may be free to academics .  Like I I don't know .  I have a co I have a copy that I l I downloaded .  So , at one point it was free .  Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin  so um ,  HUGIN .  And Bhaskara can give you a pointer .  So then , in any case , um  But paying a lit  You know , if i if it 's uh  Probably for university , it 's it 's gonna be real cheap anyway .  But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it .  I 'm mean , we have no need for that .  No ,  he 's not gonna do that .  Doesn't matter .  Yeah and this is not a crisis that I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape  and and and and then we 'll dig d dig down on this .  Right .  Well there there there There 're two different things you do .  One is you design and the other is you learn .  OK ?  So uh what we 're gonna do initially is is do design , and , i if you will , guess .  OK .  Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .

There 's this EDU  Right ?  Or a link to it .  Just  Maybe just put a link on .  Yeah .  By the way , there something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .  So there 's there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and and so forth .  So this is all This is There 's this linguistic facts .  But apparently , the Uh . Here 's the way the findings go .  That , you know they do MRI , and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up ,  and if something 's out of reach uh a different one .  But here 's the the amazing result , um , they say .  You get someone with a with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things .  So the s typical task is subdivision .

Bed010.C,"So there 's a a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , "" Where 's the midpoint ? ""  And they do fine .  If you give them the line , and they have to touch it ,  they can't .  There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that .  Here 's the real experiment .  The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , "" where is it ? "" ,  they do it .  Give them a stick , long stick , and say "" do it "" ,  they can't do it .

How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly .  Not indirectly ,  but you actually can feel the tip .

And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction .  Of course there are behavioral differences too .  Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't .  But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference .  And i this is , um  So .

Bed010.C,"Well there 's there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw .  Anyway yeah , so we 'll we 'll look at this .  And . So , all of these issues now are now starting to come up .  So , now we 're now done with demos .  We 're starting to do science ,  right ?  And so these issues about uh , reference , and spatial reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,  um So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now .

Bed010.C,"but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that .  So we 've talked about it ,  and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing ,  and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .  But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece .  It was just this uh construction analyzer .  And so we think we think we have a shot at at that .  So . The for  So .  To to come full circle on that , this formalization task ,  OK ?  is trying to get the formalism into into a shape where it can actually uh  d Well , yeah ,  where it actually is is covers the whole range of things .  And the the the the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do ,  and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms .  It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .  And it just it was just terribly frustrating for him ,  and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .  And .  Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .  Uh . Huh ?  Is This is true ,  is it not ?  OK .  So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .  We - well it hasn't it it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .

But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , is real hard .  OK .  And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,  OK ,  uh , for his absentee thesis .  I think you all know that that you can just , in Germany almost just send in your thesis .  Yeah right .  OK .  It costs a lot .  The the amount You put in your credit card and as well .  But , uh ,  But anyway ,  so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks ,  ","To to come full circle on that , this formalization task ,  is trying to get the formalism into into a shape where it can actually uh  ",
Bed010.C,"so that that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into .  And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .  So , de Uh . And her name is Eva .  It really is .  Nobody believed th th that  Yeah .  No , first year coming .  So , she 's she 's now out here  she 's moved ,  and she 'll be a student as of then .  And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff ,  so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .  Uh .  Uh , against all traditions .  And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this .  Uh  No ,  interestingly enough .  Some of th some of them , yeah .  So anyway ,  uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on .  Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read .  So we 'll see how this goes .  Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest ,  so we 'll see how that goes .

We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not ,  I 'm not sure .  It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes .  S so , we 'll see .  And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it  and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,  so uh and ,  I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions .  I suspect that 's right .  OK ,  fine .

Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a er in XML  and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else .  And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form .  And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog .  So , you have a basically , a goal  and it , you know , says "" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,  so it just starts uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold .  Basically , it just means "" build the tree . ""  And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .  We  yeah .  So , the syntax trees are very simple .  It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,  and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those .  And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the from the LISP .  And so basically you just say , you know , "" noun goes to "" , you know ,  Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those .

The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like "" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . ""  It actually says , "" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , ""  which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .  So uh ,  Um , the uh  The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them .  And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach .  So I 'm I 'm I 'm going backwards now ,  so "" synthesis "" is where you sort of make this uh , make these sounds ,  and "" concept to speech "" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure  so it can pronounce things better , presumably .

Yeah , for a couple  But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the the syntax trees for three or four .  And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff ,  and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us .  So .

And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal "" group - ware "" server at EML ,  make that open to all of us and them ,  so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and and generating and constructions w we we sort of uh put it in there  and they put what they do in there  ","but it 's working now ,  we can even make a sort of an internal demo ,  Absolutely .  Well d we we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're  Um . Well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is ,  And I g I got the feeling that we are the only ones right now who have a running system .  e the version that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work .  And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal "" group - ware "" server at EML ,  make that open to all of us and them ,  so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and and generating and constructions w we we sort of uh put it in there  and they put what they do in there  ","The system is still buggy and unstable, but it will soon be ready for a demonstration.

Bed010.E,"and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that .  And um ,  the , uh  If I find someone at in EML that is interested in that , um I I may even think that we could look take constructions and and generate from them  because the tree adjoining grammars that that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism .  And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction .  So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there ,  but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .  Absolutely .  We had um decided  Um . Well , no , we didn't decide .  We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer ,  but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .  Yeah .  But  But  I I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in in in changing the the JavaBayes code .  I I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that ,  it 's sort of a fish - eye .  You you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,  and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle .  And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two .  If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we we need to solve right now .  What I 'm what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of of the internal structure .  Maybe node by node , or something like this ?  Or should I collect it all  and  OK .  And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ?  Or will that change ?  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah , that 's  Yeah .  OK .  No , that 's good .  That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it .  So .  It 's  Yeah .  Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .

And um one just s sort of has to watch which also final decision node so it doesn't make sense t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place .  And um And for now uh the the question is "" How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection ? ""  ",
Bed011.C,"we could s call it "" Visit the zoo tomorrow "" ,  so we have an intention of seeing something , but not now but later .  Hmm .  Hmm , hmm .  Yeah The the reason why we did it that way , as a as a reminder , is uh no person is gonna do all of them .  They 're just gonna select u um , according to their preferences .  "" Ah , yeah , I usually visit zoos , or I usually visit castles , or I usually ""  And then you pick that one .  Yeah , the this was sort of these are all different sort of activities .  Um But I think y I I got the point and I think I like it .  We can do put them in a more hierarchical fashion .  So , "" Go to place "" and then give them a choice ,  you know either they 're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say "" yeah this is on that "" go to big - ish place "" ,  this is what I would do . ""  And then we have the "" Fix "" thing , and then maybe "" Do something the other day "" thing ,  so . My question is  I guess , to some extent , we should y we just have to try it out and see if it works .  It would be challenging , in in a sense , to try to make it so so complex that they even really should schedule , or to plan it , uh , a more complex thing in terms of  OK ,  you know , they should get the feeling that there are these s six things they have to do  and they sh can be done maybe in two days .  So they make these decisions ,  "" Can I go there tomorrow ? ""  or you know influences  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , but I think this is part of the instructor 's job .  And that can be done , sort of to say , "" OK now we 've picked these six tasks . ""  "" Now you have you can call the system and you have two days . ""  And th w  Yep , yep .  Yeah , but th the I don't I 'm not really interested in sort of "" Phase planning "" capabilities .  But it 's more the how do people phrase these planning requests ?  So are we gonna masquerade the system as this as you said simple response system ,  "" I have one question I get one response "" ,  or should we allow for a certain level of complexity .  And a I w think the data would be nicer if we get temporal references .  I mean w we have tested this and a y  ",,
Bed011.C,"have you heard listen to the f first two or th  as a matter of fact the second person is uh is was faced with exactly this kind of setup .  And  Oh , OK .  That was the first subject .  Yeah .  Um , it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex .  Maybe I suggest we make some fine tuning of these , get sort of run through ten or so subjects  and then take a breather ,  and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not , depending on what what sort of results we 're getting .  And y and always  And with this we 're getting more .  No question .  uh w do we wanna get going beyond more , which is sort of the  This means audio , but  no transcriptions of course ,  yeah .

And the reading ,  nobody 's interested in that except for the speech people .  So .  It 's actually like five minutes dialogue .  Ten minutes is long .  Yeah .  It feels like forever when you 're doing it ,  but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds .  Yeah , it 's not  And it 's fun .  OK .  Yeah .  I need those back by the way .  That 's for  And  no , th the per  the person don't get it .  I mean , this is why we did it , because when we gave them just three tasks for w part - A and three tasks for part - B a  Exactly .  This is limiting the choices , but yeah .  Right .  OK , sorry .  But um I I think this approach will very well work ,  but the person was able to look at it and say "" OK , This is what I would actually do . ""  Yeah .  OK .  OK , we gotta we gotta disallow uh traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time , sort of  But no , they 're I mean they 're sort of this is where tour becomes you know  tourists maybe a bit different  and , um , these are just places where you you enter um , much like here .

Bed011.C,"So since people gonna still pick something , we we 're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy .  And for reasons , we don't want it , really , in that sense .  And um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking , oh , for different things with or with a computer .  And so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just m mail them to us and we 'll sneak them into the collection .  We 're not gonna do much statistical stuff with it .  No .  But it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects  and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t takes off to Chicago .

I 'm also interested in th in this "" property "" uh line here ,  so if you look at sorry , look at that  um , timing was um I have these three .  Do we need a final differentiation there ?  Now , later on the same tour , sometimes on the next tour .  It 's sort of next day ,  so you 're doing something now and you have planned to do these three four things ,  and you can do something immediately ,  you could sort of tag it on to that tour  or you can say this is something I would do s I wanna do sometime l in my life , basically .  Well , my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel ,  so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think .  I don't know .  What is the uh the the English co uh um cognate if you want , for "" Sankt Nimmerlandstag "" ?  Sort of "" We 'll do it on when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen .  Do you have an expression ?  Probably you sh  Yeah , when hell Yep , we 'll do it when hell freezes over .  So maybe that should be another property in there .  OK .  Um , the reason why why do we go there in the first place  IE uh it 's either uh for sightseeing , for meeting people , for running errands , or doing business .  Entertainment is a good one in there , I think .  I agree .  Yep .  I mean this w this is uh an old uh Johno thing .  He sort of had it in there .  "" Who is the the tour is the person ?

"" I want to meet someone somewhere "" , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the "" EVA ""  you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually ,  you 're just want to approach it .

Um , "" mode "" ,  uh , I have found three ,  "" drive there "" , "" walk there "" uh or "" be driven "" , which means bus , taxi , BART .  Yeah .  Yep .

OK , "" Length "" is um , you wanna get this over with as fast as possible ,  you wanna use some part of what of the time you have .  Um , they can .

You know , they wanna do it so badly that they are willing to spend uh you know the necessary and plus time .

Bed011.C,"Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning , that it 's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what 's s sort of important in this general picture , what you need t  If you wanna simulate it , for example , what parameters would you need for the simulation ?

The what what my sort of sentiment is they 're  Well , I I once had to write a a a a charter , a carter for a a student organization .  And they had wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be .  And I looked at the other ones and they always said ten percent of the student body has to be present at their general meeting otherwise it 's not a  And I wrote in there "" En - Enough "" people have to be there .  And it was hotly debated , but people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce , a joke , or whether there were enough people .  And if you go to Turkey , you will find when people go shopping , they will say "" How much cheese do you want ? ""  and they say "" Ah , enough . ""  And the and the this used all over the place .  Because the person selling the cheese knows , you know , that person has two kids and you know , a husband that dislikes cheese , so this is enough .  And um so the middle part is always sort of the the golden way ,  right ?  So you can s you can be really make it as cheap as possible , or you can say "" I want , er , you know , I don't care ""  Money is no object ,  or you say "" I just want to spend enough "" .  Or the sufficient , or the the appropriate amount .  But , Then again , this may turn out to be insufficient for our purposes .  But well , this is my first guess ,  in much the same way as how how d you know should the route be ?  Should it be the easiest route , even if it 's a b little bit longer ?  No steep inclinations ?  Go the normal way ?  Whatever that again means , er or do you does the person wanna rough it ?  Well , this is all sort of um , top of my head .  No no research behind that .

Bed011.D,"OK , so Eva , co uh could you read your numbers ?  Yeah .  Yeah , let 's get started .  Um Hopefully Nancy will come ,  if not , she won't .  Yeah .  I think so .  Right , right .  So Yeah .  So let me pop up a level .  And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same .  So What we 're gonna do today is two related things .  Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions .  And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules .  so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters .  So to do that , we need to do two things .  One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount .  Then we need to figure out what influences its choices  and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff .  But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today .  Technical stuff we 'll do uh another day .  Probably next week .  But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them .  And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues .  So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh in here , and have them actually record like this .  Uh record dialogues more or less .  And depending on what Fey sort of provokes them to say , we 'll get information on different things .  So  Fo - v yeah people with the phrase them  and so Uh for , you know , Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go .  So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up ,  and , the kinds of decisions .  So the uh uh on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values .  So if if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions ,  and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that .  And he has a handout .  Yeah .  S I don't see a release  Got it .  OK , fine .  OK .  ","So What we 're gonna do today is two related things .

Um , pretty much , yes ,  but I think it 's a little bit more complex .

Well now , y I mean , you could  Uh , out of curiosity , is there a reason why we wouldn't combine these three nodes ? into one smaller subnet ?  that would just basically be the question for  We have "" where is X ?

You won't it 'll be hard to decide .  But I mean , I guess I guess the thing is , uh , this is another , smaller , case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty ,  which makes me think Bayes - net should be the way to solve these things .  So if you had If for every construction ,  right ?  you could say , "" Well , there Here 's the Where - Is construction . ""  And for the Where - Is construction , we know we need to l look at this node , that merges these three things together  as for th to decide the response .  And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with , we could have a finite number of nodes .  Say , if we had to y deal with arbitrary language , it wouldn't make any sense to do that ,  because there 'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence .  But since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff  Yeah , so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief - net .  Well , I mean , d For the Where - Is question .

Bed012.C,"Yeah , but But how does the expert but how does the expert system know how who which one to declare the winner , if it doesn't know the question it is , and how that question should be answered ?  Yeah I know . But how do we weight what we get out ?  As , which one i Which ones are important ?  So my i So , if we were to it with a Bayes - net , we 'd have to have a node for every question that we knew how to deal with ,  that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question .  Does that make sense ?  Yay ,  nay ?  We  Well , no . I I guess my question is , Is the reason that we can make a node f  or OK . So , lemme see if I 'm confused .  Are we going to make a node for every question ?  Does that make sense ?  Or not .  Every construction .  Wel  W OK .  So , someone asked a question .  How do we decide how to answer it ?  Yeah .  I just don't think a "" winner - take - all "" type of thing is the  Wel  I don't know about that ,  cuz that would suggest that I mean  Do they have to be mutual  Yeah . Do they have to be mutually exclusive ?  Cuz I , uh The way you describe what they meant , they weren't mutu uh , they didn't seem mutually exclusive to me .  Wel  Well , yeah , just out of the other three , though , that you had in the  those three nodes .  The - d They didn't seem like they were mutually exclusive .  So th s so , yeah , but some So , some things would drop out , and some things would still be important .  But I guess what 's confusing me is , if we have a Bayes - net to deal w another Bayes - net to deal with this stuff ,  you know ,  uh ,  is the only reason OK , so , I guess , if we have a Ba - another Bayes - net to deal with this stuff , the only r reason we can design it is cuz we know what each question is asking ?  And then , so , the only reason way we would know what question he 's asking is based upon  Oh , so if Let 's say I had a construction parser , and I plug this in , I would know what each construction the communicative intent of the construction was  and so then I would know how to weight the nodes appropriately , in response .

There was a confusion there ,  k I didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the Bayes - net ,  because some of the things aren't relevant in the Bayes - net for a specific question .

And it 's also difficult to even if you had a lot of substance , it 's hard to demonstrate that in four pages , basically .  Um .  I mean it 's still it 's still  Uh - huh , uh - huh .  OK .

Well , you don't have t  I mean the conference may be cognitive neural ,  doesn't mean that every paper has to be both .  Like , NLP cognitive neural .  So i so this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side  although it could reference the NTL - ish sort of , like , um , approach .  Yeah .  The fact that the methods here are all compatible with or designed to be compatible with whatever , neurological neuro neuro - biol su stuff .  Yeah , I guess four pages you could  I mean you could definitely it 's definitely possible to do it .  It 's just It 'd just be small .  Like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail ,  but you can use an example of it .  Yeah , yeah .  So it be like using the formalism rather than you know , introducing it per se .  So .  Yeah .  And people will sort of figure out or ask about the bits that are implicit .

Or any variants of that .  s  That it has a location or something like that ?  or th the ontology will tell us where actually it is located ?  OK .  OK . OK .  OK .  So you 're talking about , for instance , the construction obviously involves this entity or refers refers to this entity ,  and from the construction also you know that it is a location  is or a thing thing that can be located .  Right ? Ontology says this thing has a location slot .  Sh - and that 's the thing that is being that is the content of the question that 's being queried by one interpretation of "" where is X "" .  And another one is , um , path from current user current location to that location .  So .  So is the question  I mean it 's just that I 'm not sure what the  Is the question , for this particular construction how we specify that that 's the information it provides ?  Or or asked for ?  b Both sides , right ?  ","Wait , wait , what 's the middle thing ?  ",
Bed013.A,"Observed when you heard the speaker say "" where is X "" , or when when that 's been parsed ?  So these little circles you have by the D ?  Is that ?  OK . OK .  Is - uh ,  Yeah .  So un  So I agree with that .  I have a different kinda question ,  might be related ,  which is , OK so implicitly everything in EDU , we 're always inferring the speaker intent , right ?  Like , what they want  either , the information that they want , or  It 's always information that they want probably , of some kind .  Right ?

So I don't know if the I mean i if th just there 's more s here that 's not shown that you it 's already like part of the system whatever ,  but , "" where is X "" , like , the fact that it is , you know , a speech - act , whatever ,  it is a question .  It 's a question that , um , queries on some particular thing X ,  and X is that location .  There 's , like , a lot of structure in representing that .  So that seems different from just having the node "" location - X ""  and that goes into EDU , right ?  So tha is that what you 're t talking about ?  wh what kinds of structure we want .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  OK . So in some ways  um , so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of mo more linguistic meetings we 've been talking about possible semantics of some construction .  Right ?  Where it was  the simulation that 's , according to it you know , that that corresponds to it , and as well the as discourse ,  whatever , conte infor in discourse information ,  such as the mood ,  and , you know , other stuff .  So , are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that , that 's tailored to this problem ?  Cuz that that has , you know , basically , you know , s it 's in progress still  it 's in development still ,  but it definitely has various feature slots , attributes , um , bindings between things  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  For the subset of  OK .  OK . That exactly "" where is X "" ,  not the the choices of "" where is X "" or "" how do I get to X "" .  Just "" where is X "" .  OK .

So , you could say that the s construction is a question asking about this location ,  and then you can additionally infer , if they 're asking about the location , it 's because they wanna go to that place ,  in which case , the you 're jumping a step step and saying , "" oh , I know where it is  but I also know how to get they wanna seem they seem to wanna get there so I 'm gonna tell them "" .

Well then , he probably should be coming back a year from now .  Well , once the system understands things .  I just don't think I think we 're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things .  The basic idea I guess would be to give allow the system to have intentions , basically ?  Cuz that 's basically what needs to be added to the system for it .  Well we 'd have to seed that ,  I mean .  It wouldn't know what to ask .  I mean .  Unless it was in a situation .  We 'd have to set up a situation where , it didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there .  Which means that we 'd need to set up an intention inside of the system . Right ?  Which is basically , "" I don't know where something is and I need to go there "" .  Well , no I guess not .  Excel  Sure .  Well , it will d r assign values to all the nodes . Yes .  I 'm just  I guess what I 'm afraid of is if we don't , you know , set up a situation , we 'll just get a bunch of garbage out ,  like you know , everything 's exactly thirty percent .  Well that was that was absurdly low , in the last meeting ,  cuz I went and looked at it  cuz I was thinking , that could not be right ,  and it would it was on the order of twenty output nodes and something like twenty  thirty input nodes .  So to test every output node , uh , would at least  Let 's see , so it would be two to the thirty for every output node ?  Which is very th very large .

Bed013.B,"a number  two to the thirty is like a  Bhaskara said , we had calculated out and Bhaskara believes that it 's larger than the number of particles in the universe .  And if i  Two to the thirty ?  Well , two to the thirty is a billion ,  but if we have to do it two to the twenty times , then that 's a very very large number .  Cuz you have to query the node , for every a uh , or query the net two to the twenty times .  Or not two to th  excuse me , twenty times .  Yes .  As far as  That 's @ @ That 's big .  Actually  Oh ! We calculated a different number before .  How did we do that ?  If it takes us a second to do , for each one , and let 's say it 's twenty billion , then that 's twenty billion seconds ,  which is  Eva , do the math .  Hours and hours and hours and hours .

Well , there was like we needed to or uh , in my opinion we need to design a Bayes another sub - Bayes - net  You know , it was whether it was whether we would have a Bayes - net on the output and on the input ,  or whether the construction was gonna be in the Bayes - net ,  a and outside of it ,  and  Well that was related to what we were talking about .  Yeah sure .  What ?  Oh , oh , oh , oh .  I 've blocked every aspect of Phil Collins out of my mind .  Wait , what are the dots ?  I don't remember what the dots were .  Oh , oh .

And um , maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for Eva  because she has been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough .  So this is so weird it should even make you happy .  Imagine if you will , that we have a system that does all that understanding that we want it to do based on utterances .  It should be possible to make that system produce questions .  So if you have the knowledge of how to interpret "" where is X ? "" under given conditions , situational , user , discourse and ontological conditions , you should also be able to make that same system ask "" where is X ? ""  in a sper certain way ,  based on certain intentions .  So in instead of just being able to observe phenomenon , um , and , guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention , and make it produce an utterance .  Absolutely .

So these are issues  but we what we actually decided last week , is to , and this is , again , for your benefit is to um , pretend we have observed and parsed an utterance such as "" where is the Powder - Tower "" ,  or "" where is the zoo "" ,  and specify um , what what we think the the output uh , observe , out i input nodes for our Bayes - nets for the sub sub - D , for the discourse bit , should be .

And then , um , over in your Bayes - net or whatever , when when the person says "" where is it "" , you 've already got , you know since they were talking about admission , and that evokes the idea of entering , um , then when they go and ask "" where is it "" , then you 're Enter node is already active  because that 's what the person is thinking about .

",
Bed014.C,"So  that 's , uh looks pretty good .  And um  Yeah , I 'll say it now .  So , um  And it looks to me like we 're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard .  We 've been so far working on things that are easy .  Uh , w Which is mental spaces and uh and - or  Huh ?  It 's a hard puzzle .  But the other part of it is the way they connect to these , uh , probabilistic relational models .  So there 's all the problems that the linguists know about , about mental spaces , and the cognitive linguists know about ,  but then there 's this problem of the belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets .  Uh , which they call dynamic  they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets .  So there 's a term "" dynamic belief - net "" , doesn't mean that .  It means time slices .  And Srini used those and people use them .  Uh . But  one of the things I w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more , is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds  and  uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences .  So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances  and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff ,  so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate .  But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's it 's putting together two real hard problems .  One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings  and and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings ,  you know , between let 's say between the past and the present ,  or any other one of these things  and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work  if it 's got um , let 's say one in in , you know , different tenses  or my beliefs and your beliefs ,  or any of these other ones of of multiple models .  So um  you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those  ","And it looks to me like we 're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard .

And sometimes it 's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one  because they constrain each other .  I mean if you 've got huge ra huge range of possible choices  um  We 'll see .

So this should be semantic and  Th - so this definitely should be "" semantic constraints "" down at the bottom ?  OK .  Or  Well he w he went to college here .  Mmm .  Hmm .  So we 're building a mental space , good .  I see .  Right .  Well every time Nancy giggles it means it means that it 's your job .  I r I read that paper ,  the hedges paper ?  I read some of that paper actually .  Oh , man .  Mmm .  There 's that quote in Jurafsky and Martin where where it goes where some guy goes , "" every time I fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up . ""  Ooo , can I ask a  Can I ask a quick question about this side ?  Is this , uh was it intentional to leave off things like "" inherits ""  and  Yeah ,  like constructions can inherit from other things ,  am I right ?  Yeah .  OK .  Mmm .  You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper .  The pressure 's on you Nancy .  ","Is this , uh was it intentional to leave off things like "" inherits ""  ",
Bed015.C,"Oh right .  What I was gonna  Right .  Oh , I see .  So so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct  OK , that 's fine .  Mm - hmm .  Good .  Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy .  So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I  s For sure .  I mean , I don't know what , uh , term we want to use  but we don't want to  Yep .  It 's g it 's gone .  Th  I know .  Anyway , so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put , you could put no word ,  just meaning .  OK ?  And the then let  OK .  Oh , whatever .  Or wh  That - b  Right .  Minor min problem  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Good .  A a and the  Yeah .  And there 's uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head .  And and this enables you to get that , if I understand you right .  Yeah yeah .  Right .  OK , so that all looks good .  Let me  Oh , w Oh .  I don't know .  Were you finished ?  OK .  So , i if I understand this the  aside from , uh , construed and all that sort of stuff , the the differences are mainly that , we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type  or actually gone back to ,  if we go back far enough  Oh , I see .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  I 'm sorry ,  you 're right .  A construction type .  Uh , that 's fine .  But it , um  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  No , no , no , I don't think so .  I think that you 'll you 'll do fine .  In fact , these are , um ,  as long as as Mark isn't around , these are form constraints .  So a nominal expression is uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic .  The fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression I would say on most people 's notion of of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one .  And I think that 's just fine .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  That I I have no problem with it at all .  I think it 's fine .  Right .  But they do .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  But it y y it 's yeah , just moving it moving the c the cons the constraints around .  OK , so that 's  Right .  ",But they do .  ,
Bed015.C,"And so that was the  OK , and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair .  Instead of just the meaning .  And that aside from some terminology , that 's basically it .  I just want to b I 'm I 'm asking .  Yeah .  The whole the mental space thing is clearly not here .  By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back .  So , uh , the the mental space thing .  Um , obviously , construal is a b is a b is a big component of that  so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back .  But sort of as soon as he gets back I think um , we ought to  Yeah .  And furthermore it 's well worth missing .  Right .  OK , so that 's great .  Right .  Right .  Right .  Right .  Right .

Oh , I yeah , I , uh , uh I think that 's Not k I th  I don't think it 's completely right .  I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b  the form did constrain the meaning ,  and so , um , it isn't , uh  Yeah .

And , um I mean , you 're you 're the linguist  but , uh , it seems to me that th these we we you know , we 've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something .

Bed015.E,"You know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of  I think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know  assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . The , um the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to .

So for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be  like the question is for example , what does "" Watergate "" refer to there ?  Does it , you know does it refer to , um  if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say "" Watergate "" you 're referring to "" a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France "" .

Bed015.E,"There 's things like ther you know , there 's all kinds of stuff like , um , in I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a a verb of saying then  um , you know , you say something like or or I was thinking you can say something like , "" oh , I thought , uh , you are a republican "" or something like that .

So , um ,  here .  If you could pass this around ?  And there 's two things .  And so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification .

So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin .  Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are all these things are  it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .  And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .  Um , maybe I will  let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation ,  um , because that 's ,  I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um to people .

And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this .  There there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth .  But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name .  I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .  So something like , um  Well , there 's an example  the textual example at the end has clausal construction .  So ,  um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful  It could be , you know , simple old text as well .  Um , there are a couple of  Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things .

Bed015.F,"So they could all have a type at the beginning .  Um , and then they say the key word construction  and they have some name .  Yeah , right .  OK , and then it has a block that is constituents .  And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk one type of constituent ,  that is a constructional constituent .  I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind .  But in general instead of the word "" construct "" , th here you might have "" meaning "" or "" form "" as well .  OK ?  So if there 's some element that doesn't that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning .  OK ,  um , the main change with the constructs which each of which has , um , the key word "" construct "" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's  it 's pro it 's often sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is .  So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word "" throw "" ,  or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , "" happy "" , or something like that .  Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word  or maybe you 'll have the type .  You 'll say "" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here ""  or "" I need a directional specifier here "" .  So - uh you could have a j a actual type here .  Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type .  So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind ,  often a human .  Right ?  So if I you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I  I I run down the street ,  it 's typed , uh , "" I "" ,  meaning category is what 's there .  The the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair  and , um ,  sort of skipping fonts and whatever .  The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need .  It 's it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there .  And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .  And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about ,  ","So they could all have a type at the beginning .  Um , and then they say the key word construction  OK , and then it has a block that is constituents .

And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .  ",The different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them. 
Bed015.F,"about what meaning what specific meaning you want .  So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion ,  you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , "" the big th "" , you you know , "" the big the tall dark man "" , you know , "" walked into the room "" .  But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind  but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal ,  and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun  or to some complicated expression .  Um ,  so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types .  So .  OK , then I don't think the , um  at least  Yeah . None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ?  But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope ,  right ? which here are the constructs , to say something about the relation .  And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript .  The F subscripts refer to the "" form "" piece of the construct .  And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous .  Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that .  So so by saying if I just said "" Name one "" then that means name one formal  and we 're talking about formal struc Which which makes sense .  Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that ,  in which case you could just indicate "" here I mean the meaningful for some reason "" .  Right ?  Or Actually it 's more often that , only to handle this one special case of , you know , "" George and Jerry walk into the room in that order "" .  So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form .  But but s we 're not gonna really worry about that for right now  and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on .  OK , and so in terms of the the relations ,  you know , as usual they 're before and ends .  I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation  but in form you might also have a value binding .  ",,
Bed015.F,"You know , you could say that , um , you know , "" name - one dot "" , t you know , "" number equals "" , you know , a plural or something like that .  There are certain things that are attribute - value , similar to the bindings below  but I mean they 're just us usually they 're going to be value value fillers , right ?  OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings .  There was talk of changing the name of that .  And Johno and I I you you and I can like fight about that if you like ?  but about changing it to "" semantic n effects "" ,  which I thought was a little bit too order - biased  and "" semantic bindings "" ,  which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings .  And so it was an issue whether constraints um , there were some linguists who reacted against "" constraints "" , saying , "" oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it shouldn't be called a constraint "" .  But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ?  Cuz there are I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for  actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes .  Yeah , yeah .  It 's used shouldn't matter , right ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , uh , there was one time when when Hans explained why "" constraints "" was a misleading word for him .  And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term ,  which was just an interesting coincidence .  Um , but , uh  And so I was like , "" OK , well both of you don't like it ?  Fine , we can change it "" .  But I I I 'm starting to like it again .  So that that 's why That 's why I 'll stick with it .  So  What ?  Con - uh , a consequent ?  Yeah , but it 's not an "" if - then "" .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , that 's true .  Oh , oops !  No . That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with it .  So , I 'm sorry .  I didn't mean that one 's an in unintentional .  Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent  cuz I 'm not sure yet .  Here , I actually it was just a mistake .  Yeah .  Well , unless I go with "" meaning ""  but i I mean , I kind of like "" meaning "" better than "" semantic ""  ","OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings .

Bed015.F,"but I think there 's vestiges of other people 's biases .  Like  Minor point .  OK , um ,  so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block .  And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types .  Oh , one thing I should mention is about "" designates "" .  I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well .  So , um , strike out the M subscript on the middle block .  So basically now , um , this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change ,  which is that "" designates "" isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now .  So we want s "" designates "" to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects  but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on .  So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , "" are you of type is this part of type whatever "" , um , the "" designates "" tells you which sort of part is the meaning part .  OK , so if you have like "" the big red ball "" , you know , you wanna know if there 's an object or a noun .  Well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase .  Um ,  there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um to talk about there also being a designated object  and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ?  So the ball is the head of the phrase ,  "" the r the "" , um , "" big red ball "" ,  and the entity denoted by the word "" ball "" is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element .  Mm - hmm .  Right , right .  And , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision .  So that 's a useful thing  so that you can get some internal structural constraints in .  Um , there was a list of things that isn't included  but you you can you can ask a question .  That might @ @ it .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Well , except for their construction meaning ,  ","so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block .

Bed015.F,"so it 's not clear that ,  uh  Well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type .  So I don't know what a form type is .  Yeah .  Right .  A well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it .  So you could say "" construct of type whatever designates something "" .  But that was mostly for reference purposes ,  just to refer to the meaning pole .  I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning ,  which is really what we want most of the time I think .  Um ,  I I don't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h  if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know that 's kind of weird .

So one option that , you know , Keith had mentioned also was like , well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations ,  those could intersect with these  in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions .  And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way .  But you know , for now , I mean ,  uh , you know .  M moving it to another place , right .

","So there 's going to be some extra you know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now .  so something like "" past "" which i you know , we think is a very simple uh , we 've often just stuck it in as a feature ,  Um , it 's often thought of as it is also considered a mental space ,  whereas past is a very conventionalized one  Oh , oh , oh , oh , instead of just time ?  Same thing .  So there are very conventionalized like deictic ones , right ?  ","Similarly, ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top. "
Bed015.F,"There 's a sort of there 's a slot for setting time and setting place .  And  you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place ,  and then there are many in more interestingly , linguistically anyway , there are relative things that , you know , you relate the event in time and space to where you are now .  If there 's something a lot more complicated like , or so hypothetical or whatever , then you have to do your job ,  like or somebody 's job anyway .  I 'm gonna point to at random .  Mm - hmm .  They 're real , right .  I see right .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  It seems like , um , the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals , whatever , give you sort of the the most basi  th those we I think we can figure out what the possibilities are , right ?  There are sort of a relatively limited number .  And then how they interact with some extra thing like "" in France "" or "" if such - and - such "" , that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can  You know , one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you .  I think .  But , you know , whatever ,  we we 're  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  That 's OK .  We usually don't know the point of the sentence at all .  But we know what it 's trying to say .  We we know that it 's what predication it 's setting up .  That 's all .  Purely linguistic cues , right ?  So .  Mmm .  OK , so , um , one other thing I just want to point out is there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like "" profile , designate , focus "" , et cetera , et cetera .  Um , for now I 'm gonna say like "" profile "" 's often used  like two uses that come to mind immediately .  One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else .  So "" hypotenuse "" , you profiled this guy against the background of the right t right triangle .  OK .  And the second use , um , is in FrameNet. It 's  slightly different .  Oh , I was asking Hans about this .  They use it to really mean , um , this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required .  So they have to be there or expressed in some way .  Which which I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive  but they 're they 're different meanings .  ","OK , so , um , one other thing I just want to point out is there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like "" profile , designate , focus "" , et cetera , et cetera .

Bed015.F,"So the closest thing  so I was thinking about how it relates to this notation .  For us , um  OK , so how is it  so "" designate "" FrameNet ?  FrameNet ?  Yeah , yeah .  I I mean , I I was a little bit surprised about it too .  I knew that  I thought that that would be something like  there 's another term that I 've heard for that thing  but they I mean uh , well , at least Hans says they use it that way .  And  and may maybe he 's wrong .  Anyway , so  I think the the "" designate "" that we have in terms of meaning is really the "" highlight this thing with respect to everything else "" . OK ?  So this is what what it means .  But the second one seems to be useful  but we might not need a notation for it ?  We don't have a notation for it  but we might want one .  So for example we 've talked about if you 're talking about the lexical item "" walk "" ,  you know it 's an action .  Well , it also has this idea it carries along with it the idea of an actor  or somebody 's gonna do the walking .  Or if you talk about an adjective "" red "" , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red .  So we used to use the notation "" with "" for this  and I think that 's closest to their second one .  So I d don't yet know , I have no commitment , as to whether we need it .  It might be  it 's the kind of thing that w a parser might want to think about whether we require  you know , these things are like it 's semantically part of it  Right .  Right , right . Yeah , um , definitely .  So , um ,  "" in "" was a good example .  If you walk "" in "" , like well , in what ?  You know , like you have to have the So so it 's only semantically is it  it is still required , say , by simulation time though  to have something .  So it 's that I meant the idea of like that the semantic value is filled in by sim simulation .  I don't know if that 's something we need to spa to to like say ever as part of the requirement ?  or the construction ?  or not .  We 'll we 'll again defer .  Have it construed ,  is that the idea ?  Just point at Robert .  Whenever I 'm confused just point to him .  You tell me .  OK .  OK , well we 'll get , uh uh , I we have thoughts about those as well .  Um ,  the I w I would just  ","I think the the "" designate "" that we have in terms of meaning is really the "" highlight this thing with respect to everything else "" . OK ?  But the second one seems to be useful  So I d don't yet know , I have no commitment , as to whether we need it .  ",
Bed015.F,"s some of this is just like my you know , by fiat .  I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms .  I don't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it .  I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress .  So , s  I think that the way I we would like to think , uh , I think is focus is something that comes up in , I mean , lots of  basically this is the information structure .  OK , it 's like uh , it 's not it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus  or that there are things like , you know ,  I think Keith was telling me , things toward the end of the sentence , post - verbal , tend to be the focused focused element ,  the new information .  You know , if I "" I walked into the room "" , you tend to think that , whatever , "" into the room "" is sort of like the more focused kind of thing .  And when you , uh , uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element is kind of related to information structure .  So that 's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing .  Uh , so so I think that 's kind of nice to keep "" focus "" being an information structure term .  "" Stress ""  I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it .  So , um , like "" stress "" , th stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress .  And that 's just a  uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device .  You know , like , oh , high volume or whatever .  Um ,  t uh , and distinguish that from it 's effect  which is , "" Oh , the kind of focus we have is we 're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values "" , right ?  So focus carries along a scope .  Like if you 're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't .  Um , so my classic my now - classic example of saying , "" Oh , he did go to the meeting ? "" ,  that was my way of saying as opposed to , you know , "" Oh , he didn't g "" or "" There was a meeting ? ""  ","I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress .  OK , it 's like uh , it 's not it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus  Uh , so so I think that 's kind of nice to keep "" focus "" being an information structure term .  uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device .  You know , like , oh , high volume or whatever .  Like if you 're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't .  ",
Bed015.F,"I think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately .  And so , um , the like if you said he  you know , there 's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're , c focusing , whatever , on , uh  "" he walked to the meeting "" as opposed to "" he ran "" ,  or "" he did walk to the meeting "" as opposed to "" he didn't walk "" . You know ,  so we need to have a notation for that  which , um ,  I think that 's still in progress .  So , sort of I 'm still working it out .  But it did one one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that I couldn't think of a good way to say "" here are the possible things that you could focus on "" ,  cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus .  But I think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus , right ?  So for instance , you could say it 's the the tense on this as opposed to , um , the the action . OK .  Or it 's uh , it 's an identity thing or a contrast with other things ,  or stress this value as opposed to other things .  So , um ,  it 's it is kind of like a profile profile - background thing  but I I can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would that you would focu  light highlight  as opposed to other ones .  So it has some certain complications for the , uh , uh later on .  Li - I mean , uh , the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements .  For instance , you Oh , one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements  and that 's probably relevant for the like "" where is "" , you know , "" the castle "" kind of thing ?  Because you might want to say that , um , location or cert certain WH words bring you know , sort of automatically focus in a , you know , "" I don't know the identity of this thing "" kind of way on certain elements .  So .  OK . Anyway . So that 's onl there are there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation  but it 's most I think it 's this is , you know , the current current form .  ","so we need to have a notation for that  I think that 's still in progress .

Bed015.F,"Other things we didn't totally deal with , um ,  well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that Keith and I have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective .  You know , a a nominal expression .  And , um ,  I mean , we should have put an example of this  and we could do that later .  But I think the not inherently like the general principles still work though ,  that , um , we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like , you know , for instance , one  Uh , you know , they they have constituents , right ?  So you can like nest things when you need to ,  but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way .  So if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience , then like this this might , you know , be a little o opaque .  But , you know , we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent - based grammar .

Or the constituent that it falls in .  You mean t forget about stress , the form cue ?  OK .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  I believe you , yeah .  Mm - hmm .

Well , uh , yeah , I wouldn't have assumed that it 's an easy problem in in absence of all the oth  you need all the other information I guess .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .  Yeah . Exactly . So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture .  W uh ,  I 'm not sure about that .  Or it might limit it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus .  I think that 's that 's , th that 's certainly true .  And depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus , right ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Is on .  "" John is on the bus "" .  Yeah . Yeah .  Right .

Bed015.F,"the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions .  So that 's why I was talking about overlapping constructions .  So , then you have a separate thing that picks out , you know , stress on something relative to everything else .  And it would  yeah ,  and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that .  But it 's still is limited possibility .  So that should , you know , interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there .  Mm - hmm .  Well , so that 's why I was saying how  since I couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it , um , all I can say is that information structure has a focused slot  and I think that should be able to refer to  Yeah ,  and , infer and I don't have I don't have a great way or great examples  but I think that something like that is probably gonna be , uh , more more what we have to do .  But , um ,  OK , that was one comment .  And you had another one ?  How about what ?  Yeah , so that was the other thing .  And so I didn't realize it before .  It 's like , "" oh ! "" It was an epiphany that it you know , topic and focus are a contrast set .  So topic is  Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK ,  or a landmark trajector , or some something like that .  There 's there 's definitely , um , that kind of thing going on .  Now I don't know whether  I n I don't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions  on like focus , right ?  Um , topic it seems kind of you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing .  Topic marker ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  So again , information structure has a topic slot .  And , you know , I stuck it in thinking that we might use it .  Um , I think I stuck it in .  Um , and  one thing that I didn't do consistently , um , is when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role .  I think I have an idea of what it should be  but th  you know , so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or , um , you know , whatever .  I forg it 'll be a frame .

Bed015.F,"You know , it 'll be it 'll be another predication or it 'll be , um , I don't know , some value from from some something , some variable and scope or something like that ,  or a slot chain based on a variable and scope .  OK , so well that 's  should we flip over to the other side officially then ?  I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it .  Yeah .  Now we 'll go back to s  OK , so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it ,  which is , um , the discourse situation context record ,  right ? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line  and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on .  And sort of this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this .  But for instance you could imagine instead of having  I I changed the name of um it used to be "" entities "" .  So you see it 's "" scenario "" , "" referent "" and "" discourse segment "" .  And "" scenario "" is essentially what kind of what 's the basic predication ,  what event happened .  And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ?  Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here ,  general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f  you know , specific X - schema frames .  OK , whatever .  The middle thing used to be "" entities ""  because you could imagine it should be like really a list  where here was various information .  And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about .  So "" Harry walked into the room "" ,  "" Harry "" and "" room "" ,  you know , the room  th but they would be represented in this list somehow .  And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot .  Um , it should be either category or in or instance .  Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology .  So that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in .  But the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number , gender ,  um ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary  but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth  if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening ,  linear time , linear spaces ,  like , you know , are are they doing something serially  ","You know , it 'll be it 'll be another predication or it 'll be , um , I don't know , some value from from some something , some variable and scope or something like that ,  or a slot chain based on a variable and scope .

Each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance. "
Bed015.F,"or is it like ,  um , uh I 'm I 'm not sure .  Because this partly came from , uh , Talmy 's schema  and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually .  But  Um , and then the "" status "" I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status .  So , th the the big com and and finally "" discourse segment "" is about sort of speech - act - y information structure - y ,  like utterance - specific kinds of things .  So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity the entity 's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse  like situation context ,  you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to .  And you might that might be sort of a general , I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to .  And I changed to "" reference ""  cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it .  And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here .  For instance , I know it 's going to be plural .  I know it 's gonna be feminine or something like that .  And and these could actually just point to , you know , the the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ?  So , um ,  uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about .  I almost listed "" discourse status "" as a slot where you could say it 's active .  You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible .  It was the one that , you know , Keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us ,  not all of us .  And  the thing is that that I noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent .  It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been ,  or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active .  So .  Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there  but actually that 's a property of the situation .  And it 's again , time , you know at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you  and  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  So some of these are , uh  Right .

Bed015.F,"So I so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ?  Everything else here is utterance - specific .  Um , and I left the slot , "" predications "" , open  because you can have , um , things like "" the guy I know from school "" .  Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make .  And it 's unclear whether  I mean , you could just have in your scenario , "" here are some extra few things that are true "" , right ?  And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ?  You 're but but it 's used for identification purposes .  So it 's it 's a little bit different from just saying "" all these things are true from my utterance "" .  Um .  Yeah , it 's a little bit it 's a little bit different .  Right ? So  Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive  you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for  um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence .  So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know in identifying a particular referent would be , "" oh , some "" you know , "" it 's a guy  and it 's someone I know from school "" .  So maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find you know , either create this reference ,  in which case it 'd be created here ,  and  you know , so so you could imagine that this might not  So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things .  Um .  Um , it could be in  semantically , yeah . Yeah .  So it uh , uh , a table .  You know , a thing that c doesn't have a gender .  So . Uh , it could be that I mean ,  maybe you 'd maybe not all these  I mean , I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things .  Yeah .

Bed015.F,"So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should I just go through each of these slots uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ?  Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic .  And just a note ,  which was that , um  s so when we actually ha  so for instance , um ,  some of them seem more inherently static , OK ,  like a container or sort of support - ish .  And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic  like "" source , path , goal "" is often thought of that way  or "" force "" , or something like that .  But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that .  And different X - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic .  So "" path "" , you could just be talking about the path between this and this .  And you know , "" container "" that you can go in and out .  All of these things .

Bed015.F,"Um , and so one nice thing that , uh , we had talked about is this example of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know definitely , it is one way to for you to , you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object .  And so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ?  Well , maybe there are other things .  You know , now that it 's subject is more like a topic .

Um ,  some of these other ones ,  let 's see .  So ,  uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts .  So polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance .  So by default it 'll be like "" true "" , I guess ,  you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen .  You could imagine that you skip out this you know , leave off this polarity ,  you know , not don't have it here .  And then have it part of the speech - act in some way .  There 's some negation .  But the reason why I left it in is cuz you might have a change of state , let 's say , where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold ,  and you 're just talking , you know  if you 're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that , you know , whatever , the holder doesn't and  OK , it 's so it 's it 's it 's fine where it is .

It 's a grab bag of  Except for "" cause "" , that I forgot .  ",
Bed015.F,"These are all so far these structures , especially from "" path "" and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots .  Now with "" cause "" , uh , the fillers will actually be themselves frames . Right ?  So you 'll say , "" event one causes event B  uh , event two "" ,  and  Yeah . So that 's , uh these are all implicitly one within , uh within one world .  Um ,  even though saying that place takes place , whatever .  Uh , if y if I said "" time "" is , you know , "" past "" , that would say "" set that this world "" , you know , "" somewhere , before the world that corresponds to our current speech time "" .  So . But that that that 's sort of OK .  The the within the event it 's st it 's still one world .  Um .  Yeah , so "" cause "" and  Other frames that could come in I mean , unfortunately you could bring in say for instance , um , uh , "" desire "" or something like that ,  like "" want "" .  And actually there is right now under "" discourse segments "" , um , "" attitude "" ?  "" Volition "" ?  could fill that .  So there are a couple things where I like , "" oh , I 'm not sure if I wanted to have it there  or "" Basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed .  And , like , well , I don't you know , it was like "" hope , wish . desire "" ,  blah - blah - blah .  And it 's like , well , I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning  I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place .  So They 're more lexically marked , right ?  At least in English .  So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying ,  e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ?  You know , like "" Naomi wants wants su a certain situation  and that situation itself is a state of affairs "" .  u  Can be just another frame that 's part of your  Yeah .  Situation . Right , right .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Exactly .  Yeah .  Right .  Right , right .  S so I would prefer not to worry about that for right now  and to think that there are , um ,  discourse level constructions in a sense , topic topic - focus constructions that would say , "" oh , when you focus something "" then  ","Yeah . So that 's , uh these are all implicitly one within , uh within one world .  or "" Basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed .  I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place .  ",
Bed015.F,"just done the same way just actually in the same way as the lower level .  If you stressed , you know , "" John went to the "" , you know , "" the bar "" whatever , you 're focusing that  and a in a possible inference is "" in contrast to other things "" .  So similarly for a whole sentence , you know , "" in France such - and - such happens "" .  So the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible .  I mean  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  So for a particular segment it 's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation , right ?  So for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me .  Um , hearer is a little bit harder .  It could be like multiple people .  I guess that that that that 's not very clear from here  I mean , that 's not allowed here .  Mm - hmm .  Ye - yeah .  So th  Right , so the constructions might of course will refer , using pronouns or whatever .  In which case they have to check to see , uh , who the , uh , speaker in here wa in order to resolve those .  But when you actually say that "" he walked into "" , whatever , um , the "" he "" will refer to a particular  You you will already have figured who "" he "" or "" you "" , mmm , or "" I "" , maybe is a bett better example , who "" I "" refers to .  Um , and then you 'd just be able to refer to Harry , you know , in wherever that person whatever role that person was playing in the event .  Yeah , yeah .  S so , that 's I think that 's just  n  for instance , Speaker is known from the situation , right ?  You 're when you hear something you 're told who the speaker is  I mean , you know who the speaker is .  In fact , that 's kind of constraining how  in some ways you know this before you get to the you fill in all the rest of it .  I think .  I mean , how else would you um  Yeah .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right , right .  So  S so OK , so I would say ref under referent should be something that corresponds to "" I "" .  And maybe each referent should probably have a list of way whatever , the way it was referred to .  So that 's "" I ""  but , uh , uh , should we say it it refers to , what ?  Uh , if it were "" Harry "" it would refer to like some ontology thing .  ","If you stressed , you know , "" John went to the "" , you know , "" the bar "" whatever , you 're focusing that  and a in a possible inference is "" in contrast to other things "" .

Bed015.F,"If it were if it 's "" I "" it would refer to the current speaker ,  OK , which is given to be like , you know , whoever it is .  "" I "" within the current world .  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So this entire thing is inside a world ,  not just like the top part .  That 's  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  So I thought of having like for each referent , having the list of of the things t with which it is identified .  You know , which which , uh you know , you you you  for instance , um  So , I guess ,  it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing .  If it 's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever .  If it 's an old thing it could be referring to , um , usually w something in a situation , right ?

So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week .  OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general .  So  um , uh what 's uh Sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects ,  um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them .  So there 's some international standards  like the I - triple - E , uh There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard ,  and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on .  Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting .  One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document ,  and one is uh , you have sort of a , um ,  well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of of the of the units .  Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy ,  because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that  is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used ,  and uh ,  I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems  ","OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general .  um , uh what 's uh Sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects ,  um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them .  So there 's some international standards  because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that  is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used ,  ",
Bed017.C,"and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that  and uh As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes ,  which are very , very coarse grain ,  so you have some like , science , biology , and then  But that 's really all that we have at the moment .  So I think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there .  Now , what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world .  But we can't really  Um , so what I 'm what I try to do is um , to have um ,  uh So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem .  Now , what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example ,  they always run into the same problems ,  uh , and they always come running to us ,  and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working ,  and we always give out the same answer ,  so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this ,  and so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system .  Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information  which is more elaborate than "" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . ""  So .  And I think that I don't need to tell you this .  I 'm I 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context  it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference .  So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school ,  um , what kind of software is the person using ,  which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment ,  um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's  um , which um , which error message was encountered .  So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved .  Now ,  um ,  basically giving this um Uh  so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically ,  ","and uh As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes ,  and so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system .

The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results, if they take into account contextual parameters (user, situation). "
Bed017.C,"and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again .  And , using this and some some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some some simple inferences .  Like you know that when somebody 's working about uh , working on on servlets for example ,  he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used are written in Java .  So some some inferences like that ,  now , um , u using this you can infer more information ,  and you could then match this to the meta - data of um off the documents you 're you 're searching against .  So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs ,  and then I can compute how many documents match ,  and use this as a metric in the search .  Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results ,  and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach .  So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ?  And and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that ,  and find out which um which questions are worth um , asking .  And that 's what I then propagate back to the user ,  and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way .  Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain ,  but the problem is obviously the scalability .  And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network ,  which does exactly this ,  but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend .  And so , uh what I 'm What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources ,  and and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with .  Trying to to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules ,  um , what you can do with those .  Um .  What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this  because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure ,  so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model .  That that probably isn't expressive enough .  ","now , um , u using this you can infer more information ,  and you could then match this to the meta - data of um off the documents you 're you 're searching against .  Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results ,  Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain ,  but the problem is obviously the scalability .  What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this  so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model .  ","The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results, if they take into account contextual parameters (user, situation). "
Bed017.C,"So . So that 's another thing ,  um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now .  And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be  now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results .  So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines .  And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach ,  where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves ,  and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area ,  rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine .  So these are some of the just in a nutshell , some of the ideas .  And I think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are are fairly similar .  So .  OK .  Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Yeah , so . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert  Uh , I want to build a smart librarian , basically  that can point you to the right reference .  I don't wanna compute the answer ,  so it 's a little bit easier for me .  Mm - hmm .  I I assume that that the there will be learning systems that that tag their their content .  And um , um ,  m @ @ and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies .  So "" this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux "" or something like this .  So . So something something very specific that you can then  But the I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries .  You can have the best learning system with the best search interface ,  if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful .  So I think ultimately because um , uh developing these these rules and these inference uh inferences I think is very costly ,  ","And I think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are are fairly similar .

Bed017.C,"so um , uh I think you must be able to reuse some some existing um , domain domain information , or or or ontologies that that uh other people wrote  and then try to integrate them ,  and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small uh , content management system .  So I think that 's that 's crucial for for the success of or @ @  Mm - hmm .  No .  No .  Um , yeah .  Uh , not not too much ,  but uh ,  I have a rough overview .  Mmm . Mmm .  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah .

And so  this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that .  And  So I tried to construct the dependency models ,  and  a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net ,  and what they depend on ,  and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that ,  so I tried to see how I can do , um put in the computational nodes in between .  And what that would look like in a PRM .  And so I ended up making several classes  Actually , you know , a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes ,  and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility .

","An alternative representation of the Bayes-net, it depicts context features as classes, and dependencies as relations between them. "
Bed017.D,"but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is  versus , you know , what type of an event it is ,  or you know , which form of transportation the user has  and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case .  And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM ,  because , um , then you have one - user objects  and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind .  And so  for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility .  And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites ,  and that makes a  I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that .  And so ,  I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net ,  cuz otherwise you would c  well , it 's probably the same .  But um ,  No , you would definitely have  be able to re - use , like , um , all the user stuff ,  and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff ,  because it 's all from the user side .  So if you changed sites , you you can , you know , save some work on that .  But ,  you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help .  Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes .  And that would basically it 's just another class in the model ,  with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time .  And then , after you group them together this  no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this .  And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all .

So that was pretty quick .  She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it  that uh , probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them .  Um ,  so  the You you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation .  OK .

So w Anyway . So that 's a a major open issue .  If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run  and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems ,  to actually take the data , and do it .

I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net ,  uh , without going to some incredible hacking  of sort of rebuilding it on the fly .  I mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net .

Bed017.F,"i it looked to me like if Eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing ,  that a travel planner should be able to take it from there .  And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever ,  and then plan a route .  Yeah .

Um , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services  and Jane has been working on doing transcription .  and then get an update on the electronics ,  Um , you know , eventually we 're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing  I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before .  And and so how we do we distribute the transcripts ,  how do we distribute the audio files ,  but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC  So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are .  And if U d UW 's going to do the same thing I think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well .

Bmr003.A,"And so they 're applying , I think I B  Is that right ?  Something like that .  Um , for some more money to do more data .  So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings .  They wanna do an additional hundred or so hours .  So , they want a very large data set .  Um , but of course we 're not gonna do that if we don't get money .  So .  And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room .  I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well ,  the the acoustics of this room .  Including the fan .  Oh , it 's enormous .  All the others have been on .  y Absolut  Yeah .  There 's definitely  Yep .  High pitch hum .  Wow .  Yeah ,  just get a variety .  They 're very good .  Carbon monoxide poisoning ?  So  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I I wish  I wish we had someone here working on adaptation  because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting .  You know  No ,  software ,  to adapt the speech recognition .  Mm - hmm .  That 's true .  Well that 's not good , right ?  Just these .  Well we can look into it .  So we can get that just with , uh , media costs ,  is that right ?  Oh .  Great .  So that would be yeah , that would be something to look into .  So .  Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it ,  so maybe we need to think about it a little bit .  Yeah .  OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ?  Right .  Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked .  A meeting meeting meeting .  Well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting .  So .  Um .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the U - dub to see  you know , say "" this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription "" , if nothing else .  So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ?  OK ,  so since that 's what we 're talking about .

So all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it ,  and identify the speaker .  And so the things we that we know that I know I want are the text , the start and end , and the speaker .  But other people are interested in for example stress marking .  And so Jane is doing primary stress , um , stress marks as well .

And apparently that 's happened in the past .  And I think that 's probably the right way to do it .  Um , it will require a post pass ,  I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly ,  but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one .  And the commercial ones I 'm sure will be much more expensive .  Yeah right .  We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything .  But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money  and , uh ,  duh , again o  I meant Joy .  And so again , I have to say "" are we recording ""  and then say , uh , Morgan has has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have .  So .  Well , if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription .  I mean , cuz we 're we  I mean , I I can't imagine us doing it ourselves .  Right ?  N right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .

Bmr003.A,"So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students ,  at is that right ?  Talking to people about that ?  OK .  Yeah , right .  So , uh  She 's already done quite a bit .  Yeah .  No .  We 've we 've thought about doing that  but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous .  Most of those are done by a person .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , we  I mean , we 've talked about it  but  We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances .  Yeah ,  so so what what she 's done so far , is sort of more or less breath g not breath groups , sort of phrases , continuous phrases .  And so , um , that 's nice because you you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end .  So that seems to work really well .  Um .  Hmm .  We could program that pretty easily ,  couldn't we Dan ?  Yeah , mis Mister TCL ?  But , um  But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID .  I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change .  But that would be  Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it .  But  We 're gonna need we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to to do all this anyway .  I knew you were gonna do that .  Just saw it coming .  Mm - hmm .  She 's she 's done about half a meeting .  Right ?  About half ?  Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to  I mean that 's easy enough .  I could do that .  No , no .  I mean , that that 's easy enough .  I could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words , and time yourself on it .  So .  Yep .  So it that might be worth doing .  That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations .  Right .  Yep .  That  That 'll s  it might save ninety percent of the work though .  So .  Yeah .  I 've already become pretty familiar with the format ,  so  it would be easy .  If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ?  Mm - hmm .  It 's pretty cute .  But at any rate .  So , um ,  Right .  So so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard .

Bmr003.A,"Everyone more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription .  Using using stone age tools .  I mean , I looked at Cyber Transcriber  which is a service that you send an audio file ,  they do a first - pass speech recognition .  And then they they do a clean up .  But it 's gonna be horrible .  They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this .  Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price .  They want you to call and and talk .  So for other services , um , they were about thirty dollars an hour .  Thirty  So , yeah .  For thirty dollars an hour for of their work .  So so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour .  No .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  so so my my search was pretty cursory .  It was just a net search .  And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that .  Right .  Trivial .  They had two speakers over the telephone .  Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time .  So they were doing phone and syllable transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription .  And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that .  Yep .  Right .  And so so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour .  I think that 's the ball park .  There were several different companies that and the the range was very tight for technical documents .  Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour .  They won't .  We 'll have to mix them .  Yes , it is .  Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on .  None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID , or speaker change mark .  They all just said transcription .  Well , the the way it worked is it it was scaled .  So what they had is , if it 's an easy task it costs twenty - four dollars an hour  and it will take maybe five or six times real time .  And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour  and it takes about ten times real time .  So I think that we can count on that being about what they would do .  It would probably be a little more  because we 're gonna want them to do speaker marking .  So .

Bmr003.A,"But at any rate , so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out .  Thirty or forty .  Three hundred dollars an hour .  Right .  Right ,  these are linguistics grad students .  Six .  Mm - hmm .  I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper .  And also we would have control of I mean , we could give them feedback .  Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount .  I mean , we can't tell them , you know , "" for this meeting we really wanna mark stress  and for this meeting we want ""  And and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress ,  they 're not gonna re provide repairs ,  they 're not gonna provide  they they may or may not provide speaker ID .  So that we would have to do our own tools to do that .  So  I just  I hope it 's Jane .  Is that alright ?  Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved  but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it .  Well , I would like you to do it  because you have a lot more experience than I do ,  but if if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor .  Yeah , six dollars an hour .  OK .  More .  Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ?  Um , the user interface only allows two .  And so if if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two .  But my script can handle any .  And their save format can handle any .  And so , um , using this the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want .  Yeah ,  French .  Yeah .  And they 're they 've been quite responsive .  I 've been exchanging emails on various issues .  Yes ,  and they said that 's on in in the works for the next version .  Multichannels was also  Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels .  So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen .  For this exact task ?  I think they 're linguists .  It 's also All the source is available .  So .  If you if you speak TCLTK .  And they have they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development  and I said , well , maybe .

It was tentatively decided that the latter option would be less costly and allow BMR to maintain greater control over the transcription process. 
Bmr003.A,"Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog  So I mean , tho those are things we could do  but  I I just don't know how much it 's worth doing .  I mean we 're just gonna have  Hmm .  Point ,  whatever .  Non - canonical .  Comments .  Well , I think what w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech ,  right ?  Yep .  Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark .  Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end .  Huge amounts .  Um , when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things .  But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap  but it it 's marked pretty clearly .  Um , some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some comments  and but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting .  And so I think that that often often you can't tell .  I mean , Jane had had comments like uh , to who who the person was speaking to .  Yeah .  Yeah , but someone who , uh , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that .  Or when Dan said , "" I wa I wasn't talking to you "" .  You have to turn off your mike .  Mm - hmm .  But  but when you w when you listen to it  Well what what it what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total totally impolite .  Um  But but if you knew that that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it it became OK .  So .  Yes .  Right .  Stereo .  Yeah .  Oh .  I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other .  I have a auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal  and that seems to work really well for the uh transcribers .  I I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end .  We should probably mark areas that have no speakers as no speaker .  Then , so question mark colon is fine for that .  Just say silence .  No one 's talking .  Yep .  Well , I wanna leave the marked  I don't want them to be part of another utterance .

It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two .  Yep .  Yep .  Yep .  Yep .  Oh .  So  Especially for meetings .  I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know ,  if you were trying to do a remembrance agent .  But I think for meetings it 's probably alright .

What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ?  Well the there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered .

And then there 's the issue of it 's easier to hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of somewhere in the middle ,  cuz then the word 's bisected or whatever  and  And  so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take .  No , it doesn't  but what a super tool .  It 's a great environment .  That 's an interesting idea .  Hey !  That 's interesting .  Yeah ,  I  That 'd be fun .  No ,  uh the the boundary  boundary .  That 's ideal .  Although I was I you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , recently was , um that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time i t pre - marked  cuz it does take time to put those markings in .  It 's really the i the interface is wonderful  because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , and then you press the return key .  But then , you know , it 's like , uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary .  But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key  so it 's slightly delayed ,  so then you you listen to it a second time and move it over to here .  So that takes time .  Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , l you know , good  Yeah .  Yeah ,  uh , not in this case .  It has other  Oh , interesting point .  Ah ! Interesting point .

Bmr003.E,"OK , that would make a difference .  I mean , it 's not bad  but it does take twice .  Oh , good point !  Ah !  We 've got volume .  Wow .  But but it op  I 'm sorry .  I wish you had told me  wish you 'd told me .  At what part ?  OK ,  I 'm alright .  Could you get it so that with so it would it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ?

Well , uh but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate  uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time ,  so uh , it 's gonna be an upper bound in in that case .  And it 's not really strictly comparable .  So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting .

Bmr003.E,"and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into  So , I when I i the it 's quickest for me in terms of the transcription part to say something like , you know , if if Adam spoke to , um to just say , "" A colon "" ,  Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line .  and E colon instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID .  So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID .  If that 's clear .  It 's Perl script .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  That 's right .

Bmr003.E,"So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions .  He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement .  The the It 's a good suggestion .  So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now .  And so my next plan would be  They 're very minimal .  So , it would be good to just to summarize that .  So , um , one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change ,  and this is a way which meshes well with with , uh , making it so that , uh , you know , on the At the  Boy , it 's such a nice interface .  When you when you get the , um you you get the speech signal you also get down beneath it , an indication of , uh ,  if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment , you see them one displayed one above each other .  And then at the same time the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing .  You can clip click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you .  And you can , eh you can work pretty well between those two these two things .  Oh .  Ho  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I do too .  Pre - lay .  Well , and they 've thought about things .  You know , I mean , they they do have  So you have when you when you play it back , um , it 's it is useful to have , uh , a a break mark to se segment it .  But it wouldn't be strictly necessary  cuz you can use the uh , the tabbed key to toggle the sound on and off .  I mean , it 'll stop the s speech you know if you if you press a tab .  And , um .  And so ,  uh , that 's a nice feature .  And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit .  You could do it like multiply  until you get crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit .  Or or  or  Why , that 's  That 's not something I wanted to have happen .  I see .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Yeah ,  I I agree .  They they have several options .  So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option .  Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary .  And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab  and it goes on to the next unit .  I mean , it 's very nicely thought out .

The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who  but but this was unusual circum circumstance .  Well and part of it was funny , uh reason was because it was a mixed signal  so you couldn't get any clues from volume that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation .  You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case .  That 's a good idea .

Yeah , we we 've only had three .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Um  Right .  Yep .  Yeah . Yeah , just talking about .  We all had the same thought .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I think that , um I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English .  And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills .  Right .  Right .  Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one .  So .  What 's that ?  Well , age - ist . The "" eighteen "" is because of the consent form .  We 'd hafta get find their parent to sign for them .  So .  I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that .  We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .  Yep .  Right .  Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS .  You know , to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult .  That 's true .  True .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Yep .  Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .  another type of meeting .  Hmm .  Right .  Yeah , but  I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy .  Right ?  That 's very easy ,  ","Well , I think that , um I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English .  ",
Bmr006.B,"but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting .  And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean .  Ye - Yeah . Yep .  Tape recorder .  Mm - hmm .  Not enough for others , right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  For some of it .  Yep .  Right .  Special ?  Yep .  Yep .  Here .  Yeah , I thought so too .  Well , I was thinking , lunch after .  Yep .  Um , I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered .  Should I pursue that ?  Yeah .  So .  They they originally They 've decided not to do go into speech .  So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer ,  but I 'll send an email and ask .  I 'll tell them about the free lunch .  And they 'll say there 's no such thing .  So .  Right .  That 's alright .  No , the they they 're very weird .  The problem with engineers is "" beep . ""  Yep . Let them have their meeting .  Mmm . Of the meeting ?  It 'd be fun .  I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know .  It 's a novelty item .  Yep .  Oh , yeah .  I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out .  Yeah , that 's right .  That 's a good point .  Right , it can't be the internal one .  That 's right .  Yeah , that 's true .  Yeah .  OK , see you .  No .  Bye .  We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings .  So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving ,  I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from uh , Broadcast News .  and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it .  And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone .  Well , it 's Abbott .  It 's Abbott , so it just But it 's it 's a lot of data .  Tape .  I did an archive .  So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files .  So that will give us ten gigabytes of free space .  And and  Yep .  And so one That that will be done , like , in about two hours .  And so uh , at that point we 'll be able to record five more meetings .  So .  Right .  Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also .  So . And that takes a while .  Two copies .  One offsite , one onsite .  ","And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean .  Um , I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered .  Should I pursue that ?

Bmr006.B,"No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable  um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them . And for the full , uh , hundred forty hour sets .  And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something .  Or maybe six .  The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did .  The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was , you know , fifty percent more .  Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave ,  and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices .  And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors .  "" We "" By "" we "" of course I mean Dave .  So .  SPINE .  Yep .  So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is ,  and that 's probably enough for about four meetings .  So .  Yep .  No , no ,  well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is .  I think it 's DI .  I don't remember .  Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is .  I just don't remember , it might be DC .  And that has enough for about four more meetings right now .  Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand .  Um , someone deleted something somewhere .  And so we have some room again .  And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings ,  so , you know , we have a couple weeks .  Uh , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk .  We should put it onto the Broadcast News one .  That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out .  No .  I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head .  But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it .  Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk .  Yeah .  I 've seen it already .  Yep .  Throughout the meeting .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , you did that by hand ?  Can I see that ?  Can I get a copy ?  Mm - hmm .  Yes , absolutely .  ",Throughout the meeting .  ,

Yeah , we can do whatever we want .  Whatever you 're interested in .  Well  Yep .  Big micro @ @ arrays .  Very finely .  Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array .  And they had very precision .  Right .  It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it .  It was yeah , it was interesting .  But I think  Yep .  That 's on my web pages .  Yeah .

One is , do we need to sign new these again ?  Yep .  Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed .  So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form .  Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing .  But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off .

Bmr006.D,"See what I 'd I 'd Let me tell you what I would do .  I would take just a few features . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple .  OK ?  Like like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it .  and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots .  OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart .

Bmr006.D,"And so , if you can get @ @ Uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect , uh in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier .  And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal .  And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much  And then you can re - optimize , and so on .  Hmm .  That 's well , the It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . Sure .  Hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are uh , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable .  Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess .  Nah .  Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right  that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one  and and so that 's  Uh , well , no , I mean , we we don't have any rules , r really .  I think I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question .  I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one ,  because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two .  Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point .  But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is .  You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much .  So , this is all pretty early stages .  But no , you 're absolutely right .  That 's a good thing to consider .  Well , it it it does , i it d it does , but the the the issue is that that  Yeah , it 's timing difference .

Bmr006.D,"That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , "" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? ""  If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking ,  wherever they are .  Is it a is it  Yeah , is there a narrow Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern ?  So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's it 's uh , multiple people .  Wherever you are , even if he moves around .  Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them ,  but I mean But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page , it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different .  Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation .  Just cross - correlation between two sides .  So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive .  You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags .  OK .  So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag .  So if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function .  It 's spread out .  Yeah .  The - the Oh , I 'm sorry ,  if they 're right next to one another ?  i i  Yeah , e I see .  Yeah . Oh , yeah .  Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's  But it 's almost but it 's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things .  There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue .  So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error .  If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it .  Uh , if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity .  So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .

Bmr006.D,"I mean , the other thing you can do uh , if I mean , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA .  But if you h put a third in , you could put in the other axis . And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah , then then you pretty much could cover  Uh @ @ But - but that 's I mean , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study .

Uh ,  but you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ?  Some people at at uh , yeah , at Brown and and and and at uh um and at Cape ,  they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall .

What ar how are they gonna do any of this ?  I mean , they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker I mean I I  So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words .  Uh Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah .  And it and it may very well be I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two .  And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But that  Well , you do .  Yeah .  If if if if someone says , uh , "" what what is Jose doing ?

Th - Bec  OK , so suppose someone says , "" well I don't know if I really heard what uh , what Jose said . ""  And then , Jose responds .  And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it .  But it doesn't say "" Jose "" , it says "" speaker - five "" .  So uh u  Right .  And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says "" speaker - five "" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose ,  and if were gonna do that we might as well give them "" Jose "" say it was "" Jose "" .  Yeah .  I I agree .  I I agree with Jane .  I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and  Uh .  She  No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said "" Jose "" in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it .

Bmr006.E,"Oh there we go .  This looks good .  Was it a pause , or ?  OK .  Was it on "" pause "" or something ?  OK .  Don't know .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers .  Because I think if you just say  an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that uh , it would be useful for for purposes You know .  But you know , I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus  and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And and the English you 'd have The language models would be really hard to build  because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a  OK .  OK .  Oh , interesting !  Oh , I see .  Oh , interesting !  Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents .  u The accent 's not the problem .  No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency ,  e e just simply fluency .  I mean , I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .  Well , e I just think ,  but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , uh , no problem .  I mean , I 'm not saying accents .  I 'm say I 'm saying fluency .  Well , yeah .  I 'm just saying fluency .  OK , now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective  which is that um , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things  cuz it 's so expensive to put together .  And if people want to approach  Um ,  i so I know e e You know this  The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group ,  but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data ,  ",,
Bmr006.E,"if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in um , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing .  Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  Uh , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case .  If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't uh , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , uh , language model ,  this is the worst case scenario .  And  Well  Oh .  But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that  And I 'm not objecting to accents .  I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a a grammar a grammar , basically , that um , wo would be a a possibility .

By "" speech "" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ?  So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one .  OK .  So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be .  Yeah , that 's right . That 's my question .  Oh !  Like a c  Oh .  So you don't i i it 's not in that  So you 're ignoring overlapping events unless they 're speech with speech .  OK .  We 're just  Yeah .  Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past .  So , this is this is a subset .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah , we just wanted to know what the category was here .  So it 's like a signal - noise situation .  Yeah .  Well , steady state .  Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Can I ask ?

He You mentioned this last time , that that if if you 're straight down the midline , then then the r the left - right 's gonna be different ,  and and and in his case , I mean , he 's closer to it anyway .  It seems to me that that it 's not a p uh , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated .  Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves .  I mean , I know I n I know that 's a very important cue .  But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA ,  so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker .

Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA .  There we go .  Good example , the same one I 'm asking .  Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one .  It seems like that would be pretty strong .

I 'd Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results .  e Could I do that next week maybe ?  OK , that 's what I 'm asking .

I really do think that ,  because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself ,  you and I have discussed it previously ,  and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should  Well , OK .  It 's just  Yeah . OK . I I 'll give you the short version ,  but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes .  OK , so the the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings .  Those we won't be able to change .  If someone says "" Hey , Roger so - and - so "" .  So that 's gonna stay that person 's name .  Now , in terms of like the transcript ,  ",,
Bmr006.E,"the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name ,  and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says "" Hey Roger "" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ?  OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned .  I I don't think you understood what I what I said .  So uh , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says "" So , Roger , what do you think ? ""  OK .  Then , uh , it seems to me that Well , maybe I uh it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that .  OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have "" Roger "" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was "" Roger "" be "" Frank "" , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis .

Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ?  Well , on the one hand , uh , it 's not a full identity ,  we 're taking all these precautions , um and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK .  So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection .  On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name .

S i You know , "" You raised the point , So - and - so "" , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who "" you "" was .  And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names ,  and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial .  Well , I mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse .  Misleading .  OK .  Sure .  Oh , it 's not a problem . Not a problem . Yeah .  I just I just couldn't do it in two minutes .  How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ?  How do you mean ?  They won't be able to change it themselves .  Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them .  Oh . I think that My understanding from Yen  Is it Yen - Ching ?  Is that how you pronounce her name ?  Oh , uh Yu - Ching ?  Yu - Ching ?  was that um , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down .  But , you know , h they won't know these people ,  so I think it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention  but we haven't specified to them  So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what  ","Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication .  Yeah , and and you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just being able to , uh Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important .  ","And, finally, the problem of speaker anonymization was explored. "
Bmr006.E,"I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers .  We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case .  Yeah .  You know  Uh - huh .  You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part .  And and but then we would need to label it .  And that 's OK .  Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes .  That 'd be very efficient .  Mm - hmm .  Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit .  Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh , @ @ uh , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking .  But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name .  So , people are really flexible .  Yeah ?  Well , it  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  That 's that 's the issue .  Well .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI .  And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to .  And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to .  But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how  i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um the audio , and just put in brackets "" speaker - one "" .  You know .  Uh - huh .  I think that 's risky . I think that the public should be the same .  I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same .  For a bunch of reasons , legal .  But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important .

It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved ,  and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio ,  and then you come directly into this confronting this problem .

Bmr006.F,"That 's looks strange .  Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up .  Um , at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data  and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam ,  um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us ,  th the guy that was at the last meeting .  And he 's already funded part - time ,  so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,  uh Yeah .  So  he 's comes from a signal - processing background ,  but I liked him a lot  cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,  so he 's just getting his feet wet in that .  Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with .  But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth .  So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible ,  um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time  Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses ,  both to get the , um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about  things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about .  I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth .  So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns ,  like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech ,  ","um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us ,  he 's comes from a signal - processing background ,  cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,  um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time  So .

So So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough .  But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize ,  but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries .  And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group  because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds .  See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end meeting .  OK .  But maybe that 's enough .

Um no , when when when there 's backchannel , I mean , just I was just listening , and and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like , um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person  and a lot of times , the first person actually stops talking and then there 's a backchannel and then they start up again ,  and so I 'm wondering about h I just wonder how much overlap there is .  Is there a lot ?  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  But maybe a just a small overlap ?  I was just thinking more in terms of alignment , alignment overlap .  Hostile takeovers .  I wonder what determines who gets the floor ?  I mean  Why why do we want to have a picture of the meeting ?  We can can't you figure it out from the mike number ?  OK .  Oh .

I think what 's really interesting though , it is before d saying "" yes , meetings have a lot of overlaps "" is to actually find out how many more we have than two - party .  Cuz in two - party conversations , like Switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ?  it 's also ver it 's huge .  It 's just that people haven't been looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for speech recognition .

Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply ,  so if each of us was calling and having a meeting that way you kn you know like a conference call .  And , just the question is , y you know , in Switchboard you would think that 's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person ,  and I 'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that that Jane described happen with more people present .

I think there 's a lot of the kind that Jose was talking about , where I mean , this is called "" precision timing "" in conversation analysis , where they come in overlapping , but at a point where the information is mostly complete .  So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words .  So technically , it 's an overlap .

I mean , not as well as what I mean , you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously ,  but you 'd get some rough statistics .  So .  I guess my my first comment was , um only that um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings ,  but maybe that 's obvious ,  maybe everybody knew that ,  but that in normal conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap ,  and that it would be interesting to look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned , that what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn ,  you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn ,  but pretty quickly there 're they back off  and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time .  So , I don't know .  To answer your question I it I don't think it 's crucial to have controls  but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we can .  So , um you know .

I mean physically can we record the o the other  That 's what they did on Map Task , you know , this Map Task corpus ?

Well , that 's exactly , exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins in uh Switchboard ,  Well , I was thinking you should be able to do this from the acoustics , on the close - talking mikes ,  I guess my my first comment was , um only that um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings ,  but that in normal conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap ,  and that it would be interesting to look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned , that what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn ,  To answer your question I it I don't think it 's crucial to have controls  but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we can .  ",Efforts by speakers fe008 and fe016 are in progress to categorize and subcategorize types of overlapping speech and evaluate the contribution of multiple speakers in an interaction to the amount and types of overlap observed. 
Bmr007.B,"Yeah , yeah .  But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla like here .  The fashion statement .  But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting ?  I think that 'd be really interesting too , with blindfolds .  Then  Yeah .  The question is , like whether  Well , trying with and with and without , yeah .  But then there 's just one @ @ , like .  Oh , yeah , that 's really common .  It 's very difficult if you try while you 're trying , say , to convince somebody on the phone it 's difficult not to move your hands .  Not You know , if you watch people they 'll actually do these things .  So .  I still think we should try a a meeting or two with the blindfolds ,  at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of  Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting .  That could be fun .  It 'll be too hard to make barriers , I was thinking because they have to go all the way  you know , I can see Chuck even if you put a barrier here .  Y Yeah ?  But then we also have these mikes , is the other thing I was thinking ,  so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb the sound ,  um  I mean , it sounds weird but but you know it 's it 's cheap and , uh Be interesting to have the camera going .  I think the beep is a really good idea .  Also  Notice how quiet I am .  You have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings .  Yeah , definitely .  So I guess if there 's an overlap , like , if I 'm saying something that 's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped , too ?  And , I wanted to say , I think this is really interesting analysis .  I meant to say that before I started off on the Switchboard stuff .  It 's neat .  Yeah .  Does it take  How long does it take , just briefly , like t to OK . to label the ,  OK .  OK .  It 's really neat .  Well , I can wear it , I mean if you  OK .  I feel like this troublemaker .  OK .

That was that was sort of the point .  So , uh I had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda to send it to me and no one did .  So ,  Uh ,  Right ,  s OK , so one item for an agenda is uh Jane has some uh uh some research to talk about , research issues .  Um and Uh , Adam has some short research issues .  Um , I have a list of things that I think were done over the last three months  I was supposed to send off , uh and , um I I sent a note about it to uh to Adam and Jane  but I think I 'll just run through it also and see if someone thinks it 's inaccurate or uh insufficient .  Uh , to uh uh , IBM .  OK .  They 're , you know  So .  Um , So , uh so , I 'll go through that .  Um , And , Anything else ? anyone wants to talk about ?  No .  OK .  Um .  Sort of off - topic I guess .  Cuz that 's Cuz that was all all about the , uh  I I I can chat with you about that off - line .  That 's another thing .  Um , And , Anything else ?  Nothing else ?  Uh , there 's a I mean , there is a a , um uh telephone call tomorrow , which will be a conference call that some of us are involved in for uh a possible proposal .  Um , we 'll talk we 'll talk about it next week if if something  Uh Well , we 'll talk talk about that after our meeting .  OK .  Uh , OK .  So it sounds like the the three main things that we have to talk about are , uh this list , uh Jane and Jane and Adam have some research items , and , other than that , anything , as usual , anything goes beyond that .  OK , uh , Jane , since since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours ,  make sure we get to it .  What was what 's the the parenthesized stuff that says , like e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ?  Mmm .  Ah .  ",,
Bmr007.D,"S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Excuse me .  B I I I rather enjoyed it , but but this  Sure .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh sure .  Well , of course th the biggest , um result here , which is one we 've we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps .

Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm ?  Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more ,  because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice ,  so that so the issue is in in a situation where th that 's  Mm - hmm ?

And , uh you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to sixty seconds .  And , um What you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right , whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers .  And , um and , what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're bursts of them .  Um .  And it looked to me as though  uh , you know y this is just eh eh , this would this is not statistically verified , but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being localized to a particular region .

This is really interesting data .  Mm - hmm .  Though it wasn't in the design .  Right .  Yep .  I could certainly see it going either way .  Um .  Yep , we need to put trackers on it .  Yeah , you don't have it .  Your mike is  That is an earphone , so if you just put it so it 's on your ear .  There you go .  Thank you .  It 'd be interesting if we could do prediction .  Language model prediction of overlap , that would be really interesting .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Let 's pick a different word .  Trying to get the floor .  It 's been studied a lot .  Ach .  Mm - hmm .  Well , but from the acoustic point of view , it 's all good .  Yep .  Well , that 's the that was my my status report ,  so Once we 're done with this stuff discussing ,  Mm - hmm .  Can .  Right .  Yeah , we talked about this repeatedly .  It just seems like that 's a very different thing than what we 're doing .  Barriers !

Bmr007.H,"OK , we can record , but no one can look at each other .  Close your eyes .  Turn off the lights .  Um , what I had thought we were gonna do is just take pictures of the whiteboards . rather than take pictures of the meeting .  And , uh  Seat number , that 's a good idea .  I 'll do that .  I 'll do that on the next set of forms .  I finally remembered to put , uh put native language on the newer forms .  No .  The wireless ones .  And even the jacks , I mean , I 'm sitting here and the jack is over in front of you .  It would be another task .  Having having ground tu truth would be nice , so seat number would be good .  So I 'm gonna put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number .  That 's a good idea .  But , uh  Yep .  Yep .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Of course , the where we sit at the table , I find is very interesting , that we do tend to cong to gravitate to the same place each time .  and it 's somewhat coincidental .  I 'm sitting here so that I can run into the room if the hardware starts , you know , catching fire or something .  I just want to be at the head of the table .  Take control .  Yeah , I 've been playing with , um uh , using the close - talking mike to do to try to figure out who 's speaking .  So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about about two weeks ago ,  and so I played with that a little bit , and it works O K , except that it 's very sensitive to your choice of your filter width and your threshold .  So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not .  But if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it doesn't work anymore ,  even if you normalize it based on the absolute loudness .  It does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting .  Um Pretty well .  Pretty well .  How did I do it ?  What do you mean ?  The algorithm was , uh take o every frame that 's over the threshold , and then median - filter it , and then look for runs .  So there was a minimum run length ,  so that  A threshold that you pick .  Yeah .

Bmr007.H,"and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones .  And then I median - filtered that using , um a fairly long filter length .  Uh well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers .  Um and that 's to average out you know , pitch , you know , the pitch contours , and things like that .  And then , uh looked for long runs .  And that works O K , if you fil if you tune the filter parameters , if you tune how long your median filter is and how high you 're looking for your thresholds .  No .  I certainly could though .  But this was just I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do .  OK and then the other thing I did , was I took Javier 's speaker - change detector acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes ,  and unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's  the problem is he does it in two passes ,  the first pass is to find candidate places to do a break .  And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the the , uh one of the phone classes is silence .  And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends .  And then he has a second pass which is a modeling a Gaussian mixture model .  Um looking for uh whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places .  And what looks like it 's happening is that the even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job .  Uh , I have no idea .  I don't remember .  Does an do you remember , Morgan ,  was it Broadcast News ?  Um So , at any rate , my next attempt , which I 'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the uh , thresholding as the way of generating the candidates .  Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks .  All of which are definitely acoustic events .  They 're definitely someone talking .  But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing .  And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector .  And so I think that might work .  But , I haven't gotten very far on that .

My feeling is that  we discussed this right before coffee  and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set ,  but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them .

It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random ,  and that people might articulate more ,  and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence .

And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format .  And then you have , all these things split across according to channel ,  and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel ,  and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , um , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels ,  ","I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing .

Uh , how how m much  time so the meetings vary in length ,  what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ?  OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  The pre presegment  yeah .  Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ?  OK .  How many minutes would you want from  I mean , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have .  And then ,  should provide this .  Somewhere not in the very beginning , five minutes , OK .  And , then I wanted to ask you just for my inter information ,  then , would you , be trai  cuz I don't quite unders  so , would you be training then , um , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ?  So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , uh , to , providing tighter time bands ?  Wow , interesting .  OK .  Uh - huh .  Excellent .  Excellent , OK .  Wonderful .  OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then  Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ?

Bmr013.C,"But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much .  I don't know .  Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that ,  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  See , I don't know .

Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about ,  but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones .  Uh , he didn't know what to say , about , what is the sequence of phones there .  They came up with some compromise .  Because that really wasn't what it look like .

And someone else , might actually want some phonetic uh intermediate thing .  So I think it would be be best to have all of it if we could .  But um ,  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean this is the kind of reason why  I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that uh when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , "" can't be done "" .  He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones ,  and when you actually look at Switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . And .

But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened .  But .

Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah , so I mean , what , what where this is , I mean , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind ,  so it should be something broader .  But , The but uh where I 'm coming from is , uh , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , um , uh , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , uh , they , uh , have , um , a m a multi - band system that is , uh , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to um , estimate , uh , the , uh , value for m for for a particular feature .

Bmr013.C,"Might not be , you know , exact features that , Jakobson thought of or something .  But I mean you know some , something like that .

You could argue what , what a sound unit should be , and and so forth .  But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing ,  um , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .  You wouldn't necessarily have to .

So I mean that 's probably the right way to go anyway , is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that , that , um , you know , tries , to label it all .  And then , people go through and fix it .  Well , regular dictionary , I mean , this is a pretty rich dictionary .  It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it  Yeah .

Well the prosodics are so much different  s it 's gonna be , strange .  I mean the prosodics are not the same as TI - digits , for example .  So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have .  Um , just what we were talking about with grouping .  That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end .  Aurora I don't know .  I don't know what they do in Aurora .  But Right .  But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that ,  so it 's gonna be different .  I don't remember .  I mean , very good ,  right ?  One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ?  Oh really ?  OK .  Alright .  Right .  But that I mean it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , I mean , every everything is good .  Yes , exactly .  And we 've only recently got it to anywhere near human .  And it 's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do .  So .  Yeah .  After coffee .  OK , so , um , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data .  And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits .  Hmm .  Yeah that 's I I agree .  That it 's just  It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ?  ","I mean the prosodics are not the same as TI - digits , for example .

Bmr013.F,"M I think we can get Ohala in to , give us some advice on that .  Right .  Even , I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard ,  wouldn't it ?  To identify actually , you know , which one it is ?  Yeah .  Uvular .  Right .  Right .  Yeah , so you have this feature here , and , overlap , yeah .  And Or "" gonta "" .  Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though .  But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature .  Right ,  so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here ,  and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones .  Right .  And in in fact the inter - annotator agreement was not that good ,  right ?  On the harder ones ?  The word .  Well  Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous ,  right .  They overlap each other in weird ways .  So it 's not a strictly one - dimensional signal .  So I think that 's sorta qualitatively different .  Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones .  Yeah .  That 's what I was saying ,  maybe meeting data isn't the right corpus .  Alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there .  Right .  Right .  They are .  I wonder , how would you do a forced alignment ?  To to I mean , you 'd wanna iterate , somehow .  Yeah .  It 's interesting thing to think about .  I mean you 'd you 'd want models for spreading .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Oh .  Of course .  Wow that 's great .  So I I understand that 's what you were saying about your problem with , minimum .  I get it .  So new use ninetieth quartile , rather than , minimum .  Well we did the hand  the one by hand .  Uh .  No , cuz we need is really tight .  Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did .  Good .  Yeah , so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea .  Oh , shoot !  Yep .  u  Right .  Right .  An extra channel .

Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , um , and try them out .  And then , if we like them we 'll get more .  Since they 're they 're like two hundred bucks a piece ,  we won't , uh , at least try them out .  Yep . Yep .  And they 're gonna do the wiring for us .  It 's , um , it 's by Crown ,  and it 's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies ,  and , uh , when I s when I mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony .  And this is how apparently a lot of people are getting around it .  And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike .  It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well ,  so we 'll see if it 's any good .  But , uh , I think it 's promising .  Yep . Yep , so it was it was advertised for performers  and  Excuse me ?  Excuse me ?  That 's right .  Well we 're using the Crown P Z  These are Crown  aren't they ?  The P Z Ms are Crown ,  aren't they ?  Yeah , I thought they were .  And they work very well .  And then it we have to go to the planning session for that workshop .

Bmr013.G,"Yeah , why don't you summarize the  And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too .  For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead .  With Don , as well .  What do you mean , the prosodics ?  So what are they doing in Aurora ,  are they reading actual phone numbers ,  or , a a digit at a time , or ?  Cuz it 's  Connected .  So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different .  Right .  It 's the beginning of time in speech recognition .  It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life ,  yeah .  Right .  Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns .  Mitch showed that , and some , dissertations have shown that .  So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference .  And , depends what you 're interested in .  Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce .  And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling  and it really ,  I actually think that data should be used more .  That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence .  And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that ,  because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones .  Right .  Right .  But Right .  But it still is there 's a there are two steps .  One you know , one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something , like , "" gonna see you tomorrow "" ,  it could be "" going to "" or "" gonna "" or "" gonta s "" you know .  And , yeah .  "" Gonna see you tomorrow "" , uh , "" guh see you tomorrow "" .  ","And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too .  ",
Bmr013.G,"And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well .  Because , it 's not , um , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation .  It depends how you look at it , and  I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly ,  because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth .  All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced .  Uh , if you 're gonna add the features  it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you  because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion .  So people purposely don't add them .  So it 's useful to know which variant was was produced , at least at the phone level .  Right .  That 's all , I mean .  Exactly .  Exactly .  And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow ,  uh , uh ,  I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  Right .  That 's what I meant is  an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere .  So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram ,  but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say .  And then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing  Right .  Right .  Right .  Right .  You can add the features in , uh , but it 'll be underspecified .  Th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features .  And i if you 're  Well , we we 've probably have a separate , um , discussion of , uh of whether you can do that .  Yeah that that 's all I was thinking about .  it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be  Yeah .  That 's actually what I was thinking , is tha  the problem is when you run , uh , if you run a regular dictionary , um , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations ,  so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation ,  and so y  ","You can add the features in , uh , but it 'll be underspecified .

Bmr013.G,"they they I thought that they were  we should catch up on what Steve is ,  uh I think that would be a good i good idea .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Might  It might be  I was thinking it might be n  Well it might be neat to do some , phonetic , features on these , nonword words .  Are are these kinds of words that people never the "" huh ""s and the "" hmm ""s and the "" huh "" and the uh  These k No , I 'm serious .  There are all these kinds of functional , uh , elements .  I don't know what you call them .  But not just fill pauses but all kinds of ways of interrupting and so forth .  And some of them are , yeah , "" uh - huh ""s , and "" hmm ""s , and , "" hmm !

We can try running  we haven't done this yet because , um , uh , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer .  i basically I ran out of machines at SRI ,  cuz we 're running the evals  and I just don't have machine time there .  But , once that 's moved over , uh , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , um , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . um , on the word strings .  And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary .  Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine ,  but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  They might be OK .  It you know it really depends on a lot of things ,  but , I would have maybe a transciber , uh , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those .  That might save some time .  If they 're horrible it won't help at all ,  but they might not be horrible .  So but I 'll let you know when we , uh , have that .  Are the , um , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ?  I mean , have you noticed any difference ?  So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ?  We 're gonna be recording them every Monday ,  so  So they 're really running out of , data , prett I mean that 's good .  Um , OK .  ",,
Bmr013.G,"So  Yeah , please .  Go ahead .  And this afternoon .  Right .  Then lots of  Right .  Yeah we j we just needed a way to , strip , you know , all the comments , all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .  Um , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , uh , mouth noise , or , cough .  And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up  which I hadn't thought about before  but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like ,  um ,  well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is ,  and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct .  And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer ,  and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these ,  but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea .  And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel ,  they 're like it 's in the room .  And uh , Jane had this nice , uh , idea of having , like an extra , uh couple tiers ,  yeah .  And we were thinking , that is useful also when there 's uncertainties .  So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel  because maybe it was someone else 's breath ,  or Uh ,  so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing .  So a lot of little details ,  but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that .  So the idea is then , uh , Don can take , uh , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer  and we can , can run these .  So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data .  And , you know , start , working on it ,  so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from ,  ","And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel ,  And uh , Jane had this nice , uh , idea of having , like an extra , uh couple tiers ,  And we were thinking , that is useful also when there 's uncertainties .

Bmr013.G,"uh , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript .  Yeah , some of them are quite long .  Just from  I dunno  how long were  you did one ?  Right .  Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place  You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there ,  and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input .

I I don't think it 'll take too long .  So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect .  Right .  I 've already done five or six sets .  So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could .  You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also .  Uh , we don't have a active one  ","No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working ,  along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .  Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff ,  and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that .  I I don't think it 'll take too long .  So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect .

Bmr014.C,"but I 'll make sure he 's on the list .  I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts .  Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like Tuesdays and Thursdays ?  Oh well , whatever .  Yeah .  Well , we have about thirty - two hours  uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago ,  so we probably now have about thirty - five hours .  That 's including digits .  I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits .  Of of non - digits ?  Yeah , absolutely .  I mean , the digits don't take up that much time .  Nine two ,  right .  Mm - hmm .  Misspelled .  Right .  You don't know what they could be .  So how are you doing the  How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  So it sounds good .  Right .  Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ?  Okay , good .  Oh good .  Good .  Right .  Right .  It was a technical term that she didn't recognize ,  Right .  Obscure ,  yeah .  Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ?  Mm - hmm .  So there 's still no no knowledge using different channels at the same time .  You know what I mean ?  Across all of them .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Good .  Right .  So the The idea is that we need to have  We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want .  So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them ,  and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded .  And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded .  And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue .  And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,  a single password .  Each person will have a single password , user name and password .  And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it .  And that way each person only has to remember one password .  Mm - hmm .  ","Well , we have about thirty - two hours  That 's including digits .  Of of non - digits ?

Bmr014.C,"Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for other reasons .  And so that that 's a minor part of it ,  I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text .  So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um I would take them , and generate the web pages  and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted ,  and just uh , tell them , "" here 's the web page "" ,  um , "" you need a password "" .  So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords ,  and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .  I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .  But certainly I wouldn't want a printout .  These are big ,  and I would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it .  Well I certainly read books by hand .  But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web .  Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I I 'm I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these .  I wanna just be able to go to go to the web site and visit it as I want .  Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper .  So .  Well , no fre for the most  For the most frequent case they just say "" it 's OK ""  and then they 're done .  And I think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method .  I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to .  Oh that was another thing  I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient .  But I don't actually know .  Yes .  If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I I I think they should be allowed to do that .  Yeah .  Well , the only other choice is that the person would say "" no , don't distribute this meeting at all "" ,  and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say "" don't distribute it at all "" .  Well , but if if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient .  Um , I don't think so .  I mean , because if I object to the conversation .  ","If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I I I think they should be allowed to do that .  ",
Bmr014.C,"If I say "" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , "" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side .  I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it .  Um .  Yep .  Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former .  So .  Yep .  Right .  And that  Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright .  I think everyone in the meeting can access the web .  OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ?  Or what ?  Well , I don't think I  well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues .  Um . So giving them , you think a web site to say , "" if you wanna print it out here it is "" , is not sufficient ?  Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them .  Equivalent .  That 's right .  Mm - hmm .  No .  Whole utterances only .  And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh  it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level .  Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand .  I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient .  Oh .  I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Well I don't see any way of avoiding that .  I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like .  So that the  The only question is  The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me .  Whereas this web interface , I just get email ,  it 's all formatted ,  it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it .  Well  Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords .  So ,  Well , but  what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure .  So they have to call me and ask .  Well , we do because of privacy .  We can't just make it openly available on the web .  ",,
Bmr014.C,"But the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me .  Because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything .  I would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to .  Obviously they don't have to .  Yeah .  So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen .  It seems to me that sending them email , saying "" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK ,  If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password "" ,  seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise .  And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves .  Having it .  Well the in  the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it ,  so .  D you want me to grab one ?  Yeah , but you 're wired  aren't you ?

""  Well , I mean it  The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said .  They just have to make sure that it is available to them .  Right .  It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all .  Well , but they won't get that feedback .  All  no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time .  It just sends me  Right .  It just sends me the time intervals .  And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps .

So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and  then we bleep it .  Well since you seem to feel heart uh , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ?

Bmr014.C,"And so I don't think they need another signature .  Right .  So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form .  I 'm not really sure what 's best with that .  The problem is a lot of them are really short ,  and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line .  But I don't know how else to do it .  Hmm .  Yeah I think actually  my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good .  You know , if if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that .  Right .  That was all mumbled ?  I think Microsoft is  Sorry transcribers .  They 're gonna hate this meeting .  Actually Liz will like it .  You know , but .  Yep , yep , that 's right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well that would be good to get , definitely .  Just for corrections .  So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it ,  phone and in person .  Or mail , physical mail .  Any sub - wor  Yeah , OK .  I mean you could do it with PGP or things like that but it 's too complex .  You probably won't listen to it .  How about them energy crises .  Done ?  Shall we do digits ?  Um , oh by the way I did find a bunch  Uh , we should count out  how many more digits to forms do we have back there ?  That 's what I thought .  I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read .  And so we still have more than I thought we did .

Bmr014.E,"Alright .  So .  It is uh , must be February fifteenth .  Yeah .  Yeah .  We didn't have a front - end meeting today .  OK .  Mmm .  OK .  So .  Agenda .  Any agenda items today ?  OK .  OK audio monitoring , Jane .  Hmm .  Um .  I mean , were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance .  And if they are , then they can't be used .  So .  Um . Let 's see .  I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription  you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus .  And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas .  So maybe I 'll I 'll start with that actually .  Uh , um . Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about  because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point ,  and if there 's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come  and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out ,  in the because of uh the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up  and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing  and and I 'm sure help out his own time .  by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's he 's  So , uh in order  I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part .  Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard  because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated  and and  But um , we could try anyway ,  uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting ,  uh , say the day before .  OK .  You you wanna volunteer to do that ?  OK .  Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .  Uh .  Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting .  And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting .  But but But .  Uh . But we can try .  Maybe it 'll work .  Yeah .  Yeah .

Bmr014.E,"This this maybe brings up another topic which is um  So we 're done with that topic .  The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that .  Yeah .  Why why don't we do that .  So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?  So , um .  So let 's see we  And right now we can have up to six .  Yeah .  Oh .  So yeah so the only  Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .  Oh , we should do it .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Basically we found  Yeah .  But we 've had more problems with that .  And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that .  And so um , we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes ,  as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .  That seems to be the key issue .  Yeah .  Um , That 's the only thing with them .  But the quality seems really good  and  Um I heard from UW that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased .  They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf .  Yeah .  Uh , I don't know .  Probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff .  Yeah .  But anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and NIST and UW .  So .  Um . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony ,  uh , radio - mikes .  Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets  meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something ,  right ?  No ?  Oh .  OK .  Nothing against you and your hand - soldering  but  Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally  and  Yeah .  Yeah .

And , I  uh I mean it depends how this really ends up working out ,  but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare .  OK .  That 's  I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say "" here is a here is ""  I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , "" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ?  and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK "" .

Um and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded ,  OK ?  Then , if someone uh wants to review it , uh ,  and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out .  And then if they say that "" I have a potential problem with these things , "" then , you you say "" OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , "" you issue them a password , i in the  I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble  we have  there 's a problem with it .

Bmr014.F,"I I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down ,  but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things .  You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too .  Y you mean just uh on each on each line there 's a one word  right ?  It 's one token from the from the corpus .  Yeah , those are e extremely efficient  and I and I I agree that 's a very good use of it .  Well that 's that 's a way that 's  You know , the spell - check basically does that  but but in addition  yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .  Exactly .  And then you ca then you can do a s  Absolutely .  I agree .  That 's a very good that 's a very good uh , suggestion .  And that was that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed .  I didn't get to that point  but  So there are numbers , then there are acronyms ,  and then um , there 's a he she wants the uh , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is ,  so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either "" VOC "" for vocalized ,  like cough or like laugh or whatever ,  "" NONVOC "" for door - slam ,  and "" GLOSS "" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error .  I already had that convention  but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically  cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter .  That was what I was always planing on .  So that , you know you get a whole long list  exactly what you 're saying ,  you get a whole list of things that say "" curly bracket laugh curly bracket "" ,  then y you know it 's it 's  You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space ,  so man So many ways that error prone .  So , um , um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments ,  and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying ,  you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens  ","So there are numbers , then there are acronyms ,  and then um , there 's a he she wants the uh , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is ,  so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either "" VOC "" for vocalized ,  like cough or like laugh or whatever ,  "" NONVOC "" for door - slam ,  and "" GLOSS "" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error .  So , um , um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments ,  ",
Bmr014.F,"and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes .  But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand ,  because , you know I mean , jus  Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um and PLP is clear  but uh there are things that are not so well known , in  or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say "" nine two "" or you can say "" ninety - two "" ,  and uh  I 'd handle the numbers individually .  It would be separate  The letters would be separated in space  and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards  e  but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is ,  so gloss of whatever .  I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that .  Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there ,  and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh the you know , uh enumerated , or i  it 's not a good way of saying  but it 's it 's the specific uh way of stating these these letters .  And so anyway , the clean those are those things  and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format .  And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don .  But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized ,  the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins .  And uh , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running  and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet  cuz I 'm working  s re  this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized .

And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas .  Uh and so  because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions .

Bmr014.F,"And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon ,  and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech .

And on this side , this one 's picking up things like "" neural nets "" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't .

But um the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape ,  But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet .  So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that .  Yeah .  Yeah . They are .  Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient .  There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others .  Yeah .  I have one question .  So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ?  Because I I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the  Yeah .  The other thing too is it seems like  Go ahead .  I also  mm - hmm .  The  I agree that the consent forms were uh , I cons  ",,
Bmr014.F,"agree with what Adam 's saying , that um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .  And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l  I 'm not a law lawyer ,  but it strikes me that uh , we wouldn't want someone to say "" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it  but it was too hard to access "" .  So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it .  Now in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited .  But but it seems to me that sometimes um , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK .  That 's true .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking .  Good .  For security ?  Yeah , OK good .  Good point .  You could mail it to them .  Get an a mailing address .  But I think it 's easier to drop in the box .  Oh that 's interesting .  So much fun .  Well I guess  Yeah .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it .  Yeah .  I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing .  Cuz I think if they feel that uh , it 's I th I th  You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that ,  um , but but they might be able to argue "" oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down "" .  So it could that the burden would come back onto us .  So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint .  Yeah .  Or we could print it up for them ,  I mean we could offer that  but but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript .

Yeah . I 'd hafta look at that and think about it .  It 's it 's it 's I haven't worked with that either  so I 'm not sure  The way the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve .  You know , y you actually say that here is  Let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency ,  and and , uh ,  maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to , uh , short cut it by by uh , making some guesses ,  but but uh uh uh ,  I would , uh  I mean you could make some guesses from , uh from the auto - correlation or something  but but then , given those guesses , try ,  um , uh ,  only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency ,  and and see how much of the  take the one that 's maximum .

You 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh where where there are more than uh , where there 's more than one speaker  and the case where there 's only one speaker .

Bmr015.A,"other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon .

I mean that 's that 's w  Yeah .  Well , but yeah I don't think you can I mean you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame ,  so I mean  I I mean I I really I I really thought that the best way to do it ,  and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point ,  but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . However you 've come up you with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that  as coppo as opposed to all of the all the total energy .

I mean this is this is in in in in bands ?  Or or  Just just overall  And you just take the instantaneous frequency ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Oh !

Bmr015.A,"uh , um ,  e a it 's not just a minor part .  In fact , the I think I would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful .  So it 's critical  it 's not just incidental  it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful .  Because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of .  That 's our problem .  If we had nothing  if we had only linguistically - relevant things  if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components ,  and , uh , we we didn't have noise ,  we didn't have convolutional errors ,  we didn't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth ,  and moving your head  and all these sorts of things ,  then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now .  I mean you can  you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well .  The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart .  But that 's a research question ,  you know ?  And so  that  And we don't either .  I mean so so the thing is it 's it  right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting ,  and so we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations  because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed .  So , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well ,  and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time ,  but then we would still want to account for that ten percent ,  so .

I do .  I have agenda  and it 's all me .  Cuz no one sent me anything else .  I have no idea  but I just got it a few minutes ago .  Right when you were in my office it arrived .  So , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ?  I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits .  Oh , great .  I have a short thing about digits  and then uh I wanna talk a little bit about naming conventions ,  although it 's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it .  So maybe just talk about it very briefly  and take the details to the people who for whom it 's relevant .  So the only thing I wanna say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set .  There are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read .  So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms  and extract out pieces that are in error .  So I wa Uh . Two things .  The first is what should we do about digits that were misread ?  My opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely ,  and have them read again by someone else .  You know , the grouping is completely random ,  so it it 's perfectly fine to put a a group together again  of errors  and have them re - read ,  just to finish out the test set .  Um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said .  So those are those are the two options .  What the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , you extract the right string .  Yeah . And didn't notice .  Which happens in a few places .  So so  Correct .  And so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said ,  but then but then the transcript isn't the Aurora test set anymore .  I don't think that really matters  because the conditions are so different .  And that would be a little easier .  Mmm , five or six times .  No , it 's not much at all .  OK .  Four thousand .  OK .  Four thousand lines .  And each line is between one and about ten digits .  I didn't I didn't compute the average .  I think the average was around four or five .  Yep .  Yep .

Yeah , I was just wond  I thought I had had all of them back from you .  And then the other thing is that , uh , the forms in front of us here that we 're gonna read later , were suggested by Liz  because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits .  And so , uh , I just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions  and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense  and if anyone has any comments on it .  Uh , yes ,  although we could switch it back .  The problem was O and zero .  Although we could switch it back and tell them always to say "" zero "" or always to say "" O "" .  Mm - hmm .  Sure .  Right .  The the problem also is she did want to stick with digits .  I mean I 'm speaking for her since she 's not here .

I mean , this is something that Liz and I spoke about  and , since this was something that Liz asked for specifically , I think we need to defer to her .  Do something different ,  yeah .  It was .  Joint .  Yep .  It 's  That 's because they set the one up at UW  that 's not on our side , that 's on the U - dub side .  And so U - UW set it up as a moderated list .

Or something like that ,  so .  Right .  Right .  How how many awards are there ,  do you know ?  Mm - hmm .  I thought it was smaller ,  that it was like four or five ,  wasn't it ?  Uh it doesn't matter ,  we 'll find out one way or another .  Mm - hmm .  Exactly what we say in the proposal .  Yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for Meeting Recorder .  Yep .  Are there any students in your class who are expressing interest ?  Other than the one who 's already here .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Yep .  It just , uh we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , uh , doing recognition .  And Liz had some suggestions on naming  and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming .  So , uh , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length  so that sorting is easier .  Um ,  same number of characters  so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want .  And that 's easy enough to do .  And I don't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names .  So that means , uh , instead of calling it "" MR one "" , "" MR two "" , you 'd call it "" MRM zero zero one "" ,  "" MRM zero zero two "" , things like that .  Just so that they 're they 're all the same length .  The problem is that they 're a lot of fields .  Alright ,  so we we have th we 're gonna have the speaker ID ,  the session ,  uh uh ,  information on the microphones ,  information on the speak on the channels and all that .  And so if each one of those is a fixed length , the sorting becomes a lot easier .  Yep .  And as I said , the it 's we just don't have that many that that 's a big deal .  And so , uh , um , at some point we have to sort of take a few days off ,  let the transcribers have a few days off ,  make sure no one 's touching the data  and reorganize the file structures .  ","Yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for Meeting Recorder .

",
Bmr015.B,"And when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming .  Right .  Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names ,  I would change them to match .  So instead of being MR one it would be MRM zero zero one .  But I don't think that 's a big deal .  So for for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers  for meeting I Ds .

And you know that one is a different headset and different channel .  And so we just need some naming conventions on that .  And , uh ,  that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up .  We have some new microphones that I 'd like to start trying out ,  um ,  once I test them .

Bmr015.F,"Well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap ,  just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that ,  and count on accuracy during the sparser phases .  Cuz there are large s spaces of the  That 's a good point .  There are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all .  Someone 's giving a presentation ,  or whatever .  That 's that 's a good that 's a good thought .  And , um , let 's see , there was one other thing I was gonna say .  I I think it 's really interesting data to work with ,  I have to say , it 's very enjoyable .  I really , not not a problem spending time with these data .  Really interesting .  And not just because I 'm in there .  No , it 's real interesting .  Di - digital camera .

"
Bmr015.F,"OK , so maybe the question is notating it .  Yeah ?  OK , well  Well this is in very interesting  because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , uh , speech recognition research and discourse research  because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative .  And breath ,  you know , everyone breathes ,  they breathe all the time .  And once in a while breath is communicative ,  but r very rarely .  OK , so now , I had a discussion with Chuck about the data structure  and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master  there 'll be a master transcript  which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses .  And the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts .  You know , like , Don 's been writing scripts  and and ,  uh , to process it for the speech recognition side .  Discourse side will have  this this side over he the we we 'll have a s ch  Sorry , not being very fluent here .  But , um ,  this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative .  OK . So then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths .  So what I would r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ?  Could we get a breath detector ?  Well , I mean , you just have no idea .  I mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute ,  and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time .  And you wanna be sure it 's used ,  and you wanna be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible ,  and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal .  Well , but  Well , OK . So now there 's there 's another another possibility  which is , um , the time boundaries could mark off words from nonwords .  And that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient .  OK . But that would maybe include a pause as well ,  and that wouldn't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ?  That 's what they 've been doing .  So , within an overlap segment , they they do this .  Yeah , you 're saying it 's uncharted territory .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  OK , fair enough .

Bmr015.F,"I guess , um , I uh , what I was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ?

OK .  I guess there 's another aspect  which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , uh , recordings ,  so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones .

Well , there 's a there 's  I  Yeah , I I think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that ,  um ,  you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gonna transcribe ,  u th they 're gonna transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot .  If there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that .  Right .  But  Right . But if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on Morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , don't don't worry about that .  So what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um  So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed .  But outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribed .  So you just somebody can't rely on that data and say "" that 's perfectly clean data "" .  Uh do you see what I 'm saying ?  So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .  Yeah , so  One of the  um , just to add to this  one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them .  I mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays .  And so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked ,  so that you know where the boundaries are .  So  I mean , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation .  We don't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all ,  but , I mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , I 'd say put them in if possible .  Mm - hmm .

I wouldn't make that generalization  cuz sometimes people will say , "" And then I "" and there 's a long pause  and finish the sentence  and and sometimes it looks coherent and and the  I mean it 's it 's not a simple problem .  But it 's really  And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off  and so it 's coupled with the problem that Thilo 's isn't perfect either .  I mean , we 've i th it 's like you have a merging problem plus so merging plus this problem of , uh , not  y i i if the speech - nonspeech were perfect to begin with , the detector , that would already be an improvement ,  but that 's impossible , you know , i that 's too much to ask .  And so i and may you know , I mean , it 's  I think that there always th there would have to be some hand - tweaking ,  ","cuz sometimes people will say , "" And then I "" and there 's a long pause  and finish the sentence  and and sometimes it looks coherent and and the  And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off  ",
Bmr018.A,"but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things .  I 've I 've discussed it with Thilo and I mean  in terms of not him doing it ,  but we we discussed some of the parameters of that  and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that .  Well , it 's just , you know , a matter of we had the revolution we had the revolution of improved , uh , interface , um , one month too late ,  but it 's like , you know , it 's wonderful to have the revolution ,  so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with .  Yeah ,  that 's right .  That 's right .  Good point .  Yeah .  Well the problem is I you know I I it 's a it 's a really good question ,  and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things  because you have to get the mouse up there on the t on the text line  and i and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down  I mean , i it depends on how lar  th there 's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other , or or vice versa .  It 's not a simple question .  But , you know , I mean , in principle , like , you know , if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one 's easier .  I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly ,  because you have to , uh , maneuver around on the on both windows then .  To delete .  It 's possible .  Well , like , I think there 's a complication which is that that you can have speech and noise in s  uh , you know , on the same channel , the same speaker ,  so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop  and , uh , I mean , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases ,  and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around .  It 's not a simple not a simple problem .  Well , and also , I mean , I still haven't I still haven't given up on forced alignment .  I think that when Brian comes , this 'll be uh an interesting aspect to ask him as well b  when Brian Kingsbury comes .  Yeah , good question .  Well , Ryan could come .  That 's what my hope has been ,  and that 's what that 's what you know , ever since the the February meeting that I transcribed from last year , forced alignment has been on the on the table as a way of cleaning them up later .  ","but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things .  so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with .

I do take notes .  It was an interesting session .  One of those w  Yeah , that 's it .  So , I mean , this was a very provocative slide .  She put this up , and it was like this is this p people kept saying , "" Can I see that slide again ?

After the power out  Well this wasn't Actually , this wasn't a before your meeting , this was , um , Tuesday afternoon when , um , uh , Robert just wanted to do a little recording ,  and the power had gone out earlier in the day .

I wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was .  Yes ,  um ,  he 's I I 'm sorry , I should have forwarded that along .

I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um ,  how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries ,  and  I mean , is it pretty easy ?  As of what point ?  I mean .

I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight - forward .  I thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it .  Right .  So you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things ,  you can't you can't just look  Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ?  Mmm .  Because really the the at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries .  We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries ,  so  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right , exactly .  So that 's why I was wondering if it  I mean , maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff , we can just not use that  and  We c you know what ?  Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these .  Cuz you can see the seat numbers ,  and then you can see what type of mike they were using .  And so we just look for , you know , somebody sitting next to Adam at one of the meetings  What what is why do you need the , um , the forced alignment for the HLT I mean for the Eurospeech paper ?  So it was to get it was to get more data and better to to squeeze the boundaries in .  Ah , OK .  Yeah .  Thilo 's won't put down two separate marks in that case  Yeah , we were never just gonna go with these as the final alignments .  We were always gonna run them past somebody .

Bmr018.B,"but the speech from the a actual other channels .  If you  Actually if if you have a larger head , that mike 's gotta go farther away which means the the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down .  Can I see that ?  I yeah , I don't want it on ,  I just I just want to , um , say what I think is a problem with this .  If you are wearing this over your ears and you 've got it all the way out here ,  then the balance is gonna want to pull it this way .  Where as if somebody with a smaller head has it back here ,  right ?  Yeah .  Then it then it falls back this way so it 's  So this is supposed to be under that little protuberance .  Yeah .  So it 's really supposed to go more like this than like this .  But then isn't that going to  Well , I guess you can control that .  It would be an advantage .  The other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back .  Hang a five pound weight off the back .  Counter - balance .  Did did they give a talk on this or was this informal ?  What was the , um the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ?  What was their rough what was their conclusion ?  Did they ever try going going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks ,  or ?  Mm - hmm .  Do you remember who the groups were that we 're doing ?  Was were there folks from BBN presenting ?  Was SRA one of the groups talking about summarization , no ?  This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora .  That the differences we 're seeing in the front - end is b  are irrelevant  once you get a real recognizer at the back - end .  You know ?  But doesn't their conclusion just sort of you could have guessed that before they even started ?  Because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better ,  then as you approach there 's a point where you can't get any better ,  right ?  You get everything right .  So they 're all approaching .  But what I 'm saying is that th they have to , as they all get better , they have to get closer together .  But they 're all going the same way ,  right ?  So you have to get closer .  Oh they didn't ?  Maybe they should have said "" focus "" or something .  ",,

I don't know when would be a good excuse for it ,  but I just can't wait to be giving a talk t and and and use the example from last week with everybody t doing the digits at once .  I 'd love to play somebody that .  It was .  It was really efficient .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time ,  yeah .

So , i I I will be I mean , he 's taking a very early flight  and we do have the time work difference running the right way ,  but I still think that there 's no way we could start before eleven .  It might end up really being twelve .  So when we get closer we 'll find people 's plane schedules , and let everybody know .  Uh , So . That 's good .

Yes  except that if they had if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it , and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them  It 's just dependent of how much  Yeah .  Can we pipeline it so that say there 's , uh , the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we you run it through this other other stuff ?  Uh ,  OK , so .  Oh , that 's right .  So the first thing is the automatic thing ,  and then it 's then it 's then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up ,  and then it 's IBM .  OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting ,  and then and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed .

Why wouldn't we s @ @ w  i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them  I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ?  So if we if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing .  So you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ?  So how do you  So I don't  I 'm I 'm now entirely confused about what they do .  So , they 're they 're looking at a mixed signal ,  or they 're looking  what what are they looking at visually ?  But the procedure that you 're imagining , I mean , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them ,  and they have multiple ,  uh , well , let 's see , there isn't we don't have transcription yet .  So but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically ,  and those show up on the mixed signal ?  There 's a @ @ clicks ?  There 're separate ribbons .  And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ?  OK , so The way you 're imaging is they kind of play it ,  and they see oh this happened , then this happened , then and if it 's about right , they just sort of let it slide ,  and if it if it there 's a question on something , they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form .

Yeah , so they were  And yeah , like multiple multiple video cameras coverin covering every everybody every place in the room ,  uh , the yeah the the mikes in the middle , the head - mounted mikes , the lapel mikes , the array , uh , with  well , there 's some discussion of fifty - nine ,  they might go down to fifty - seven  Because , uh , there is , uh , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head .  I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for ,  but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed ,  and and and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really there 's really two recording systems .  So they may not be precisely synchronous , but the but there 's two two recording systems ,  one with , I think , twenty - four channels , and one with sixty - four channels .  And the sixty - four channel one is for the array ,  but they 've got some empty channels there ,  and anyway they like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if for for the KEMAR head if they go go with that .

Um , yeah , we sh we should just have you have you read it , but , I mea ba i i uh , we 've all got these little proceedings ,  but , um , basically , it was about , um , uh , going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using using data from something else , and adapting , and how well that works .  Uh , so in in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did , uh , except that this was not with meeting stuff , it was with  uh , like I think they s didn't they start off with Broadcast News system ?  And then they went to  Yeah .  TI - digits was one of them , and , uh , Wall Street Journal .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Probably .  That might be hard .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  sure .  Yeah .  Yeah , and they have I mean they have better adaptation than we had than that that system ,  so they  um ,  ",,
Bmr018.C,"yeah , we should probably what would  actually what we should do , uh , I haven't said anything about this ,  but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that that , uh , you know , got our interest ,  and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what what was good about the conference ,  yeah .  Columbia have anything ?  No .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , that was an interesting discussion ,  uh , I  Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked ,  but I didn't wanna I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , uh , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about ,  uh , it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative ,  but but , uh ,  I mean , the missing thi  so so what they were saying it 's one of these things is you know , all you need is more data , sort of  But I mea i wh it @ @ that 's that 's dissing it , uh , improperly ,  I mean , it was a nice study .  Uh , they were doing this it wasn't word - sense disambiguation , it was  was it w was it word - sense ?  Yes .  Yeah , yeah .  OK .  Right .  And so , what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines , and they had different amounts of data ,  and so they did like , you know , eight different methods that everybody , you know , uh , argues about about , "" Oh my my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine . ""  And , uh , they were started off with a million words that they used ,  which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using .  So they went up , being Microsoft , they went up to a billion .  And then they had this log scale showing a  you know , and and naturally everything gets  they  well , it 's a big company ,  I didn't I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative ,  but i i i  Yeah .  OK .  But , I mean , yes .  Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that uh that you got better and better performance with more and more data .  Um , but the the real point was that the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place ,  and and by by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines  ",,
Bmr018.C,"and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture ,  so ,  uh ,  That  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  could well be .  So so , I mean , that was that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point ,  but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , uh , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant  which is not at n t as for as I know in in tasks I 'm more familiar with @ @ is not at all true .  What i what is is true is that different learning machines have different properties ,  and you wanna know what those properties are .  And someone else sort of implied that well we s you know , a all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are .  We don't know them perfectly , but we know that some kinds use more memory and and some other kinds use more computation  and some are are hav have limited kind of discrimination , but are just easy to use , and others are  You would guess  Yeah .  It w  Yeah .  Eventually .  O one would  Well  well that 's getting cl  I mean ,  yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true ,  but but , uh , I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case ,  but , uh , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different ,  I mean , I think somebody w w let 's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in in Broadcast News ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  But anyway , I I I think it 's it 's just the the i it 's it 's it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , uh , uh , commenters in the crowd came up with  that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about ,  and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way ,  and and the the , uh ,  one one person ga g g got up and made a a brief defense ,  uh , but it was a different kind of grounds ,  it was that that , uh , i w the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important , but in fact th they didn't have it available .  ",,
Bmr018.C,"Um , but the other point to make a again is that , uh , machine learning still does matter ,  but it it matters more in some situations than in others ,  and it and also there 's there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways .  I mean , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using ,  or you care , you know , what recall time is ,  or you care , you know , and and  Yeah ,  or or , uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  And there 's cost !  There 's just plain cost ,  you know ,  so so these , I mean th the in the in the speech side , the thing that @ @ always occurs to me is that if you  if you uh  one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred ,  and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter ,  that 's that 's gonna be better .  because people , I mean , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on  and then that 's it for the r for all of time .  I mean , people are gonna be doing other different things , and so it these these things matters matter .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  Anyway ,  tea is tea is , uh , starting .  Let 's do it all at once .  We @ @ let 's try that again .  Boy , is that ever efficient .  Yeah .  Yeah .  ",,
Bmr018.D,"It never crashes on me .  What is what is that ?  Ah .  Ah .  So then there would be no temp files .  OK . Hmm .  Oh wait It  it doesn't clear them ,  OK .  But that 's usually the meeting that I recorded , and it neve it doesn't crash on me .  Oh  Oh , right .  OK .  Huh , OK .  It was quick .  Well , I had this idea we could make our whole meeting faster that way .  And we 'll just all leave ,  and  Yeah .  Uh , I had one question about  Aren't the UW folks coming this weekend ?  Next weekend ?  Sorry , not not not the days coming up , but  Yeah ,  within ten days .  So , are we do we have like an agenda or anything that we should be  OK .  Wait , this is on on Sunday ?  Or Saturday ?  OK .  Except for it doesn't do well on short things , remember .  It will miss them .  It will miss most of the really short things .  Like that .  Uh - huh .  It will it will miss  Yeah , you have to say "" uh - huh "" more slowly to to get c  No , I 'm s I 'm actually serious .  So it will miss stuff like that which  Right ,  and that 's what I 'm not sure about .  Yeah , it 's very slow to do that .  That w  Yeah .  That 's actually what I thought of , loading the chopped up waveforms , I mean , you know , that that would make it faster  So .  Right , but if you  a at some point  No , I mean the individual channels that were chopped up that  it 'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those short segments .  Cuz you don't really nee like nine tenths of the time you 're throwing most of them out ,  but what you need are tho that particular channel , or that particular location ,  and ,  um , might be nice , cuz we save those out already , um , to be able to do that .  But it won't work for IBM of course ,  it only works here cuz they 're not saving out the individual channels .  I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal ,  but you would know that they were there , and then you would switch .  Right .  And then you would switch into the other  Yeah .  But there 's no overlap during the digit readings , so it shouldn't really matter .  Right , but that 's I mean , that was our plan ,  but it 's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time .  So  ","Except for it doesn't do well on short things , remember .  Like that .

",
Bmr018.D,"so we you know , we had spent a lot of time , um , writing up the HLT paper  and we wanted to use that , uh , kind of analysis ,  but the HLT paper has , you know , it 's a very crude measure of overlap .  It 's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap ,  it 's just whether or not the , um , the segments that were all synchronized , whether there was some overlap somewhere .  And , you know , that pointed out some differences ,  so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward .  If it were straight - forward then we would try it ,  but  so , it 's sort of good to hear that it was not straight - forward , thinking if we can get decent forced alignments , then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time ,  but , um  and the but there are some issues of this timing , um , in the recordings  and  I  yeah , that was sort of a side issue .  And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to  so so there are some things available ,  and I don't know too much about this area  where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them ,  and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference .  Which a at least is well defined ,  and  um , but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it wasn't  I guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly and not in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now ,  so .  Well less than a week .  So um , so I don't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a Eurospeech paper at this point .  Right .  Actually y we can tell from the data that we have ,  um , yeah , there 's a way to tell .  It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people ,  and , um , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , you know , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that .  So so I guess that 's sort of a last  ther there 're sort of a few things we could do .  One is just do like non - lapels if we can get good enough alignments .  Another one was to try to get  somehow align Thilo 's energy segmentations with what we have .

Bmr018.D,"But then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation .  But maybe there 's something that could be done .  Well , I guess I I wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments  because that 's ju way too early , but to be able to report , you know , actual numbers .  Like if we if we had hand - transcribed pe good alignments or hand - checked alignments , then we could do this paper .  It 's not that we need it to be automatic .  But without knowing where the real words are , in time  To to know what an overlap really if it 's really an overlap , or if it 's just a a a segment correlated with an overlap ,  and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper .  So , um , if we d  it might be possible to take Thilo 's output  and like if you have , um , like right now these meetings are all ,  um ,  you know , they 're time - aligned ,  so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word ,  if Thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out  because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word .  But , um , you know , if there are things  Yeah , if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here ,  and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you ,  so , um  Well it w it would , but , um , we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin  and we don't really know ,  I mean ,  yeah it 's  I mean , if you have any ideas .  I would  Right .  I mean , that that would be really helpful .  That was sort of another possibility .  Yeah .  Right .  I mean , I guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with ,  then we have a good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to .  So I 'm no I don't know if this  Oh it 's it 's a  yeah .  Yeah .  But he he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly ,  but that might be OK ,  an  Right .  And you can also see in the waveform  exac  yeah .  Yeah .  I think it 's  ","if Thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out  because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word .  But , um , you know , if there are things  Yeah , if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here ,  and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you ,  ",
Bmr018.D,"You could just say it 's a noise , though , and write , you know , a post - processor will just  all you have to do is just  or just say it 's just put "" X , "" you know , like "" not speech "" or something ,  and then you can get  Yeah , or  Anyways , so I I guess  There 's something nice , though , about keeping , and this is probably another discussion , keeping the stuff that Thilo 's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it .  Because then when you align it , then the alignment can you can put a reject model or whatever ,  and you 're consistent with th the automatic system ,  whereas if you delete it  Yeah , or some , you know , dummy reject mod  whatever ,  yeah .  That 's actually a better way to do it  cuz the a the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than  I mean if it 's just as easy ,  but  Anyway , quick question , though , at a high level do people think ,  let 's just say that we 're moving to this new era of like using the , um , pre - segmented t you know , non - synchronous conversations ,  does it make sense to try to take what we have now , which are the ones that , you know , we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time - tightened , and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings , or is it better to just , you know , forget that and tr  I mean , it 's  Right .  That was everybody 's hope .  And maybe we can for the non - lapel , but  is it worth  if we can't then we can fake it even if we 're we report , you know , we 're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time .  Uh uh , that 's a good question actually .  Actually that 's a good question  because we 'd have to completely redo those meetings , and we have like ten of them now .  No , you 're right ,  actually  Uh , no , that 's a good point , though ,  because for feature extraction like for prosody or something , I mean , the meetings we have now ,  it 's a good chunk of data  we need to get a decent f  OK .  So we should at least try it even if we can't ,  right ?  I mean , we might be able , at the very worst , we can get transcribers to correct the cases where  I mean , you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition 's so poor .  Right ?  ","does it make sense to try to take what we have now , which are the ones that , you know , we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time - tightened , and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings , or is it better to just , you know , forget that and tr  because for feature extraction like for prosody or something , I mean , the meetings we have now ,  it 's a good chunk of data  ",
Bmr018.D,"And so you 're  Yeah .  So we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments .  Yeah .  Right .  But what you do wanna do is take the , even if it 's klugey , take the segments the synchronous segments , the ones from the HLT paper , where only that speaker was talking .  Use those for adaptation ,  cuz if you if you use everything , then you get all the cross - talk in the adaptation , and it 's just sort of blurred .  And that we know , I mean , we have that .  And it 's about roughly two - thirds , I mean , very roughly averaged .  That 's not completely negligible .  Like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so .  It really it depends a lot .  This is just sort of an overall  Yeah .  But I think we 're oh , Morgan 's talk went very well , I think .  I think Morgan 's talk went very well it woke  you know , it was really a well presented and got people laughing  Yeah .

Bmr018.D,"because they weren't working with meeting type data ,  but he got sort of an overview on some of the different approaches ,  so .  Well there 're  this was the last day ,  but , I mean , there 's that 's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field ,  I I don't know exactly that everyone submits to this particular conference ,  but  yet there was , let 's see , this was on the last day , Mitre , BBN , and , um , Prager  um , I wo it was  no it was  this was Wednesday morning .  The sentence ordering one , was that Barselou , and these guys ?  Anyway , I I it 's in the program ,  I should have read it to remind myself ,  but that 's sort of useful  and I think like when Mari and Katrin and Jeff are here it 'd be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts  cuz we already have  you know ,  yeah .  Right .  But I think what 's interesting is there 's all these different evaluations , like just , you know , how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not ,  and that 's what 's was sort of interesting to me is that there 's different ways to do it ,  and  Hm - umm .  No .  Yeah .  The data issue comes up all the ti  Yeah yeah yeah  And there and their and  and that you could do better with more data , I mean , that 's clearly statistically  You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training ?  If you add more data ?  Or  Huh .  It 's just no  Well it 's different for different tasks .  So it depends a lot on whether , you know , it disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better ,  right ?  You 're you 're you can assume similar distributions ,  but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of , uh , test data then your training data , then that extra data wouldn't generalize ,  so .

I just don't think  Yeah , and I I think that they 're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals .  So .  Yeah , that 's actually true .  Yeah , you 're right .

Bmr018.E,"Well , the problem is that the the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals .  The problem is that that the Tcl - TK interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms .  And so when I tried that that was the first thing I tried when I first started it ,  right ?  Well it it does some sort of shape pre - computation so that it can then scroll it quickly ,  yeah .  But then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly .  So .  I mean , we we could do different interfaces ,  right ?  I mean , so so we could use like X Waves instead of Transcriber ,  and it loads faster , certainly .  Well that 's what I tried originally .  So I I actually before , uh , Dave Gelbart did this , I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform ,  but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll .  So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go "" kur - chunk ! ""  And so it just was not doable with the current interface .  I think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that .  An  But isn't  The chopped up waveforms .  Isn't that  And wouldn't that be the same as the mixed signal ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , hopefully , I mean  The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized .  So I think they should be able to hear .  The only problem is is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not .  So , I don't know .  Right but but once once you know that they happen , you can at least listen to the close talking ,  so .  Right .  Right ,  so so  did Dave Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ?  I had suggested it before .  I just don't know whether he did it or not .  Yeah .  Yeah .  We should get him to do that  because , uh , I think that would be much , much faster than going to the menu .  Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it .  Just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster .

It might be easier to delete something that 's wrong than to insert something that 's missing .  What do you think , Jane ?  Yeah .  Cuz then then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick a time .  Yeah , I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment ,  right ?

And and in in the in the previous version where in the n which is used now , there , the backchannel would would be in - between there somewhere ,  so .  That would be more natural  but  Yeah .

For some meetings , I 'm I 'm sure it i  n  That 's And some on some meetings it 's good .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So we should perhaps just select meetings on which the speech - nonspeech detection works well ,  and just use , those meetings to to to send to IBM and , do the other ones .  Uh , it really depends .  Um , my my my impression is that it 's better for meetings with fewer speakers ,  and it 's better for for meetings where nobody is breathing .  Yeah ,  ","Yeah . Yeah , I also used I think something around zero point five seconds for the speech - nonspeech detector  Whi - which could have one drawback .

Yeah ,  I thought that was  Yeah .  Yeah .  They were , um , reasonably tight , but not excruciatingly tight .  That would 've taken more time .  I just wanted to get it so tha So that if you have like "" yeah "" in a swimming in a big bin , then it 's  I can't answer that ,  but but my main goal was um , in these areas where you have a three - way overlap and one of the overlaps involves "" yeah "" , and it 's swimming in this huge bin , I wanted to get it so that it was clo more closely localized .  I I wanted to  I wanted it to be able to l he be heard normally ,  so that if you if you play back that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , it sounds like a normal word .  It doesn't sound like the person  i it sounds normal .  It 's as if the person could 've stopped there .  And it wouldn't have been an awkward place to stop .  Now sometimes you know , it 's these are involved in places where there was no time .  And so , there wouldn't be a gap afterwards because  I mean some cases , there 're some people um , who who have very long segments of discourse where , you know , they 'll they 'll breath and then I put a break .  But other than that , it 's really pretty continuous  and this includes things like going from one sentence into the u one utterance into the next , one sentence into the next ,  um ,  w without really stopping .

Bmr020.C,"but but it would be a shorter p shorter break than maybe you might like .  But the goal there was to not have the text be so so crudely parsed in a time bin .  I mean , because from a discourse m purpose it 's it 's more it 's more useful to be able to see  and also you know , from a speech recognition purpose my impression is that if you have too long a unit , it 's it doesn't help you very much either ,  cuz of the memory .  So , that means that the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context ,  but my general goal when there was sufficient space , room , pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling gap .  Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as .  You know , Wally Chafe says that um , in producing narratives , the spurts that people use tend to be , uh , that the the what would be a pause might be something like two two seconds .  And um , that would be , you know one speaker .

"
Bmr020.C,"so far I 've discussed it with one ,  with uh  And I had a about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday ,  we went through uh EDU - one , at some extent .  And it occurred to me that um that basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider it as a staggered mixed file ,  we had some discussion over the weekend a about at at this other meeting that we were all a at  um , about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio .  And um , in in a way , by by having this this chunk and then the backchannel after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel .  And um , it occurred to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um ,  um ,  the the the maximal gain , it 's from the IBM people , may be in long stretches of connected speech .  So it 's basically a whole bunch of words which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn .  So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , but but what I 'm thinking is that in the EDU meetings , they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers .  And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , then , when when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels .  It seems to me that um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard ,  but then there 's this question of the time @ @ uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be uh y y y  And I 'm not exactly sure how that how that would work with the with the backchannels .  And ,  so um  And certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words , taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , that would be hard .  So , m my thought is i I 'm having this transcriber go through the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker ,  and the idea that these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , and maybe not for the other channels .  Well , it  OK .  I think I I think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels  but , you know , that is so time - consuming ,  and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible ,  ","And um , in in a way , by by having this this chunk and then the backchannel after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel .  the the the maximal gain , it 's from the IBM people , may be in long stretches of connected speech .

"
Bmr020.C,"then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data ,  which would be useful when it comes back to us .  And um  Oh also , at the same time she when she goes through this , she 'll be uh If there 's anything that was encoded as a pause , but really has something transcribable in it , then she 's going to uh , make a mark  w uh , so you know , so that that bin would be marked as it as double dots  and she 'll just add an S .  And in the other in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put a s dash ,  and I 'll go through and it and um , you know , with a with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category .  I 'll just , you know , recode them .  But um , um , the transcribable events that um , I 'm considering in this , uh , continue to be laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that ,  so I 'm not stripping out anything ,  just just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech .  Yeah ?  Oh , OK .  So what it what it what it involves is is really a s uh , uh , the original pr procedure ,  but only applied to uh , a certain strategically chosen s aspect of the data .  So  You got it .  Yes !  Yes !  Oh yeah !  OK .  We start with your presegmented version  We start with the presegmented version  Yeah .  And then um , the transcriber , instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around , and deciding if it 's speech or not , but not transcribing anything .  OK ?  Instead of doing that , which was our original plan , the tra They focus on the dominant speaker  Yeah .  So what they do is they identify who 's the di dominant speaker , and when the speaker starts .  So I mean , you 're still gonna  So we 're  It 's based on your se presegmentation ,  that 's the basic thing .  Yeah .  Exactly .  Mm - hmm .  Uh No . No , no .  Huh - uh .  S  That 's that 's why she 's notating the start and end points of the dominant speakers .  So , on a you know , so i in EDU - one , i as far as I listened to it , you start off with a a s section by Jerry .  So Jerry starts at minute so - and - so ,  and goes until minute so - and - so .  ",Yeah .  ,
Bmr020.C,"And then Mark Paskin comes in .  And he starts at minute such - and - such ,  and goes on till minute so - and - so .  OK .  And then meanwhile , she 's listening to both of these guys ' channels ,  determining if there 're any cases of misclassification of speech as nothing , and nothing as speech ,  and a and adding a tag if that happens .  But you know , I wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that um , the part that I listened to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments of the bins .  So far we haven't .  So this is not gonna be a major part of the process ,  at least least not in not on ones that that really  Mm - hmm ?  Well there 's the question o of whether  Well , OK .  She i It 's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she 's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from IBM anyway .  So if it 's only inserting "" mm - hmm ""s here and there , then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through I B M , then be patched together , then be double checked here .  Well , I guess  I 'm I 'm open to that ,  it was  Well yea  OK , good .  I mean the detector , this  Now , you were saying that they they differ in how well they work depending on channel s sys systems and stuff .  But EDU is great .  How interesting .  You know  Yeah .  Yeah ?  Yeah ?  Is intelligible .  That 's interesting !  Cuz that 's that 's directly related to the e end task .  How interesting !  Well , eh , listening does take time too .  How interesting !  Well EDU  So I was gonna say , EDU - one is good enough ,  maybe we could include it in this in this set of uh , this stuff we send .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Oh , OK .  Oh , I see .  Know what numbers .  Oh , that 'd be great .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  They do already .  Yeah .  Well , we have the unintelligibility convention .  And actually they have one also ,  which  Certainty .  Was is it in a in a what what is the t  In a good meeting ,  what ?  Yeah .  Oh I see ,  the characteristics .  Uh - huh .  OK .  OK .  Just  Hmm !

Bmr020.C,"And I guess we could just indicate to the transcribers not to encode that if they  We could still do the beep file .  OK .  OK .  OK .  OK .  That would be great .  Wow , that 's a great idea .  Excellent .  Oh , I 'd be delighted with that ,  I I was very impressed with the with the result .  Yeah .  Oh yeah ,  interesting .  Oh yeah .  Oh yeah ,  I pr I much prefer this ,  I was just trying to find a way  Cuz I I don't think the staggered mixed channel is awfully good as a way of handling overlaps .  But  but uh  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Oh , I 'd be delighted .  Yeah .  Well you were suggesting You suggested maybe just not sending that part of the meeting .  But  Do you  Would you would  Yeah , go ahead .  Well ,  so  I mean  So my standard approach has been if it 's not someone close - miked , then , they don't end up on one of the close - miked channels .  They end up on a different channel .  And we have any number of channels available ,  I mean it 's an infinite number of channels .  So just put them on some other channel .  Yeah ,  that 's right .  Well , they have a convention , in their own procedures , which is for a background sound .  Yeah .  Oh , I think I think it 'd be easy to to say "" background laptop "" .  Well because one of them  Oh , I s  background laptop or , background LT wouldn't take any time .  And  Oh , you can tell .  Acoustically , can't you tell ?  Oh is it ?  Oh !  Yeah .  OK .  That sounds good .  That sounds good .  OK .  Yeah ,  s a  Well , as it comes back , we have a uh when we can use the channelized interface for encoding it , then it 'll be easy for us to handle .  But but if if out of context , they can't tell if it 's a channeled speak uh , you know , a close - miked speaker or not , then that would be confusing to them .  I don't know ,  I it doesn't  I don't  Either way would be fine with me ,  I don't really care .  I have o I have one question .  Do you think we should send the um that whole meeting to them and not worry about pre - processing it ?  Or  Uh , what I mean is we we should leave the part with the audio in the uh , beep file that we send to IBM for that one ,  or should we start after the that part of the meeting is over  in what we send .  ",,
Bmr020.C,"So , the part where they 're using sounds from their from their laptops .  w If we have speech from the laptop should we just uh , excise that from what we send to IBM ,  or should we i give it to them and let them do with it what they can ?  OK ,  that 'd be nice to have a a uniform procedure .  Good .  And see how well they do .  And give them freedom to to indicate if it 's just not workable .  Yeah ,  OK ,  excellent .  Yeah ,  yeah .  OK .  Alright .  That 's great .  Oh , interesting .  OK ,  alright .  Digits .  OK , so we read the transcript number first ,  right ?  Uh , quarter to four .  Mm - hmm .

Bmr020.D,"There 's gonna be some zeros from this morning 's meeting because I noticed that  Barry , I think maybe you turned your mike off before the digits were  Oh ,  was it during digits ?  Oh , so it doesn't matter .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And then she said "" Did I say three ?  I meant four . ""  Yeah , I just wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers or something .

About  Uh - huh .  Hmm .  It made me think about a cool little device that could be built  to  uh  to handle those people that call you on the phone and just like to talk and talk and talk .

Is it i d y is it  But after we 've done Thilo 's thing .  Mm - hmm .  They just do that on the main channels .  OK .  So , now Jane , my question is when they 're all done adjusting the w time boundaries for the dominant speaker , have they then also erased the time boundaries for the other ones ?  So how will we know who  Mm - hmm .  OK .  So she does the adjustments on those guys ?  Mm - hmm .  So if you don't have to adjust the bins , why not just do what it for all the channels ?

Bmr020.D,"So in fact this might suggest an alternative sort of a a c a hybrid between these two things .  So the the one suggestion is you know we we run Thilo 's thing  and then we have somebody go and adjust all the time boundaries  and we send it to IBM .  The other one is we just run his thing and send it to IBM .  There 's a a another possibility if we find that there are some problems ,  and that is if we go ahead and we just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file .

And it just You know , there 's a little interface which will for all the "" yes "" - es it then that will be the final beep file .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I mean it wouldn't be that much fun for a transcriber to sit there , hear it , beep , yes or no .  But it would be quick .  But there 's no adjusting .  And that 's what 's slow .  There 's no adjusting of time boundaries .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  They they  Yeah .  That 's true .  We can just catch it at the catch everything at this side .  Well maybe that 's the best way to go ,  just  Yeah .  We won't be able to s include it with this first thing ,  because there 's a part of the process of the beep file which requires knowing the normalization coefficients .

Bmr020.F,"notion of of how on a good meeting , how often uh , do you get segments that come in the middle of words and so forth ,  and uh in a bad meeting how often ?  Well he 's saying , you know , that the the EDU meeting was a good good meeting ,  right ?  Uh , and so so so it was almost it was almost always doing the right thing .  So I wanted to get some sense of what what almost always meant .  And then , uh in a bad meeting , or p some meetings where he said oh he 's had some problems , what does that mean ?  So I mean does one of the does it mean one percent and ten percent ?  Or does it mean five percent and fifty percent ?  Uh  Or Maybe percentage isn't the right word ,  but you know how many how many per minute ,  or  You know .  But I think that 's less of a problem .  They 'll just listen .  It 's just wasted time .  And th and that 's for a good meeting .  Now what about in a meeting that you said we 've you 've had some more trouble with ?  Right .  So I So i Sometime , we might wanna go back and look at it more in terms of how many times is there a spurt that 's that 's uh , interrupted ?  Something like that ?  And  Yeah again I I think that that is probably less of a problem  because if you 're if there 's If if a if a word is is split , then they might have to listen to it a few times to really understand that they can't quite get it .

So that , if any part of the word was overlapped , it was considered an interrupted word .  And then we looked at the the locatio the , um , you know , the features that the tags  because we had tagged these word strings , um , that that occurred right before these these uh , interrupt locations .

Uh , what else do we had .  Uh , repeated you know , repeated words is another of that kind of disfluencies and so forth .  So we had both the beginnings and ends of these  uh so , the end of a filled pause  and the end of a discourse marker .

We just looked at the distribution of words ,  and so every "" so yeah "" , and "" OK "" , uh , and "" uh - huh "" were were the were deemed to be backchannels  ","if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts a sentence , you know , where do these where do other people start their turns not turns really , but you know , sentences ,  So , the the question was how can we what can we say about the places where the second or or actually , several second speakers , um start their "" interrupts "" , as we call them .  to for for the purposes of this analysis , we tagged the word sequences , and and we time - aligned them .  So that , if any part of the word was overlapped , it was considered an interrupted word .  because we had tagged these word strings , um , that that occurred right before these these uh , interrupt locations .  And the tags we looked at are the spurt tag ,  or actually  End of spurt .  So whether there was a pause essentially here ,  and then we had things like discourse markers ,  uh , backchannels ,  uh , disfluencies .  uh , filled pauses  I mean we didn't really hand - tag all of these things .

So ,  and then we looked at the disti  so we looked at the distribution of these different kinds of tags , overall  uh , and and and particularly at the interruption points .  And uh , we found that there is a marked difference  so  that for instance after  so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted than before .  OK ?  And also of course after spurt ends ,  which means basically in p inside pauses .

OK , OK , OK ,  I have it here .  Uh , it 's the VAD plus the baseline actually .  I 'm talking about the the MFCC plus I do a frame dropping on it .  So that 's like the word error rate is like four point three .  Like Ten point seven .  It 's a medium misma  OK , sorry .  There 's a well ma well matched , medium mismatched , and a high matched .  So I don't have the like the  So  And forty forty .  Forty percent is the high mismatch .  And that becomes like four point three  Yeah ,  it 's like ten point one .  Still the same .

So the h well matched has like literally not changed by adding on - line or LDA on it .  But the  I mean , even the medium mismatch is pretty much the same .  And the high mismatch was improved by twenty percent absolute .  It 's the It - it 's Italian .  I 'm talking about Italian ,  yeah .  Mmm .  You have it ?  Yep .  So Thanks .  So ,  uh , this is the single stage Wiener filter ,  with The noise estimation was based on first ten frames .  Actually I started with using the VAD to estimate the noise  and then I found that it works  it doesn't work for Finnish and Spanish  because the VAD endpoints are not good to estimate the noise  because it cuts into the speech sometimes ,  so I end up overestimating the noise and getting a worse result .  So it works only for Italian by u for using a VAD to estimate noise .  It works for Italian because the VAD was trained on Italian .  So , uh  so this was , uh  And so this was giving  um ,  this this was like not improving a lot on this baseline of not having the Wiener filter on it .  And ,  so ,  uh , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it  ","uh , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it  ",
Bro023.B,"but the second time , what I did was I estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , uh , smoothing in the frequency to to reduce the variance  I mean , I have I 've I 've observed there are , like , a lot of bumps in the frequency when I do this Wiener filtering  which is more like a musical noise or something .  And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering , the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like ,  um  So , I still don't have the word error rate .  I 'm sorry about it .  But the overall improvement was like fifty - six point four six .  This was again using ten frames of noise estimate and two stage of Wiener filtering .  And the rest is like the LDA plu and the on - line normalization all remaining the same .  Uh ,  so this was , like , compared to , uh , uh Fifty - seven is what you got by using the French Telecom system ,  right ?  Y i  No ,  this is over the whole SpeechDat - Car .  So  point  Yeah ,  so the new the new Wiener filtering schema is like some fifty - six point four six  which is like one percent still less than what you got using the French Telecom system .  It 's very similar .  It 's it 's different in a sense like  I 'm actually cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum  which they 're not doing .  They 're d what they 're doing is , they have two stage stages of estimating the Wiener filter ,  but the final filter , what they do is they they take it to their time domain by doing an inverse Fourier transform .  And they filter the original signal using that fil filter ,  which is like final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up .  So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice ,  but the only thing is that the second time I 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level .  And so that that 's that 's what the difference is .  And actually I tried it on s the original clean I mean , the original spectrum where , like , I the second time I estimate the filter but actually clean up the noisy speech rather the c s first output of the first stage  and that doesn't seems to be a giving , I mean , that much improvement .  I I didn didn't run it for the whole case .  And  and what I t what I tried was , by using the same thing  but Uh ,  so we actually found that the VAD is very , like , crucial .  ","but the second time , what I did was I estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , uh , smoothing in the frequency to to reduce the variance  And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering , the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like ,  But the overall improvement was like fifty - six point four six .  ",
Bro023.B,"I mean , just by changing the VAD itself gives you the a lot of improvement  by instead of using the current VAD , if you just take up the VAD output from the channel zero , when instead of using channel zero and channel one ,  because that was the p that was the reason why I was not getting a lot of improvement for estimating the noise .  So I just used the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise so that it gives me some reliable mar markers for this noise estimation .  Um ,  so , it 's like  Yeah ,  the close - talking without  So because the channel zero and channel one are like the same speech , but only w I mean , the same endpoints .  But the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one ,  so you can actually use the output of the channel zero for channel one for the VAD .  I mean , that 's like a cheating method .  Yeah , that 's  Which is the channel zero .  But actually their alignment actually is not seems to be improving in like on all cases .  Yeah ,  which is  It gives like negative Well , in in like some Italian and TI - digits ,  right ?  Yeah .  So by using the endpointed speech , actually it 's worse than the baseline in some instances ,  which could be due to the word pattern .  Yeah , our neural net  Yeah , yeah .  Hmm .  OK ,  so  the Wiener filter , it 's it 's like it 's like you try to minimize  I mean , so the basic principle of Wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , uh , d uh , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal  if you have two channels .  Like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the noisy signal .  And then you try to minimize the error between these two .  So that 's the basic principle .  And you get  you can do that  I mean , if if you have only a c noisy signal , at a level which you , you w try to estimate the noise from the w assuming that the first few frames are noise  or if you have a w voice activity detector , uh , you estimate the noise spectrum .  And then you  Yeah .  in yeah , after the speech starts .  So  but that 's not the case in , uh , many many of our cases  but it works reasonably well .  And and then you What you do is you , uh b  fff .  So again ,  I can write down some of these eq  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  And then you do this  uh , this is the transfer function of the Wiener filter ,  ","I mean , so the basic principle of Wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , uh , d uh , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal  ",A number of the group also took time to explain the basics of their approaches to the group. 
Bro023.B,"so "" SF "" is a clean speech spectrum , power spectrum  And "" N "" is the noisy power spectrum .  And so this is the transfer function .  And ,  Yeah .  And then you multiply your noisy power spectrum with this .  You get an estimate of the clean power spectrum .  So  but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum , what you have .  So you estimate the NF from the initial noise portions  and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the SF .  So sometimes that becomes zero  because you do you don't have a true estimate of the noise .  So the f filter will have like sometimes zeros in it  because some frequency values will be zeroed out because of that .  And that creates a lot of discontinuities across the spectrum because @ @ the filter .  So ,  uh ,  so that 's what that was just the first stage of Wiener filtering that I tried .  It  Yeah .  Not seen .  They are very s similar techniques .  So it 's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction .  Yeah .  Uh , the reason was , like , we had this choice of using spectral subtraction , Wiener filtering , and there was one more thing which I which I 'm trying , is this sub space approach .  So ,  Stephane is working on spectral subtraction .  So I picked up  Y Yeah ,  we just wanted to have a few noise production compensation techniques  and then pick some from that  pick one .  VA Yeah , VAD .  w Yeah .  Yeah .  So  so one of one of the things that I tried , like I said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter .  Like , you estimate the edge of square  and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get , like , flattened out .  And that doesn't seems to be improving by trying it on the first time .  So what I did was like I p did this  and then you I plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time .  And that seems to be working .  So that 's where I got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on SpeechDat - Car with that .  And  So the other thing what I tried was I used still the ten frames of noise estimate  but I used this channel zero VAD to drop the frames .  So I 'm not still not estimating .  And that has taken the performance to like sixty - seven percent in SpeechDat - Car ,  ",,
Bro023.B,"which is which which like sort of shows that by using a proper VAD you can just take it to further , better levels .  And  So .  Yeah ,  so far I 've seen sixty - seven  I mean , no ,  I haven't seen s like sixty - seven percent .  And , uh ,  using the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise also seems to be improving  but I don't have the results for all the cases with that .  So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame ,  which is like , everywhere I use the channel zero VAD .  And that seems to be the best combination , uh , rather than using a few frames to estimate and then drop a channel .  Nnn ,  no .  This is just to test whether we can really improve by using a better VAD .  So ,  I mean So this is like the noise compensation f is fixed  but you make a better decision on the endpoints .  That 's , like seems to be  so we c  so I mean , which which means , like , by using this technique what we improve just the VAD  we can just take the performance by another ten percent or better .  So , that that was just the , uh , reason for doing that experiment .  And , w um  Yeah , but this all these things , I have to still try it on the TI - digits ,  which is like I 'm just running .  And there seems to be not improving a a lot on the TI - digits ,  so I 'm like investigating that , why it 's not .  And ,  um ,  um  Well after that .  So ,  uh  so the other the other thing is like I 've been I 'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum .  So  Tried this stuff on the mel as well  mel and the magnitude , and mel magnitude , and all those things .  But it seems to be the power spectrum seems to be getting the best result .  So , one of one of reasons I thought like doing the averaging , after the filtering using the mel filter bank , that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs .  So just th  Yeah ,  th that 's that 's the only thing that I could think of why why it 's giving improvement on the mel .  And , yep .  So that 's it .  Subspace , I 'm I 'm like that 's still in a little bit in the back burner  because I 've been p putting a lot effort on this to make it work , on tuning things and other stuff .  So  I was like going parallely  but not much of improvement .  I 'm just have some skeletons ready ,  ",,
Bro023.B,"need some more time for it .  Mmm .  Yep .  Yep .  Is that the log ?  After that .  No ,  after .  But you will  But you end up reducing some neighboring frequency bins @ @ in the average , right ?  When you add the negative to the positive value  which is the true estimate .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  That is true .  We just  Yeah .  For frames , frequency bins .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , the one you showed yesterday .  Right ?  Fff .  No , I don't have , for each ,  I I just just have the final number here .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  So so , no ,  I actually didn't give you the number which is the final one ,  which is , after two stages of Wiener filtering .  I mean , that was I just well , like the overall improvement is like fifty - six point five .  So ,  I mean , his number is still better than what I got in the two stages of Wiener filtering .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , OK .  Yeah , right ,  OK .  They use spectral subtraction ,  right .  French Telecom .  Oh , it 's it 's Wiener filtering .  Sorry .  Yeah , filtering .  Yeah , it 's not exactly Wiener filtering  but some variant of Wiener filtering .  Yeah .  s  They have like  yeah ,  th the just noise compensation technique is a variant of Wiener filtering ,  plus they do some some smoothing techniques on the final filter .  The th they actually do the filtering in the time domain .  So they would take this HF squared back , taking inverse Fourier transform .  And they convolve the time domain signal with that .  And they do some smoothing on that final filter , impulse response .  I mean , I 'm I 'm @ @ .  But .  It 's similar in the smoothing  and  Yeah .  Yeah .  The frequency domain .  No , you get it with Wiener filtering also .  Oh , no ,  you still end up with zeros in the s spectrum .  Sometimes .  Yeah .  Yeah , I know .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  yeah ,  the  Yep .  Yeah .  You mean , the m the mean is computed o based on some frames in the future also ?  Or or no ?  Mm - hmm .  I 'm sorry ,  why why is that delay coming ?  Like , you estimate the mean ?  Oh , yeah .  It isn't  OK ,  so it 's like it looks into the future also .  OK .  We can  OK .  We can do something in parallel also , in some like some cases like , if you wanted to do voice activity detection .  ",,
Bro023.B,"And we can do that in parallel with some other filtering you can do .  So you can make a decision on that voice activity detection  and then you decide whether you want to filter or not .  But by then you already have the sufficient samples to do the filtering .  So  So , sometimes you can do it anyway .  Yeah .  You mean , the the data , the super frame or something ?  Yeah , but that has a variable latency  because the last frame doesn't have any latency  and first frame has a twenty framed latency .  So you can't r rely on that latency all the time .  Because  I mean the transmission over over the air interface is like a buffer .  Twenty frame  twenty four frames .  So  But the only thing is that the first frame in that twenty - four frame buffer has a twenty - four frame latency .  And the last frame doesn't have any latency .  Because it just goes as  Yeah .  I used ten just ten frames .  Yeah , because  I mean , the reason was like in TI - digits I don't have a lot .  I had twenty frames most of the time .  Well , that 's that 's using the channel zero .  If I use a channel zero VAD to estimate the noise .  Which  Channel zero dropping .  Hmm .  t Oh , this  f  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So I 'm also using that n new noise estimate technique on this Wiener filtering what I 'm trying .  So I I have , like , some experiments running , I don't have the results .  So .  I don't estimate the f noise on the ten frames but use his estimate .  There 's  No .  So , it doesn't seems to help by their use of channel zero or channel one .  Uh , you mean their d the frame dropping , right ?  Yeah , it doesn't  Italian .  TI - digits .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  The energy also .  Yeah .  ",,
Bro023.C,"And uh Hans - uh , Hans - Guenter will be here , um , I think by next next Tuesday or so .  So he 's he 's going to be here for about three weeks ,  and ,  uh  Uh , we 'll see .  We might might end up with some longer collaboration or something .  So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing  and give us his his thoughts .  And so it 'll be another another good person looking at things .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Oh , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  No , he 'll be around for three weeks .  He 's , uh , um , very , very , easygoing ,  easy to talk to ,  and , uh , very interested in everything .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Yeah ,  yeah , he 's been here before .

Um ,  yeah , I mean , it was pretty it was pretty tiny .  Yeah .  But it but looking at it the other way , isn't it what you 're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training ,  if you were going to have a short time for  I mean , why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing .  Yeah .  No , total .  The other thing , um , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , um , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds ,  and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds ,  and when you were six  and you basically build up to the twelve seconds .  So that if you have very long utterances you have the best ,  but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can .  OK .  Yeah .  Right .  But I mean the other thing is that that 's  I mean , the other way of looking at this , going back to , uh , mean cepstral subtraction versus RASTA kind of things , is that you could look at mean cepstral subtraction ,  especially the way you 're doing it , uh , as being a kind of filter .  And so , the other thing is just to design a filter .  You know , basically you 're you 're you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort  and and just design a filter .  And then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior  ","And uh Hans - uh , Hans - Guenter will be here , um , I think by next next Tuesday or so .

So that if you have very long utterances you have the best ,  but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can .  ","There are hopes that a visitor coming for three weeks, may lead to a longer term collaboration. "
Bro023.C,"and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing .  And and , you know , it will , uh , if you have an IIR filter for instance , it will , um , uh , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get a long enough period ,  but , um ,  uh ,  by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back  because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors .  And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And , um  Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time .  I mean , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , uh , ramp up of a filter anyway .  And so you may may just want to think of it as a filter .  But , uh , if you do that , then , um , in practice somebody using the SmartKom system , one would think if they 're using it for a while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , uh , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a uh , over what , uh , you 'd get without this , uh , um , policy , uh , you get thirty percent .  And then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , uh , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing .  Well , I 'm saying in practice , yeah ,  that 's If somebody 's using a system to ask for directions or something ,  you know , they 'll say something first .  And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , "" excuse me ? ""  uh ,  or some  I mean it should have some policy like that anyway .  And and , uh ,  uh , in any event they might ask a second question .  And it 's not like what he 's doing doesn't , uh , improve things .  It does improve things ,  just not as much as he would like .  And so , uh , there 's a higher probability of it making an error , uh , in the first utterance .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Oh , the other thing I guess which which ,  uh ,  ",,
Bro023.C,"I don't know much about as much as I should about the rest of the system  but but , um ,  couldn't you , uh , if you if you sort of did a first pass  I don't know what kind of , uh , uh , capability we have at the moment for for doing second passes on on , uh , uh , some kind of little small lattice , or a graph , or confusion network , or something .  But if you did first pass with , um , the with either without the mean sub subtraction or with a a very short time one ,  and then , um , once you , uh , actually had the whole utterance in , if you did , um , the , uh , uh , longer time version then , based on everything that you had , um , and then at that point only used it to distinguish between , you know , top N , um , possible utterances or something , you you might it might not take very much time .  I mean , I know in the large vocabulary stu uh , uh , systems , people were evaluating on in the past , some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass  but other people didn't and had multiple passes .  And , um ,  the argument , um , against multiple passes was u u has often been "" but we want to this to be r you know have a nice interactive response "" .  And the counterargument to that which , say , uh , BBN I think had , was "" yeah ,  but our second responses are second , uh , passes and third passes are really , really fast "" .  So , um , if if your second pass takes a millisecond who cares ?  Um .  Yeah ,  so if it turned out to be a problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing , then , uh , one tactic is you know , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end stuff is to take in , um , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism ,  um , do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said .  And , uh , either in the form of an N - best list or in the form of a lattice , or or confusion network , or whatever .  And then the decoding of that is much , much faster or can be much , much faster if it isn't a big bushy network .  And you can decode that now with speech that you 've actually processed using this longer time , uh , subtraction .

Bro023.C,"So I mean , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass .  um , and again , if the second pass is really , really fast Uh , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff , um , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , uh , which have very low energy .  So , uh I mean , there 's lots of things you can do in second passes , at all sorts of levels .  Anyway , I 'm throwing too many things out .  But .  Is that using in combination with something else ?  With with a  No , no ,  but I mean in combination with our on - line normalization or with the LDA ?  Oh , OK .  So , does it g does that mean it gets worse ?  Or ?  Yeah ?  But that 's what I 'm confused about ,  cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering .  So I mean , if you can do all these in word errors it 's a lot a lot easier actually .  If you do all these in word error rates it 's a lot easier , right ?  OK ,  cuz then you can figure out the percentages .  Yeah .  So so  so what 's it start on ?  The MFCC baseline is is what ?  Is at what level ?  No , what 's what 's the number ?  Four point three .  What 's ten point seven ?  Ah .  Yeah .  OK ,  four point three ,  ten point seven ,  and  OK .  Not changed .  Eighteen point five .  And what were you just describing ?  But where 's the , uh , on - line normalization and so on ?  OK ,  and what kind of number  an and what are we talking about here ?  Is this TI - digits  or  Italian ?  And what did  So , what was the , um , uh , corresponding number , say , for , um , uh , the Alcatel system for instance ?  Do you know ?  OK .  OK .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But it 's a pretty similar number in any event .  Yeah .  But again , you 're you 're more or less doing what they were doing ,  right ?  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  What 's a channel zero VAD ?  I 'm I 'm confused about that .  Oh , oh , oh , oh .  Right .  I mean ,  ",Is that using in combination with something else ?  ,
Bro023.C,"so a are they going to pro  What are they doing to do ,  do we know yet ?  about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ?  So it 's not like that 's being done in one place or one time .  That 's that 's just a rule  and we 'd you you were permitted to do that .  Is is that it ?  Oh , so they will send files  so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  Yeah ,  c  Right  actually , I guess  Yeah .  It 's all pretty related ,  yeah .  It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise .  And it 's typically a mean square sense , uh uh uh , i in in in some way .  And , uh uh , spectral subtraction is is , uh uh , one approach to it .  I mean , in the long run you 're doing the same thing  but y but there you make different approximations ,  and in spectral subtraction , for instance , there 's a a an estimation factor .  You sometimes will figure out what the noise is  and you 'll multiply that noise spectrum times some constant and subtract that  rather than  and sometimes people  even though this really should be in the power domain , sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it works better .  And , uh , uh , you know .  I m I mean  yeah , I mean , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series .  So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them .  Um .  Yeah .  So I 'm I 'm still a little confused .  Is that channel zero information going to be accessible during this test .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yes .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Ma  Makes sense .  Uh , how about the subspace stuff ?  OK .  OK .  Oh !  Um , uh , what are you doing with negative , uh , powers ?  Right .  Yep , there 's all there 's all sorts of , uh , deviations from the ideal here .  I mean , for instance , you 're you 're talking about the signal and noise , um , at a particular point .  ","do we know yet ?  about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ?  Oh , so they will send files  so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ?  ","They also discusses topics relating to the rules and preferences of the project they are working on, including single vs multiple passes. "
Bro023.C,"And even if something is sort of stationary in ster terms of statistics , there 's no guarantee that any particular instantiation or piece of it is exactly a particular number or bounded by a particular range .  So , you 're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is .  Then you 're subtracting that from another chunk ,  and there 's absolutely no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , uh , be negative in some places .  Uh , on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made a mistake  because you certainly have stra subtracted a bigger number than is due to the noise .  Um Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated .  And that certainly makes sense in s in in a statistical interpretation , that , you know , over , um , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated  or assuming , uh , ergodicity that i that i um , across time , uh , it 's uncorrelated .  But if you just look at a quarter second , uh , and you cross - multiply the two things , uh , you could very well , uh , end up with something that sums to something that 's not zero .  So in fact , the two signals could have some relation to one another .  And so there 's all sorts of deviations from ideal in this .  And and given all that , you could definitely end up with something that 's negative .  But if down the road you 're making use of something as if it is a power spectrum , um , then it can be bad to have something negative .  Now , the other thing I wonder about actually is , what if you left it negative ?  What happens ?  I mean , because  Um , are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel ?  Right .  So the thing is , I wonder how if you put your thresholds after that , I wonder how often you would end up with , uh with negative values .  Yeah .  But nonetheless , uh , you know , these are it 's another f kind of smoothing , right ?  that you 're doing .  Right .  So , you 've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be ,  and now i then you 've subtracted it off .  And then after that , instead of instead of , uh , uh , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up .  Which is , you know , it 's there 's no particular reason that that 's the right thing to do either ,  right ?  So , um ,  uh ,  ",,
Bro023.C,"i in fact , what you 'd be doing is saying , "" well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation "" .  It 's just a thought .  I d I don't know if it would be  Nnn , yeah ,  although  Yeah ,  but that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noise , you left it .  Uh .  Yeah .  Well , yeah that 's that 's the opposite ,  yeah .  Yeah .  People can also , uh , reflect it back up and essentially do a full wave rectification instead of a instead of half wave .  But it was just a thought that that it might be something to try .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So these numbers he was giving before with the four point three , and the ten point one , and so forth , those were Italian , right ?  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  But do you have numbers in terms of word error rates on on Italian ? So just so you have some sense of reference ?  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  And this is , um , spectral subtraction plus what ?  On - line normalization and LDA ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah ,  plus , uh , I guess they have some sort of cepstral normalization , as well .  I mean , it 's not clear that these musical noises hurt us in recognition .  We don't know if they do .  I mean , they they sound bad .  But we 're not listening to it , usually .  Well , none of these systems , by the way , have I mean , y you both are are working with , um , our system that does not have the neural net ,  right ?  OK .  So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Maybe .  Yeah ,  it could do a nonlinear spectral subtraction  but I don't know if it  I mean , you have to figure out what your targets are .  Right .  Yeah , well , that 's not so much spectral subtraction then ,  but but but it 's but at any rate , yeah , people ,  uh  y yeah ,  in fact , we had visitors here who did that  I think when you were here ba way back when .  Uh ,  people d done lots of experimentation over the years with training neural nets .  And it 's not a bad thing to do .  It 's another approach .  M I mean , it 's it , um  ","Well , none of these systems , by the way , have I mean , y you both are are working with , um , our system that does not have the neural net ,  So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before .  ",
Bro023.C,"The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , um , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean  but then you get a different noise .  And the experiments we saw that visitors did here showed that it there was at least some , um , gentleness to the degradation when you switched to different noises .  It did seem to help .  So that you 're right ,  that 's another another way to go .  Oh , yeah ,  it did very well .  Yeah .  Um ,  but to some extent that 's kind of what we 're doing .  I mean , we 're not doing exactly that ,  we 're not trying to generate good examples  but by trying to do the best classifier you possibly can , for these little phonetic categories ,  It 's  Yeah ,  it 's kind of built into that .  And and that 's why we have found that it it does help .  Um  so ,  um ,  yeah , I mean , we 'll just have to try it .  But I I would I would I would imagine that it will help some .  I mean , it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same ,  but I would imagine it would help some .  So in any event , all of this I was just confirming that all of this was with a simpler system .  OK ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  It 's amazing how often that happens .  Mm - hmm .  One five ?  One five ?  Five zero ?  Five zero .  Yeah .  What if you just look into the past ?  How m by how much ?  By how much ?  Worse .  Hmm .  It 's depending on how all this stuff comes out  we may or may not be able to add any latency .  Um ,  s Yeah , I mean , I think the only thing is that  I would worry about it a little .  Because if we completely ignore latency , and then we discover that we really have to do something about it , we 're going to be find ourselves in a bind .  So , um ,  you know , maybe you could make it twenty - five .  You know what I mean ?  Yeah , just , you know , just be be a little conservative  because we may end up with this crunch where all of a sudden we have to cut the latency in half or something .  OK .  Well , in fact , everything is sent over in buffers cuz of  isn't it the TCP buffer some ?  Yeah ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And and that 's sort of one of the  all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee .

Uh , I think it never occurred to us to use a probability in there .  You could imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you added in was , uh , a function of the probability of it being s speech or noise .  Yeah .  Cuz that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , uh , this other estimate .  So it could be it could be interesting .

Bro023.D,"and subtract this estimation of the noise spectrum from the , uh , signal spectrum , but subtracting more when the SNR is is , uh , low ,  which is a technique that it 's often used .  So you overestimate the noise spectrum .  You multiply the noise spectrum by a factor , uh , which depends on the SNR .  So , above twenty DB ,  it 's one , so you just subtract the noise .  And then it 's b  Generally Well , I use , actually , a linear , uh , function of the SNR ,  which is bounded to , like , two or three , when the SNR is below zero DB .  Um , doing just this , uh , either on the FFT bins or on the mel bands , um , t doesn't yield any improvement  o  Yeah .  So there is also a threshold , of course ,  because after subtraction you can have negative energies ,  and  So what I I just do is to put , uh to to add to put the threshold first and then to add a small amount of noise ,  which right now is speech - shaped .  Um  Yeah ,  so it 's a it has the overall overall energy ,  uh  pow  it has the overall power spectrum of speech .  So with a bump around one kilohertz .  i  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  There can be frequency bins with negative values .  For each frequencies I a I 'm adding some , uh , noise ,  but the a the amount of the amount of noise I add is not the same for all the frequency bins .  Uh . Right now I don't think if it makes sense to add something that 's speech - shaped ,  because then you have silence portion that have some spectra similar to the sp the overall speech spectra .  But  Yeah .  So this is something I can still work on ,  but  Hmm .  That means that  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So so yeah , you have an an estimation of the noise spectrum ,  but sometimes , of course , it 's as the noise is not perfectly stationary ,  sometimes this estimation can be , uh , too small ,  so you don't subtract enough .

Bro023.D,"Well , actually I tried , something else based on this , um , is to to put some smoothing ,  um , because it seems to to help or it seems to help the Wiener filtering  and ,  mmm  So what I did is , uh , some kind of nonlinear smoothing .  Actually I have a recursion that computes  Yeah , let me go back a little bit .  Actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can , uh , find this this equivalent in the s in the spectral domain .  You can uh compute ,  y you can say that d your spectral subtraction is a filter ,  um , and the gain of this filter is the , um , signal energy minus what you subtract , divided by the signal energy .  And this is a gain that varies over time , and , you know , of course , uh , depending on the s on the noise spectrum and on the speech spectrum .  And  what happen actually is that during low SNR values , the gain is close to zero  but it varies a lot .  Mmm ,  and this this is the cause of musical noise and all these the the fact you we go below zero one frame and then you can have an energy that 's above zero .  And  Mmm .  So the smoothing is I did a smoothing actually on this gain , uh , trajectory .  But it 's the smoothing is nonlinear in the sense that I tried to not smooth if the gain is high ,  because in this case we know that , uh , the estimate of the gain is correct  because we we are not close to to to zero ,  um , and to do more smoothing if the gain is low .  Mmm .  Um .  Yeah .  So ,  well ,  basically that 's this idea ,  and it seems to give pretty good results ,  uh , although I 've just just tested on Italian and Finnish .  And on Italian it seems my result seems to be a little bit better than the Wiener filtering ,  right ?

Bro023.D,"But instead of double stage Wiener filtering , it 's it 's this smoothed spectral subtraction .  Um , yeah .  For what ?  It it 's Wiener filtering ,  am I right ?  Well , it 's some kind of Wiener filtering  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  But they also have two two different smoothing @ @ .  One in the time domain  and one in the frequency domain by just taking the first , um , coefficients of the impulse response .  So , basically it 's similar .  I mean , what you did , it 's similar  because you have also two two kind of smoothing .  One in the time domain ,  and one in the frequency domain ,  yeah .  Um  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , actually the the smoothing that I did do here reduced the musical noise .  Well , it  Mmm .  Well , I cannot you cannot hear beca  well , actually what I d did not say is that this is not in the FFT bins .  This is in the mel frequency bands .  Um  So ,  it could be seen as a f a a smoothing in the frequency domain because I used , in ad mel bands in addition and then the other phase of smoothing in the time domain .  Mmm .  But , when you look at the spectrogram , if you don't have an any smoothing , you clearly see , like in silence portions , and at the beginning and end of speech , you see spots of high energy randomly distributed over the the spectrogram .  Um  Which is musical noise ,  yeah ,  if if it If you listen to it  uh , if you do this in the FFT bins , then you have spots of energy randomly distributing .  And if you f if you re - synthesize these spot sounds as , like , sounds ,  uh  And  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Um  Yeah ,  although if if we , um , look at the result from the proposals , one of the reason , uh , the n system with the neural net was , um , more than well , around five percent better , is that it was much better on highly mismatched condition .  I 'm thinking , for instance , on the TI - digits trained on clean speech and tested on noisy speech .  Uh , for this case , the system with the neural net was much better .  But not much on the in the other cases .  And  if we have no , uh , spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , um , i the system is Uh , we thought the neural neural network is much better than before ,  even in these cases of high mismatch .

Um ,  Yeah , so this is th the , um  Well , actually , this was kind of the first try with this spectral subtraction plus smoothing ,  and I was kind of excited by the result .  Um , then I started to optimize the different parameters .  And ,  uh , the first thing I tried to optimize is the , um , time constant of the smoothing .  And it seems that the one that I chose for the first experiment was the optimal one ,  so uh ,  Um ,  so this is the first thing .  Um  Yeah , another thing that I it 's important to mention is , um , that this has a this has some additional latency .  Um .  Because when I do the smoothing , uh , it 's a recursion that estimated the means , so of the g of the gain curve .  And  this is a filter that has some latency .  And I noticed that it 's better if we take into account this latency .  So , instead o of using the current estimated mean to , uh , subtract the current frame , it 's better to use an estimate that 's some somewhere in the future .  Um  Yeah .  It 's the recursion ,  so it 's it 's the center recursion ,  right ?  Um  and the latency of this recursion is around fifty milliseconds .  Five zero ,  yeah .  Um ,  mmm .

Bro023.D,"um ,  there is uh , these parameters that I still have to to look at .  Like , I played a little bit with this overestimation factor ,  uh ,  but I still have to to look more at this ,  um ,  at the level of noise I add after . Uh , I know that adding noise helped , um , the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing ,  but I don't know right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one .  Same thing for the shape of the the noise .  Maybe it would be better to add just white noise instead of speech shaped noise .  Mm - hmm .  Um , yep .  Uh , and another thing is to  Yeah ,  for this I just use as noise estimate the mean , uh , spectrum of the first twenty frames of each utterance .  I don't remember for this experiment what did you use for these two stage  The ten frames ?  Mm - hmm .  Um .  But , so what 's this result you told me about , the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by t  Oh , OK .  But this is ten frames plus plus  channel  Uh , no ,  these results with two stage Wiener filtering is ten frames  but possibly more .  I mean , if channel one VAD gives you  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah ,  but in this experiment I did I didn't use any VAD .  I just used the twenty first frame to estimate the noise .  And So I expected it to be a little bit better , if , uh , I use more more frames .  Um .  OK , that 's it for spectral subtraction .  The second thing I was working on is to , um , try to look at noise estimation , mmm , and using some technique that doesn't need voice activity detection .  Um ,  and for this I u simply used some code that , uh , I had from from Belgium ,  which is technique that , um , takes a bunch of frame ,  um ,  and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy .  And then average these minima and take this as an an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band .  And there is something more to this actually .  What is done is that , uh , these minima are computed , um , based on , um , high resolution spectra .  So , I compute an FFT based on the long , uh , signal frame  which is sixty - four millisecond  What what I what I d uh , I do actually , is to take a bunch of to take a tile on the spectrogram  ","The second thing I was working on is to , um , try to look at noise estimation , mmm , and using some technique that doesn't need voice activity detection .  and for this I u simply used some code that , uh , I had from from Belgium ,  which is technique that , um , takes a bunch of frame ,  and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy .  And then average these minima and take this as an an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band .  ",A number of the group also took time to explain the basics of their approaches to the group. 
Bro023.D,"and this tile is five hundred milliseconds long and two hundred hertz wide .  And this tile  Uh , in this tile appears , like , the harmonics if you have a voiced sound ,  because it 's it 's the FTT bins .  And when you take the m the minima of of these this tile ,  when you don't have speech , these minima will give you some noise level estimate ,  If you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because the minima are between the harmonics .  And If you have other other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case ,  but if the time frame is long enough , uh , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , uh , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy .  Mmm ?  Sixty - four milliseconds is to compute the FFT , uh , bins .  The the FFT .  Um ,  actually it 's better to use sixty - four milliseconds because , um , if you use thirty milliseconds , then , uh , because of the this short windowing and at low pitch , uh , sounds , the harmonics are not , wha uh , correctly separated .  So if you take these minima , it b they will overestimate the noise a lot .  So I take to I take a bunch of these sixty - four millisecond frame to cover five hundred milliseconds ,  and then I look for the minima ,  on the on on the bunch of uh fifty frames , right ?  Mmm .  So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal ,  so if the the n the noise varies a lot , uh , you can track better track the noise ,  which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector .  So even if there are no no speech pauses , you can track the noise level .  The only requirement is that you must have , in these five hundred milliseconds segment , you must have voiced sound at least .  Cuz this these will help you to to track the the noise level .  Um .  So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , uh , noise estimate by this estimate ,  first on SpeechDat - Car  Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually .  And it 's , uh , slightly worse ,  like one percent relative compared to the VAD - based estimates .  Um ,  I think the reason why it 's not better , is that the SpeechDat - Car noises are all stationary .  Um .  So , u  y y there really is no need to have something that 's adaptive  ",,
Bro023.D,"and Uh ,  well , they are mainly stationary .  Um .  But , I expect s maybe some improvement on TI - digits  because , nnn , in this case the noises are all sometimes very variable .  Uh , so I have to test it .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  It 's  It 's the France - Telecom - based spectra , s uh , Wiener filtering and VAD .  So it 's their system  but just I replace their noise estimate by this one .  In i I 'm not  No , no .  Yeah ,  it 's our system  but with just the Wiener filtering from their system .  Right ?  Mmm .  Yeah .  Actually , th the best system that we still have is , uh , our system but with their noise compensation scheme ,  right ?  So I 'm trying to improve on this , and by by replacing their noise estimate by , uh , something that might be better .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But I di  Not yet ,  because I did this in parallel ,  and I was working on one and the other .  Um ,  Yeah , for for sure I will .  I can try also , mmm , the spectral subtraction .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Um .  Yeah .  I , um , also implemented a sp um spectral whitening idea  which is in the , um , Ericsson proposal .  Uh , the idea is just to um , flatten the log , uh , spectrum , um , and to flatten it more if the the probability of silence is higher .  So in this way , you can also reduce somewhat reduce the musical noise  and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes ,  because the the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions .  Um .  Yeah .  With this , no improvement ,  uh , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with  and ,  um  Actually , this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping  because , um , you could just put the threshold and say that "" below the threshold , I will flatten comp completely flatten the the spectrum "" .  And above this threshold , uh , keep the same spectrum .  So it would be like frame dropping ,  because during the silence portions which are below the threshold of voice activity probability , uh , w you would have some kind of dummy frame  which is a perfectly flat spectrum .  And this , uh , whitening is something that 's more soft because , um , you whiten you just , uh , have a function the whitening is a function of the speech probability ,  so it 's not a hard decision .  Um ,  ","Yeah .  Yeah , for for sure I will .  I can try also , mmm , the spectral subtraction .  ",
Bro023.D,"so I think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not sure about if it 's speech or silence ,  well , maybe it has something do with this .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , w  Yeah , right now it 's a constant that just depending on the the noise spectrum .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So .  Yeah .  Uh  Yeah , so there are with this technique there are some  I just did something exactly the same as as the Ericsson proposal  but , um , the probability of speech is not computed the same way .  And I think , i for yeah , for a lot of things , actually a g a good speech probability is important .  Like for frame dropping you improve , like you can improve from ten percent as Sunil showed , if you use the channel zero speech probabilities .  For this it might help ,  um  S so , yeah .  Uh ,  so yeah ,  the next thing I started to do is to , uh , try to develop a better voice activity detector .  And ,  um  I d  um  yeah , for this I think we can maybe try to train the neural network for voice activity detection on all the data that we have , including all the SpeechDat - Car data .  Um  And so I 'm starting to obtain alignments on these databases .  Um , and the way I mi I do that is that I just use the HTK system but I train it only on the close - talking microphone .  And then I aligned I obtained the Viterbi alignment of the training utterances .  Um  It seems to be ,  uh i  Actually what I observed is that for Italian it doesn't seem Th - there seems to be a problem .  Well .  Because  What ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  So , u but actually the VAD was trained on Italian also ,  so Um ,  the c the current VAD that we have was trained on , uh , t SPINE , right ?  Italian , and TI - digits with noise and  Uh , yeah .  And it seems to work on Italian but not on the Finnish and Spanish data .  So , maybe one reason is that s s Finnish and Spanish noise are different .  And  actually we observed we listened to some of the utterances and sometimes for Finnish there is music in the recordings and strange things ,  right ?  Um  Yeah , so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment to train on these databases ,  and , um ,  also to , um , try different kind of features , uh , as input to the VAD network .  And  ",,
Bro023.D,"we came up with a bunch of features that we want to try  like , um , the spectral slope , the , um , the degree o degree of voicing with the features that , uh , we started to develop with Carmen , um , e with , uh , the correlation between bands and different kind of features ,  and Yeah .

Bro023.E,"Th - that 's his spectral subtraction group ?  Is that right ?  Oh , OK .  So I guess I should probably talk to him a bit too ?  Oh , OK .

S so , um ,  the the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech ?  Or ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  I guess that 's it .

Um ,  so briefly , I 'm proposing to do a n a new p approach to speech recognition using um , a combination of , uh , multi - band ideas and ideas , um , about the uh , acoustic phonec phonetic approach to speech recognition .

Um , and the hope in all of this is that by going multi - band and by going into these , um intermediate classifications , that we can get a system that 's more robust to to unseen noises , and situations like that .  Um ,  and so ,  some of the research issues involved in this are , um , one , what kind of intermediate categories do we need to classify ?  Um , another one is um , what what other types of structures in these multi - band graphical models should we consider in order to um , combine evidence from the sub - bands ?  And , uh , the third one is how do we how do we merge all the , uh , information from the individual uh , multi - band classifiers to come up with word word recognition or or phone recognition things .

",
Bro024.B,"Mmm , @ @ .  Yeah .  But I actually stuck most of this in our m last meeting with Guenter .  Um ,  but I 'll just  Um ,  so the last week , uh , I showed some results with only SpeechDat - Car  which was like some fifty - six percent .  And , uh , I didn't h  I mean , I I found that the results  I mean , I wasn't getting that r results on the TI - digit .  So I was like looking into "" why , what is wrong with the TI - digits ? "" .  Why why I was not getting it .  And I found that , the noise estimation is a reason for the TI - digits to perform worse than the baseline .  So , uh , I actually , picked th  I mean , the first thing I did was I just scaled the noise estimate by a factor which is less than one to see if that because I found there are a lot of zeros in the spectrogram for the TI - digits when I used this approach .  So the first thing I did was I just scaled the noise estimate .  And I found  So the the results that I 've shown here are the complete results using the new  Well , the n the new technique is nothing but the noise estimate scaled by a factor of point five .  So it 's just an ad - hoc  I mean , some intermediate result , because it 's not optimized for anything .  So the results The trend the only trend I could see from those results was like the the p the current noise estimation or the , uh , noise composition scheme is working good for like the car noise type of thing .  Because I 've the only only p very good result in the TI - digits is the noise car noise condition for their test - A ,  which is like the best I could see that  uh , for any non - stationary noise like "" Babble "" or "" Subway "" or any "" Street "" , some "" Restaurant "" noise , it 's like it 's not performing w very well .  So ,  the So that that 's the first thing I c uh , I could make out from this stuff .  And  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh , and in that twenty percent @ @ it 's very inconsistent across different noise conditions .  So I have like a forty - five percent for "" Car noise ""  and then there 's a minus five percent for the "" Babble "" ,  and there 's this thirty - three for the "" Station "" .  And so it 's it 's not it 's not actually very consistent across .  So .  ","so the last week , uh , I showed some results with only SpeechDat - Car  which was like some fifty - six percent .  I mean , I wasn't getting that r results on the TI - digit .  So I was like looking into "" why , what is wrong with the TI - digits ? "" .

Bro024.B,"The only correlation between the SpeechDat - Car and this performance is the c stationarity of the noise that is there in these conditions and the SpeechDat - Car .  And , uh  so  so the overall result is like in the last page ,  which is like forty - seven ,  which is still very imbalanced because there are like fifty - six percent on the SpeechDat - Car and thirty - five percent on the TI - digits .  And  uh ,  ps the fifty - six percent is like comparable to what the French Telecom gets ,  but the thirty - five percent is way off .  Oh ,  yep .  Yeah .  For that 's for the clean training and the noisy testing for the TI - digits .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  No .  Yeah .  Uh , actually the noise compensation whatever , uh , we are put in it works very well for the high mismatch condition .  I mean , it 's consistent in the SpeechDat - Car  and in the clean training also it gives it  But this fifty percent is is that the the high mismatch performance equivalent to the high mismatch performance in the speech .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I do .  Yeah , yeah .  So by putting this noise  Yeah .  The reference drops like a very fast  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh  Oh . Yeah .  It 's not written anywhere .  Yeah , it 's TI - digits .  The first r spreadsheet is TI - digits .  The "" Car "" ?  Oh .  Still it still , uh that that 's still consistent .  I mean , I get the best performance in the case of "" Car "" , which is the third column in the A condition .  Uh  That 's the next next spreadsheet , is  So that is the performance for Italian , Finnish and Spanish .  Yeah .  Improvement .  That 's "" Percentage increase "" is the percentage improvement over the baseline .  So that 's  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  There 's there 's a  Which is there in the spreadsheet .  I 'm not changing anything in there .  So .  Uh ,  yeah .  So all the hi H M numbers are w very good ,  in the sense , they are better than what the French Telecom gets .  So .  But the the only number that 's still I mean , which Stephane also got in his result was that medium mismatch of the Finnish ,  which is very which is a very strange situation where we used the we changed the proto for initializing the HMM  I mean , this this is basically because it gets stuck in some local minimum in the training .  That seventy - five point seven nine in the Finnish mismatch which is that the eleven point nine six what we see .  Yeah .  Yeah  ",,
Bro024.B,"so we start with that different proto and it becomes eighty - eight ,  which is like some fifty percent improvement .  Different prototype ,  which is like a different initialization for the , uh , s transition probabilities .  It 's just that right now , the initialization is to stay more in the current state ,  which is point four point six , right ?  Yeah .  And if it changes to point five point five , which is equal @ @ for transition and self loop where it becomes eighty - eight percent .  Yeah .  We can't do it .  Yeah .  So .  Very s  It has a very few at uh , actually , c uh , tran I mean , words also .  It 's a very , very small set , actually .  So there is  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It has some music also .  I mean , very horrible music like like  I know .  Uh  So ,  that that 's the that 's about the results .  And , uh ,  the summary is like  OK .  So there are the other thing what I tried was , which I explained in the last meeting , is using the channel zero for , uh , for both dropping and estimating the noise .  And that 's like just to f n get a feel of how good it is .  I guess the fifty - six percent improvement in the SpeechDat - Car becomes like sixty - seven percent .  Like ten percent better .  But that 's that 's not a that 's a cheating experiment .  So .  That 's just  So ,  m  w  Yeah .  So we had forty - four percent in the first proposal .  Yeah .  We have f a big im  So the major improvement that we got was in all the high mismatch cases ,  because all those numbers were in sixties and seventies  because we never had any noise compensations .  So that 's where the biggest improvement came up .  Not much in the well match and the medium match and TI - digits also right now .  So this is still at three or four percent improvement over the first proposal .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  yeah .  So .  Yes .  Stephane also has the same experience of using the spectral subtraction right ?  Yeah .  So here here I mean , I found that it 's if I changed the noise estimate I could get an improvement .  So that 's so it 's something which I can actually pursue , is the noise estimate .  And  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Th - That 's true . Yeah  the c the models are not complex enough to absorb that additional variability that you 're introducing .  Well , that 's  Yeah .  So  It 's  ",,
Bro024.B,"Mm - hmm .  Very different from speech .  Still , I mean , it shouldn't confuse the  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah  the that 's true .  That those those regions are the cause for this @ @ those negative values or whatever you get .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  So  Yep .  C - z C - zero and log energy also ,  yeah .  Now ?  Oh .  Yeah  the the log energy , the after the clean cleaning up .  So they add a random random noise to it .  No .  On - only to the log energy .

And then the final log energy that they that they get , that to the to that they add some random noise .  Yeah .  So it 's not the mel .  You know , it 's not the mel filter bank output .  These are log energy computed from the time s domain signal ,  not from the mel filter banks .  So  did  Becomes flat .  The variance , yeah , reduces ,  so .  Hmm , yeah .  Yeah .  Although  Uh ,  so the  OK .  So the other thing is the I 'm just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond .  So I just just tried another sk system I mean , another filter which I 've like shown at the end .  Which is very similar to the existing uh , filter .  Only Uh , only thing is that the phase is is like a totally nonlinear phase  because it 's a it 's not a symmetric filter anymore .  Yeah  so so this this is like So this makes the delay like zero for LDA  because it 's completely causal .  So  So I got actually just the results for the Italian for that  and that 's like  So the fifty - one point O nine has become forty - eight point O six ,  which is like three percent relative degradation .  So I have like the fifty - one point O nine  and  So .  I don't know it f fares for the other conditions .  So it 's just like it 's like a three percent relative degradation ,  with the  u Uh , may  The French Telecom .  Thirty - four .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So if they include the delta , it will be an additional forty millisecond .

Bro024.B,"So  That 's the way the the the frames are packed ,  like you have to wait for one more frame to pack .  Because it 's the CRC is computed for two frames always .  No .  They actually changed the compression scheme altogether .  So they have their own compression and decoding scheme  and they I don't know what they have .  But they have coded zero delay for that .  Because they ch I know they changed it ,  their compression .  They have their own CRC ,  their their own error correction mechanism .  So they don't have to wait more than one more frame to know whether the current frame is in error .  So they changed the whole thing so that there 's no delay for that compression and part also .  Even you have reported actually zero delay for the compression .  I thought maybe you also have some different  OK .  Ah .  Mm - hmm .  Thanks .  No .  So that threshold  OK .

Bro024.B,"So by uh , by by reducing the noise a a decent threshold like minus thirty DB , it 's like Uh , you are like r r reducing the floor of the noisy regions , right ?  Uh - huh .

Bro024.C,"Mm - hmm .  OK .  Um ,  so , yeah , the this past week I 've been main mainly occupied with , um , getting some results , u from the SRI system trained on this short Hub - five training set for the mean subtraction method .  And , um ,  I ran some tests last night .  But , um ,  c  the results are suspicious .

Bro024.C,"yeah , I wou I would be curious about people 's feedback on this  cuz I 'm @ @ I p I think there are some I think it 's it 's kind of like a a bit of a tricky engineering problem .  I 'm trying to figure out what 's the optimal way to set this up .  So , um , I 'll try to make the plots and then put some postscript up on my on my web page .  And I 'll mention it in my status report if people wanna take a look .  w Well , it c  I I don't think it it 's just for any mismatch you take a hit .  i In some cases it might be u better to have a mismatch .  Like I think I saw something like like if you only have two seconds in test , or , um , maybe it was something like four seconds , you actually do a little better if you , um , train on six seconds than if you train on four seconds .  Um ,  but the case , uh with the point three percent hit was using six seconds in test , um , comparing train on twelve seconds versus train on six seconds .  The train on twelve seconds .  On The the the accuracies w went from it was something vaguely like ninety - five point six accuracy , um , improved to ninety - five point nine wh when I  OK .  OK .  Huh .  That 's that 's interesting .  Alright , the e uh , I see your point .  I guess I was thinking of it as , um , an interesting research problem .  The how to g I was thinking that for the ASRU paper we could have a section saying , "" For SmartKom , we we d in we tried this approach in , uh , interactive system "" , which I don't think has been done before .  And and then there was two research questions from that .  And one is the k does it still work if you just use the past history ?  Alright ,  and the other was this question of , um what I was just talking about now .  So I guess that 's why I thought it was interesting .  Yeah ,  um .  Oh , o Oh , OK .  So that 's that 's that 's standard .  Um  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  OK .  And , um ,  Let 's l let 's see .  Um ,  OK .  And then there 's um , another thing I wanna start looking at , um , wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length .  So I 've just been using two seconds  just because that 's what Carlos did before .  Uh , I wrote to him asking about he chose the two seconds .  ","And then there 's um , another thing I wanna start looking at , um , wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length .  ","While on these topics, related areas discussed included recognition window length, training versus test set sizes, artificial distortion and latency concerns. "
Bro024.C,"And it seemed like he chose it a bit informally .  So , um ,  with the with the HTK set - up I should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length ,  say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions ,  um , say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse responses we have for reverberation ,  just , um , making some plots and seeing how they look .  And , um ,  so ,  with the the sampling rate I was using , one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um , number of samples  and , um , I 'll I 'll jus f for the ones in between I guess I 'll just zero - pad .  Oh .  Huh .  Uh , yeah ,  I don't I don't think the TI - digits data that I have , um , i is would be appropriate for that .  But what do you What about if I w I fed it through some kind of , um , speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate ?  Yeah .  Well , uh , just if you think it 's worth looking into .  I mean , it it is getting a little away from reverberation .  Yeah .  Right .  And and th the third thing , um , uh , is , um , Barry explained LDA filtering to me yesterday .  And so , um , Mike Shire in his thesis um , did a a series of experiments , um , training LDA filters in d on different conditions .

Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Uh - huh .  Huh .  o OK .  So , um ,  a actually I was just thinking about what I was asking about earlier , wi which is about having less than say twelve seconds in the SmartKom system to do the mean subtraction .  You said in systems where you use cepstral mean subtraction , they concatenate utterances  and , do you know how they address this issue of , um , testing versus training ?  Can  OK .  Um  OK ,  um ,  and , um , so so in tha in that case , wh what do they do when they 're t um , performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data ?  So because you 'd have hours and hours of training data .  So do they cut it off and start over ?  At intervals ?  Or ?  Oh , well , no .  I guess not .  But  OK .  But it 's  OK .

Bro024.C,"So if someone 's interacting with the system , though , uh , Morgan uh , Morgan said that you would tend to , um , chain utterances together  um , r  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  I g I guess the question I had was , um , amount of data e u was the amount of data that you 'd give it to , um update this estimate .  Because say you if you have say five thousand utterances in your training set , um , and you you keep the mean from the last utterance ,  by the time it gets to the five thousandth utterance  OK ,  so so so they would  g s  r and it  right .  OK ,  so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker .  Yeah ,  OK .  R right .  Right ,  OK .  I see .  Bec - because I so this SmartKom task first off , it 's this TV and movie information system .  And  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  I I see .  I was I was about to say . So if if you ask it "" What what movies are on TV tonight ? "" ,  if I look at my wristwatch when I say that it 's about two seconds .  The way I currently have the mean subtraction , um , set up , the the analysis window is two seconds .

And which was worse ?  OK .  But point three percent , uh , w from what to what ?  That 's point three percent  So four point four to four point one .  So yeah .  So about a about an eight percent , uh , seven or eight percent relative ?  Uh ,  Yeah .  Well , I think in a p You know , if if you were going for an evaluation system you 'd care .  But if you were doing a live system that people were actually using nobody would notice .  It 's uh , I think the thing is to get something that 's practical , that that you could really use .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I mean , a short - time FFT short - time cepstrum calculation , uh , mean u mean calculation work that people have in commercial systems , they do this all the time .  They the they calculate it from previous utterances and then use it , you know .  But but , uh ,  as you say , there hasn't been that much with this long long - time , uh , spectra work .  Uh ,  Yeah .  Pretty common .  Yeah .  Um ,  but , u uh ,  yes .  No , it is interesting .  And the other thing is , I mean , there 's two sides to these really small , uh , gradations in performance .  Um , I mean , on the one hand in a practical system if something is , uh , four point four percent error , four point one percent error , people won't really tell be able to tell the difference .  On the other hand , when you 're doing , uh , research , you may , eh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety - five percent accurate system to a ninety - eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent .

Bro024.D,"So so the they they it 's I don't mean to say that they 're they 're irrelevant .  Uh , they are relevant .  But , um , i for a demo , you won't see it .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds .  Um ,  and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance .  You know , if you if if if there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things ,  and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more .  So  I don't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech  but it might make a difference .  I don't know .  Yeah , probably not .  Yeah .  Yeah , but then you 'll have the degradation of of , uh , whatever you do uh , added onto that .  But maybe .  Yeah ,  maybe if you get something that sounds that that 's does a pretty job at that .  You could imagine that .  Um , yeah .  It 's just that you 're making a choice  uh , I was thinking more from the system aspect , if you 're making a choice for SmartKom , that that that it might be that it 's it c the optimal number could be different , depending on  Could be .  I don't know .  I guess , the the the issue I was the general issue I was bringing up was that if you 're have a moving moving window , uh , a wa a a set of weights times things that , uh , move along , shift along in time , that you have in fact a linear time invariant filter .  And you just happened to have picked a particular one by setting all the weights to be equal .  And so the issue is what are some other filters that you could use , uh , in that sense of "" filter "" ?  And , um ,  as I was saying , I think the simplest thing to do is not to train anything , but just to do some sort of , uh , uh , hamming or Hanning , uh , kind of window , kind of thing ,  just sort of to de - emphasize the jarring .  So I think that would sort of be the first thing to do .  But then , yeah , the LDA i uh , is interesting because it would sort of say well , suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion ,  what would the filter look like then ?  ","I guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds .  and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance .

Bro024.D,"Uh ,  and , um ,  that 's sort of what we 're doing in this Aur - Aurora stuff .  And , uh ,  it 's still not clear to me in the long run whether the best thing to do would be to do that or to have some stylized version of the filter that looks like these things you 've trained up , because you always have the problem that it 's trained up for one condition and it isn't quite right for another .  So .  uh that 's that 's why that 's why RASTA filter has actually ended up lasting a long time ,  people still using it quite a bit , because y you don't change it .  So  doesn't get any worse .  Uh ,  Anyway .  Go ahead .  Well , I think what I was s I thought what I was saying was that , um , at any given point you are gonna start off with what you had from before .  From  and so if you 're splitting things up into utterances  So , for instance , in a dialogue system , where you 're gonna be asking , uh , you know , th for some information , there 's some initial th something .  And , you know , the first time out you you might have some general average .  But you you d you don't have very much information yet .  But at after they 've given one utterance you 've got something .  You can compute your mean cepstra from that ,  and then can use it for the next thing that they say ,  uh ,  so that , you know , the performance should be better that second time .  Um ,  and I think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training I 'm sure vary from place to place .  But I think the ideally , it seems to me anyway , that you you would wanna do the same thing in training as you do in test .  But that 's that 's just , uh , a prejudice .  And I think anybody working on this with some particular task would experiment .  No , but those are all different people with different I mean , i in y  So for instance , in in the in a telephone task , these are different phone calls .  So you don't wanna @ @ chain it together from a from a different phone call .  So it 's within speaker ,  within phone call ,  if it 's a dialogue system , it 's within whatever this characteristic you 're trying to get rid of is expected to be consistent over ,  right ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Now , you know , maybe you 'd use something from the others  just because at the beginning of a call you don't know anything ,  ","and so if you 're splitting things up into utterances  So , for instance , in a dialogue system , where you 're gonna be asking , uh , you know , th for some information , there 's some initial th something .  and I think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training I 'm sure vary from place to place .

Bro024.D,"and so you might have some kind of general thing that 's your best guess to start with .  But  So , s I I  you know , a lot of these things are proprietary  so we 're doing a little bit of guesswork here .  I mean , what do comp what do people do who really face these problems in the field ?  Well , they have companies  and they don't tell other people exactly what they do .  But but I mean , when you the the hints that you get from what they when they talk about it are that they do they all do something like this .  Yeah , but you might have somebody who 's using it  and then later you might have somebody else who 's using it .  And so you 'd wanna set some  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well ,  w OK ,  so in that situation , though , th maybe what 's a little different there , is I think you 're talking about there 's only one  it it it also depends  we 're getting a little off track here .  r But but but  Uh , there 's been some discussion about whether the work we 're doing in that project is gonna be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both .  And I think for this kind of discussion it matters .  If it 's in the kiosk , then the physical situation is the same .  It 's gonna you know , the exact interaction of the microphone 's gonna differ depending on the person and so forth .  But at least the basic acoustics are gonna be the same .  So f if it 's really in one kiosk , then I think that you could just chain together and and you know , as much as much speech as possible to  because what you 're really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic .  But in in the case of the mobile , uh , presumably the acoustic 's changing all over the place .  And in that case you probably don't wanna have it be endless because you wanna have some sort of it 's it 's not a question of how long do you think it 's you can get an approximation to a stationary something , given that it 's not really stationary .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Or subtract nothing .  I mean , it 's  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah , people do something .  They they , uh , they have some , um ,  uh ,  in in cepstral mean subtraction , for short - term window analysis windows , as is usually done , you 're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic .  ",,
Bro024.D,"And so , uh , if you have any other information about what a general kind of characteristic would be , then you you can do it there .  Yeah ,  that 's  Yeah .  The other thing is that and and I I remember B B N doing this , is that if you have a multi - pass system , um , if the first pass ta it takes most of the computation , the second and the third pass could be very , very quick ,  just looking at a relatively small n small , uh , space of hypotheses .  Then you can do your first pass without any subtraction at all .  And then your second pass , uh , uh , eliminates those most of those hypotheses by , uh by having an improved improved version o of the analysis .  So .  Yeah .  Yes , briefly .  Oh , I thought you were finishing your thesis in two weeks .  Yeah .  I 'm sort of confused  but  this  I 'm looking on the second page ,  and it says "" fifty percent ""  looking in the lower right - hand corner ,  "" fifty percent relative performance "" .  Is that  is that fifty percent improvement ?  So it 's improvement over the baseline mel cepstrum ?  But the baseline mel cepstrum under those training doesn't do as well  I I 'm I 'm trying to understand why it 's it 's eighty percent  That 's an accuracy number , I guess ,  right ?  So that 's not as good as the one up above .  But the fifty is better than the one up above ,  so I 'm confused .  Oh .  Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .  I see .  I see .  This is this is TI digits we 're looking at ?  This whole page is TI - digits  or this is ?  Mmm .  How does clean training do for the , uh , "" Car ""  stuff ?  No .  I mean , this is added noise .  I mean , this is TI - digits .  I 'm sorry .  I meant in in the in the , uh , multi - language , uh , uh , Finnish and  "" Training condition ""  Oh , right .  So "" clean "" corresponds to "" high mismatch "" .  And "" increase "" ,  That 's increase e  Which means decrease in word error rate ?  OK ,  so "" percentage increase "" means decrease ?  OK .  Yeah .  Alright .  Uh - huh .  So we have to jiggle it somehow ?  S Wait a minute .  Start with a different what ?  Uh - huh .  So maybe for that one you need a much smarter VAD ?  Mmm ,  if it 's music .  Yeah , so that 's good .  ",,
Bro024.D,"Then if we can improve the noise estimation , then it should get better .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  We probably should at some point here try the tandem the the the system - two kind of stuff with this , with the spectral subtraction for that reason .  Cuz again , it should do a transformation to a domain where it maybe looks more Gaussian .  Mm - hmm .  But isn't that s again sort of the idea of the additive thing ,  if it as as we had in the J stuff ?  I mean , basically if if you have random data , um , in in the time domain , then when you look at the s spectrum it 's gonna be pretty flat .  And and ,  uh ,  so just add something everywhere rather than just in those places .  It 's just a constant , right ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , see if you add something everywhere , it has almost no effect up up up on on top .  And it and it and it has significant effect down there .  That was , sort of the idea .  I think when it 's noisy people should just speak up .  Oh , they do !  Oh .  Hmm .  To the l  To the just the energy , or to the mel uh , to the mel filter ?  Oh .  So it Cuz I mean , I think this is most interesting for the mel filters .  Right ?  Or or F F  one or the other .  Yeah , but again , that 's just log energy as opposed to filter bank energy .

Th - Well , this is  This is  So So , basically our our position is that , um , we shouldn't be unduly constraining the latency at this point  because we 're all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise .

Bro024.D,"But , again , we 're the the approaches that we 're using are ones that take advantage of  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , that the they would need that forty milliseconds also .  Right ?  Oh .  Oh .  Oh , OK .  Hmm .  Oh .  Wait a minute .  It 's  Wait a minute .  I think I 'm confused .  Alright .

So when you say minus twenty - five or minus thirty DB , with respect to what ?  OK ,  so basically you 're creating a signal - to - noise ratio of twenty - five or thirty DB ?  uh r  But did you do that before the thresholding to zero ,  or ?  Oh ,  so you 'd really want to do it before ,  right ?  Yeah ,  because then the then you would have less of that phenomenon .  I think .  c  Yeah ,  it it  Right .  Yeah , that will reduce the variance .  That 'll help .  But maybe if you does do it before you get less of these funny - looking things he 's drawing .

Bro024.E,"Hello .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , if we look at the figures on the right , we see that the reference system is very bad .  Like for clean clean training condition .  Nnn .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I also have the feeling that um , the reason ye why it doesn't work is yeah , that the models are much are t um , not complex enough .  Because I actually I als always had a good experience with spectral subtraction ,  just a straight spectral subtraction algorithm when I was using neural networks , big neural networks , which maybe are more able to model strange distributions  and  But  Yeah .

Mm - hmm .  If we look at the France Telecom proposal , they use some kind of noise addition .  They have a random number generator , right ?  And they add noise on the trajectory of , uh , the log energy only , right ?  Yeah .  Um ,  But I don't know how much effect it this have ,  but they do that .  Yeah .

Um  Mm - hmm .  Only  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Maybe it 's just a way to decrease the importance of this particular parameter in the in the world feature vector  cu if you add noise to one of the parameters , you widen the distributions  and  Eee - sss - uh .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Where does the comprish compression in decoding delay comes from ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I can go next .  Yeah .  Mmm .

Bro024.E,"because I don't want to  In the proposal  Well , in in the system we want to add like speech frame before every word and a little bit of of , uh , s a couple of frames after also .  Uh , but to estimate the performance of the VAD , we don't want to do that ,  because it would artificially increase the um the false alarm rate of speech detection .  Right ?  Um ,  so ,  there is u normally a figure for the Finnish and one for Italian .  And maybe someone has two for the Italian  because I 'm missing one figure here .  Well  Well , whatever .  Uh Yeah , so one surprising thing that we can notice first is that apparently the speech miss rate is uh , higher than the false alarm rate .  So .  It means  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , there are two curves .  One curve 's for the close - talking microphone , which is the lower curve .  And the other one is for the distant microphone  which has more noise  so ,  it 's logical that it performs worse .  So as I was saying , the miss rate is quite important  uh , which means that we tend to label speech as as a silence .  And ,  uh , I didn't analyze further yet ,  but I think it 's it may be due to the fricative sounds  which may be in noisy condition maybe label labelled as silence .  And it may also be due to the alignment  because  well , the reference alignment .  Because right now I just use an alignment obtained from from a system trained on channel zero .  And  I checked it a little bit  but there might be alignment errors .  Um , yeah ,  e  like the fact that the the models tend to align their first state on silence and their last state o on silence also .  So the reference reference alignment would label as speech some silence frame before speech and after speech .  This is something that we already noticed before  when  mmm ,  So this cus this could also explain , uh , the high miss rate maybe .  Uh  Yeah .  Right .  Um  Yeah ,  and the different points of the curves are for five uh , thresholds on the probability uh from point three to point seven .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So the v  The VAD ?  Yeah .  There first , a threshold on the probability @ @ That puts all the values to zero or one .  And then the median filtering .  Yeah .  It 's fixed ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  So , going from channel zero to channel one , uh , almost double the error rate .  Um ,  Yeah .  ",,
Bro024.E,"Well , so it 's a reference performance that we can you know , if we want to to work on the VAD , we can work on this basis  and  Yeah .  It 's a very big one .  I don't remember .  m  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Uh , ppp .  I don't know , you have questions about that , or suggestions ?  It seems the performance seems worse in Finnish ,  which  uh  It 's not trained on Finnish ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  And  And also there are like funny noises on Finnish  more than on Italian .  I mean , like music  and um  So , yeah ,  we were looking at this .  But for most of the noises , noises are  um ,  I don't know if we want to talk about that .  But ,  well , the the "" Car "" noises are below like five hundred hertz .  And we were looking at the "" Music "" utterances  and in this case the noise is more about two thousand hertz .  Well , the music energy 's very low apparently .  Uh ,  uh , from zero to two two thousand hertz .  So maybe just looking at this frequency range for from five hundred to two thousand would improve somewhat the VAD  and  Mmm  Yeah ,  but  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , the next ,  um  Oh , it 's there .  Yeah .  No .  It 's not .  It 's it was trained on some alignment obtained  um ,  uh For the Italian data , I think we trained the neural network on with embedded training .  So re - estimation of the alignment using the neural network , I guess .  That 's right ?  Yeah .  So it was a f f a phonetic classification system for the Italian Aurora data .  For the Aurora data that it was trained on , it was different .  Like , for TI - digits you used a a previous system that you had , I guess .  So the alignments from the different database that are used for training came from different system .  Then we put them tog together .  Well , you put them together and trained the VAD on them .  Mmm .  Uh ,  But did you use channel did you align channel one also ?  Or  Yeah .  So di  Yeah .  So the alignments might be wrong then on channel one , right ?  So we might ,  yeah ,  at least want to retrain on these alignments ,  which should be better because they come from close - talking microphone .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  Um .  And eh , hhh  actually when we look at at the VAD , for some utterances it 's almost perfect ,  ",,
Bro024.E,"I mean , it just dropped one frame ,  the first frame of speech  or  So there are some utterances where it 's almost one hundred percent VAD performance .  Uh ,  but Yeah .  Mmm  Yep .  So the next thing is um , I have the spreadsheet for three different system .  But for this you only have to look right now on the SpeechDat - Car performance  uh , because I didn't test  so I didn't test the spectral subtraction on TI - digits yet .  Uh , so you have three she sheets .  One is the um proposal - one system .  Actually , it 's not exe exactly proposal - one .  It 's the system that Sunil just described .  Um ,  but with uh , Wiener filtering from um , France Telecom included .  Um , so this gives like fifty - seven point seven percent , uh , s uh , error rate reduction on the SpeechDat - Car data .  Mmm ,  and then I have two sheets where it 's for a system where  uh ,  so it 's again the same system .  But in this case we have spectral subtraction  with a maximum overestimation factor of two point five .  Uh , there is smoothing of the gain trajectory with some kind of uh , low - pass filter ,  which has forty milliseconds latency .  And then , after subtraction um , I add a constant to the energies  and I have two cases d where The first case is where the constant is twenty - five DB below the mean speech energy  and the other is thirty DB below .  Um ,  and for these s two system we have like fifty - five point , uh , five - percent improvement ,  and fifty - eight point one .  So again , it 's around fifty - six , fifty - seven .  Uh  Yeah , because I didn't  For the France Telecom uh , spectral subtraction included in the our system , the TI - digits number are the right one ,  but not for the other system  because I didn't test it yet this system , including with spectral subtraction on the TI - digits data .

So ,  maybe  maybe we might do it before ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Uh  Yeah .  But still , when you do this and you take the log after that , it it reduce the the variance .  But  Mmm ,  Um ,  ",,
Bro024.E,"We would  Mm - hmm .  Um .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , it 's clear .  I should have gi given other results .  Also it 's clear when you don't add noise , it 's much worse .  Like , around five percent worse I guess .  And if you add too much noise it get worse also .  And it seems that right now this this is c a constant that does not depend on on anything that you can learn from the utterance .  It 's just a constant noise addition .  Um .  And I I think w w  I think  Yeah ,  so the way I did that , i I just measured the average speech energy of the all the Italian data .  And then I I have I used this as mean speech energy .

It stays In this range ,  it 's , uh , the p u  well , the performance of the this algorithm is quite good .  But for Finnish , you have a degradation already when you go from thirty - five to thirty  and then from thirty to twenty - five .  And I have the feeling that maybe it 's because just Finnish has a mean energy that 's lower than than the other databases .  And due to this the thresholds should be  the the a the noise addition should be lower  and  Yeah .  So  It 's not .  It 's just something that 's fixed .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Um  Yeah , so I g  No .  It No .  Because I did it I started working on Italian .  I obtained this average energy  and then I used this one .  Yeah .  Yep .

But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth ,  um , that arguably , you 're c  and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand .

Bro025.B,"stationary dealing with e e  we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise .  And now we do .  Well , so so so argu arguably , I mean , what we should do  I mean , I gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on .  But and then but , um , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things ,  th these things I would guess ,  and not change that .

But I would I would I would thought think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while  because what 'll happen is we 'll change many other things in the system ,  and then we 'll probably wanna come back to this and possibly make some other choices .  But , um .  Well , depending on its size  Well , one question is , is it on the , um , server side or is it on the terminal side ?  Uh , if it 's on the server side , it you probably don't have to worry too much about size .  So that 's kind of an argument for that .  We do still , however , have to consider its latency .  So the issue is is , um , for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ?  Um , what we 've done in uh in the past is to use the neural net , uh , to transform , um , all of the features that we use .  So this is done early on .  This is essentially , um , um I guess it 's it 's more or less like a spee a speech enhancement technique here  right ?  where we 're just kind of creating new if not new speech at least new new FFT 's  that that have you know , which could be turned into speech  uh , that that have some of the noise removed .  Um , after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features .  And then those features are not now currently transformed by the neural net .

Bro025.B,"which I guess you you actually did linearly transform with the KLT ,  but but but uh , to orthogonalize them  but but they were not , uh , processed through a neural net .  And Stephane 's idea with that , as I recall , was that you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't ,  uh , which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when , uh , the testing set was quite different than what you 'd trained your discriminant features for .  So , um , all of that is is , uh still seems like a good idea .  The thing is now we know some other constraints .  We can't have unlimited amounts of latency .  Uh , y you know , that 's still being debated by the by people in Europe  but , uh , no matter how they end up there , it 's not going to be unlimited amounts ,  so we have to be a little conscious of that .  Um .  So there 's the neural net issue .  There 's the VAD issue .  And , uh , there 's the second stream thing .  And I think those that we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , uh , focused on .  Well , better ones are good .  I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ?  Is that what the deal is ?  With the rank ordering ?  I 'm sorry .  Oh , this is for the VAD .  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  Um .  So Yeah , I was just noticing on this that it makes reference to delay .  So what 's the ? If you ignore  Um , the VAD is sort of in in parallel ,  isn't i isn't it ,  with with the ? I mean , it isn't additive with the the , uh , LDA and the Wiener filtering , and so forth .  Right ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  And there  And there didn't seem to be any , uh , penalty for that ?  There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal ?  OK .  Well , may as well , then .  And he says Wiener filter is is forty milliseconds delay .  So is it ?  The smoothing ?  Right .  OK .  So that 's that 's really not not bad .  So we may in fact we 'll see what they decide . We may in fact have , um , the the , uh , latency time available for to have a neural net .

Bro025.B,"You know , they 're saying , uh one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds .  Two hundred and fifty is what it was before actually .  So ,  uh , some people are lobbying lobbying to make it shorter .  Um .  And , um .  Well , it just it when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it , is all .  I mean , how much effort do we put into making it causal ?  I mean , I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future .  But , um , it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past .  And we ha you know , limited machine and human time , and effort .  And , you know , how how much time should we put into into that ?  So it 'd be helpful if we find out from the the standards folks whether , you know , they 're gonna restrict that or not .  Um .

It might be hard if it 's at the server side .  Right ?  OK .  Well , you could .  Yeah . I mean , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , uh , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth .

Bro025.B,"That was I I had written that down there .  Um  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Hmm . Yeah . Well , it 's not surprising it 'd be worse the first time .  But , um ,  it does seem like , you know , i i i i some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and a a always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea .  Uh , maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first - teen fifteen frames more heavily than than was done in your first attempt .  But  but  Yeah .  Um .  No , I mean  Um ,  do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing ?  Yeah .  So that 's something you could do with , um , this final system .  Right ?  Just do this everything that is in this final system except , uh , use the channel zero .  Yeah .  And then see how much better it gets .  If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth  any more .  I see .  Not using these methods anyway . Yeah .  Well , yeah . And and also there 's just the fact that , um ,  eh , uh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , um , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general .  And , um , relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is is pretty  I mean , you might , you might not .  So , um .  Um , it 'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates .  Um .  But , um .  Well , I don't know .  What what do you , uh what do you guys see as as being what you would be doing in the next week , given wha what 's happened ?  OK .  This is a different net .  You see , the idea is that the , um , initial decision to that that you 're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly .  And that  Yeah . And that 's sort of fed forward , and and you say "" well , flush everything , it 's not speech anymore "" .  Um , it is used , uh  Yeah , it 's only used f Well , it 's used for frame - dropping .  Um , it 's used for end of utterance  because , you know , there 's if you have more than five hundred milliseconds of of of nonspeech then you figure it 's end of utterance or something like that .

Bro025.B,"I mean , keeping the same method  but but , uh , seeing if you cou but , um noise estimation could be improved .  Those are sort of related issues .

Bro025.C,"Uh . Yeah , we formed a coalition actually .  We already made it into one .  Yeah .  Hynek was here .  Mm - hmm .  Well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options ,  like you can parse command - line arguments .  So depending on that , it it becomes either spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering .  So , ye  Yeah . Yeah .  There 's just one piece of software .  Right .  Parameters . Yeah .  Best system .  Yeah .  Yeah .  No .  Our way .  Like another ten frames .  The the the smoothing the m the the filtering of the probabilities .  on the R .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  The LDA ?  Yeah . So so what happened right now , we removed the delay of the LDA .  So we I mean , if so if we if so which is like if we reduce the delay of VA  So , the f the final delay 's now ba is f determined by the delay of the VAD ,  because the LDA doesn't have any delay .  So if we re if we reduce the delay of the VAD , I mean , it 's like effectively reducing the delay .  So the LDA and the VAD both had a hundred millisecond delay .  So and they were in parallel ,  so which means you pick either one of them  the the biggest , whatever .  So , right now the LDA delays are more .  Pardon ?  Oh , no . It actually made it , like , point one percent better or something , actually .  Or something like that  and  Yeah . So that 's the one which Stephane was discussing , like  Yeah . The you smooth it and then delay the decision by  So .  Mm - hmm .  So , the one one one difference is that was there is like we tried computing the delta and then doing the frame - dropping .  The earlier system was do the frame - dropping and then compute the delta on the  So this  Yeah .  Yeah .  So we have no delta . And then  So the frame - dropping is the last thing that we do .  So , yeah , what we do is we compute the silence probability ,  convert it to that binary flag ,  and then in the end you c up upsample it to match the final features number of  It seems to be helping on the well - matched condition .  So that 's why this improvement I got from the last result .  So . And it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch ,  so in the final weightage it 's b b better  because the well - matched is still weighted more than  Uh , y you had something on it .

Bro025.C,"It 's , like , you mean you just transferred everything  and then finally drop the frames after the neural net .  Right ?  Yeah . That 's that 's one thing which  Yeah . Right now we are  Uh , ri  Right now what wha what we did is , like , we just mark we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , saying it 's currently a it 's a speech or a nonspeech .  So there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed .  And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them .  So . Yeah , that 's what that 's what that 's what , uh , this is doing right now .  Just one more thing .  Like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation ,  because we still ?  Yeah .  Is there was there any experiment with ?  Well , I I did The only experiment where I tried was I used the channel zero VAD for the noise estimation  and frame - dropping .  So I don't have a I don't have a split , like which one helped more .  So . It it was the best result I could get .  So , that 's the  Mm - hmm .  For the noise estimation .  Yeah . We can try something .  Mm - hmm . Sure .  Yeah . But the Guenter 's argument is slightly different .  It 's , like , ev even even if I use a channel zero VAD , I 'm just averaging the the s power spectrum .  But the Guenter 's argument is , like , if it is a non - stationary segment , then he doesn't update the noise spectrum .  So he 's , like he tries to capture only the stationary part in it .  So the averaging is , like , different from updating the noise spectrum only during stationary segments .  So , th the Guenter was arguing that , I mean , even if you have a very good VAD , averaging it , like , over the whole thing is not a good idea .  Because you 're averaging the stationary and the non - stationary , and finally you end up getting something  which is not really the s because , you anyway , you can't remove the stationary part fr I mean , non - stationary part from the signal .  So  Yeah . So you just update only doing or update only the stationary components .  Yeah . So , that 's so that 's still a slight difference from what Guenter is trying  Yeah , yeah .  Mmm .

Bro025.C,"Yeah .  So that that VAD was trained on the noisy features .  So , right now we have , like , uh we have the cleaned - up features ,  so we can have a better VAD by training the net on the cleaned - up speech .  Yeah , but we need a VAD for uh noise estimation also .  So it 's , like , where do we want to put the VAD ?  Uh , it 's like  For  Mm - hmm .  Uh , it actually comes at v at the very end .  So the net the final net I mean , which is the feature net  so that actually comes after a chain of , like , LDA plus everything .

Bro025.E,"Yeah . So .  Yeah . Almost .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  So it 's well , it 's spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering ,  um ,  depending on if we put if we square the transfer function or not .  And then with over - estimation of the noise , depending on the , uh the SNR , with smoothing along time ,  um ,  smoothing along frequency .  It 's very simple , smoothing things .  And , um , the best result is when we apply this procedure on FFT bins , uh , with a Wiener filter .  And there is no noise addition after after that .

Bro025.E,"because , um , with this way of dropping the frames they improve over the baseline by fourteen percent  and Sunil already showed that with our current VAD we can improve by more than twenty percent .

And another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for let 's say , for SpeechDat - Car .  We have channel zero which is clean ,  channel one which is far - field microphone .  And  if we just take only the , um , VAD probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far - field , uh , test utterances , then results are much better .

And it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function ,  the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion .  And after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins .  Mmm .  And , uh  Yeah ,  yeah .  It was  Yeah .  Uh , it 's on the transfer function .  So  Yeah .  Yeah , so basically we tried different configuration within this idea .  We tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering .  Um .  Well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well .

Then the LDA filter ,  mmm , then the downsampling ,  DCT ,  then , um , on - line normalization ,  followed by upsampling .  Then finally , we compute delta and we put the neural network also .

They 're working on a different task .  But what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , Pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast .  Uh .

So keep a certain set of things constant .  So , um .  Uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now ,  or ?  This this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ?  Oh , it 's on the transfer function for the Wiener filter .  Yeah , OK .  Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject .  This module , in principle , i I mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it .  I mean , because you you re - synthesize speech ,  right ?  So , um .  Uh , well you don't I guess you don't re - synthesize speech , but you could  Uh , but you could .  But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here .  Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well .  But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise .  And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well .  So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . And , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part .  So it 's  Anyway .  No , no . He 's I mean , e  Yeah , prelims , right .  Yeah .  So .  Uh , but but , you know , that 'll  uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation  because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable .

Bro026.B,"And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects .  And that 's hard enough .  I mean , I don't think we really  I mean , we 're trying to deal with that .  In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task .  And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects .  And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise .  Uh , even that 's hard enough .  And and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category .  i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around .  But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse ,  because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects .  And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects  but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard .  So we have to start  Since any almost any real situation is gonna have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things ,  we we actually have to think about both at the same time .  So ,  um So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out  and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have .  So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the FFT level .  Then  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  The the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ?  Yeah ,  OK .  And then the mel and then the log , and then the  LDA filter .  And then uh  downsample ,  DCT ,  on - line norm ,  Right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . And then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization .  Uh  Um .  Mm - hmm .  So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff .  Yeah .

Bro026.B,"I think there 's sort of like There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff .  There 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise .  And there 's gonna be a host of those .  But structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better VAD , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front .

Bro026.B,"Oh , are we ?  Is it ?  Yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close .  And and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things .  Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth  but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things .  But what what  Um , why are we using half ?  Well , so you could you c  Yeah , so I I think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I I think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects .  Uh , they have some cepstral modification ,  right ?  In our case we have a couple things .  We have the on - line normalization and then we have the LDA RASTA .  And they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us .  But in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing .  But there 's one difference .  The LDA RASTA , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies .  And they 're not doing that .  So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample .  So  Yeah .  I think it doesn't affect it ,  does it ?  Yeah .  So I think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information .  And , uh , so I you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot .  So that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple .  Um .  And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , "" oh , yeah , I understand "" , is is very helpful .  Well , that 's a question .  I mean , we were talking about that .  It looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise ,  um , and , uh ,  Yeah .  So , I mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion .  There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not .

Bro026.B,"Well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ?  Yeah , probably .  Some kind would be good .  You know ?  I would think .  If you do or don't normalize ?  Right .  Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize .  But I I w w  My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it .  And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , "" OK , this much effect "" I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens .  You want to change them one at a time .  So adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way .  And then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization .  Normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot .  So , I would think you would wanna have some baseline that says , "" OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get "" , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization .  But but the other question is  So I think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization .  I agree .  No , it 's in parallel .  We 're not talking about computation time here .  We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out .  So it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on .  It 's depending on the same data as the other .  So it 's in parallel .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Well , there 's the delays and the storage ,  yeah .  But I don't think the storage is so big for that .  I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net .  Right ?  Yeah .  Um .  And so I guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based TRAPS ,  and and how big are they ?  So that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue .  Maybe they can be little ones .  Mini - TRAPS .  Right .  And maybe for VAD they would be OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's true .  Or a simple neural net ,  right ?  I mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data .  And so ,  uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal .  It certainly doesn't take much space .  ","No , it 's in parallel .

Bro026.B,"So , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ?  Do you need to have an added layer or something ?  In which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big .  So .  So , uh ,  uh So what 's next ?  Maybe s s remind us .  What to freeze and then what to do after we froze .  Yeah .  And like I was saying , I think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh I mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . And then , uh , improving the VAD .  Uh .  So .  Right .  Right .  Um .  Have you ever ?  Very good question .  Have you ever worked with the Mississippi State h uh , software ?  Oh .

Bro026.B,"And , um , if they haven't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gonna be for this , uh , when "" deciding "" is not just somebody deciding . I mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . It it it seems pretty tight to me .  That 's when the evaluation is .

Great .  Yeah , I think that 'll be helpful .  There 's there 's not anybody OGI currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this  and and  I I think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do .  I mean , I think that it it is Uh .  Yeah .  Well , I mean , it 's it 's Conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if I 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check .  That you haven't come across you haven't invented features which are actually gonna do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary .  And , um , but it 's not the main emphasis .  I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary .  So it 's it 's a double check .  So they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight .  Yeah .  But , I mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with .  Uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal ,  right ?  It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that .  So you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect .  And , um , it wouldn't surprise me if they did something like that with this .  ",,
Bro026.B,"So again , if you 're if you get If it doesn't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much .  But if it if you don't if it doesn't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then  That 's it .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So we have the data , just not the recognizer .  OK .  Uh , well there 's training and test ,  right ?  No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it .

Anybody have anything else ?  Oh , well that 's pretty soon .  You know , their their They have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing .

Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ?  I mean , it 's to you .  I ju you guys are  Well , y anyway , you don't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . I 'll  support it either way , so .  OK .  Uh .  Got anything to tell us ?  Mm - hmm .  Are you looking at these in narrow bands ?  Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using ,  right ?  Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this .  I mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation ,  I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands .  That that seems to be kind of fundamental to it .  Um , and then the other thing , uh , is that I wonder about with it , and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything ,  but , I mean . Um , just wondering really .  Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better .  Um , and I don't know if that I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about .  Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , "" buh "" and "" puh "" differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration .  I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics .  ","And then if Joe feels like he needs a confirmation , Hari can answer it .  Got anything to tell us ?

Bro026.B,"So , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together .  And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , screwing up on this distinction .  So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work .  And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like .  And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing  if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , "" how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? ""  Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this ,  right ?  So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do .  So , what are we bringing to the party ?  I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together .  So that 's th that 's the hard thing .  I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation .  And it 's something that you really think you can pick up .  But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions .  So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ?  I mean , they 're the same sort of thing .  They 're both orthogonalizing .  But , you know  and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves .  Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think  on yourself .  Uh .  So , uh  Um ,  anyway . That 's my thought .  You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually .  ","So , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together .

Bro026.B,"I mean , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot .  And you 've been thinking about it more now ,  these categories .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them .  Right ?  Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly .  So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning ,  right ?  And  Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes .  You know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our  correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words .  I mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties ,  but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further .  You wanna go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing .  But ,  words aren't bad , yeah .  And and  Yeah .  But but but we 're not trying for models of words here .  See , so her here 's maybe where  If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough  I mean , what you wanna do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition .  And and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories  I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments  ",,
Bro026.B,"because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate .  In some way I mean , we derive that all the time .  In some ways it 's really not a bad bad thing to do  because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal .  Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way ,  where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit ,  uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever ,  but you sort of don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through .  You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it .  But I mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is , um i  Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true .  If you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , for the most part .  So so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level .  Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier  and and and , uh , the phones are  uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of  and , um And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon  Yeah ,  I mean , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit  I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive ,  but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise .  You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ?  Or is it cor you know , is it ?  I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones .  I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes don't get heard .  ",,
Bro026.B,"And if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen .  But , um , I don't know , I w I would I would guess that you 'd  W I don't know .  Anyway , that 's  Mm - hmm .  Well that  Oh , sure , that 's really big .  Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are .  So , I mean , that 's i  Right . We can't we can't get it at all without any language models .  Language models are there and important  but but , uh  Uh .  If we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it ,  but especially if it looks like the potential is there .  So  Should we do some digits ?  Since we 're here ?

So she has , um she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from from TIMIT ,  right ?  the most common phonemes .  And each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window .  And it has has these patterns .  Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands .  And , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .  And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how how closely related they are .  And you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related .  And  y yeah , yeah ,  a dendrogram tree .  Um .  Right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much .  And so , uh so you stop at that point .  And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops .

Um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those .

No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories .  And I think this the important categories are the words , and not the phones .  Maybe .  And so  Right .  If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters Uh  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Mmm .  So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that ,  but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans  because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know ,  and and it doesn't really hurt ,  and  I 'm not sure how how to build that in .  Uh .  I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level .  You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation .  And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there .

That 'd be something to look at sometime  because what , um , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room .  Would that be more like  Well , you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car ,  I guess ,  in terms of the noise .  The SpeechDat - Car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it .

So , uh  Yep .  I mean , that that was sort of one  I mean ,  the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set .  Uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot .  And But if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set  I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora ,  we have all those parameters just set as they are .  So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything .  So ,  um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data .  Uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data .  It does it automatically , actually .  And so ,  um ,  uh ,  that one really benefited from the larger set .  And it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth .  Uh , so , um ,  that , uh that seemed to be  So , if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters , and if you , um , have the natural room , which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio , then in that case , um , the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation . And and not bother with with this acoustic , uh , processing .  But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , uh , the convolutional kind of things we were doing .  So .  That 's sort of what we found .

So , our ,  um  Yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on SpeechDat - Car  ","If it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , uh , meet it by moving the delta back .  I mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it .  I mean , if if if a week before we have to be done someone says , "" Well , you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now "" , it would be pretty frantic around here .  and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit ,  I mean , we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape .  Well , it 's I think it 's better than anything , uh , anybody got .  ","The group discussed possible further investigations that arose from these areas, including better linking the two. "
Bro027.B,"which is a hard task ,  cuz it 's really , um I think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be .  I mean , it 's still terri  Yeah .  Yeah .  Probably half .  Good !  Yeah .  So you you were get  Probably . Yeah .  So fi si fifty - three is what you were getting with the old VAD .  And , uh  and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating VAD .  And fifty - seven is what you got with the real VAD .  That 's great .  OK .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  No .  Yeah ,  h he likes to use them both ,  cuz then it has one part that 's discriminative ,  one part that 's not .  y  You 're just using the full ninety features ?  Y you have ninety features ?  And from the other side it 's forty - five .  So it 's you have seventy - three features ,  and you 're just feeding them like that .  There isn't any KLT or anything ?  It 's a multiple of seven .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , yeah .  But , I mean , just in general , adding information  Suppose the information you added , well , was a really terrible feature and all it brought in was noise .  Right ?  So so , um  Or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible ,  but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had ,  except it was noisier .  Right ?  In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all .  Uh - huh .  On the highly mismatched condition .  So , "" highly mismatched condition "" means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test .  So having having , uh , a g a l a greater number of features , if they aren't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , uh , make things worse .  I mean , you 're right .  If you have if you have , uh , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help .  But but it 's It doesn't necessarily work that way .  So I wonder ,  um ,  Well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , we might uh , we might have to experiment with , uh better training sets .  Again .  But ,  I The other thing is , I mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different The rest of it is different ,  ","You 're just using the full ninety features ?

"
Bro027.B,"right ?  So ,  um ,  uh ,  For instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ?  I mean , you know what the straight features do .  That gives you this .  You know what it does in combination .  You don't necessarily know what  But , yeah , that 's obviously another thing to try ,  since things are things are different .  And I guess if the  These are all  so all of these seventy - three features are going into , um , the , uh the HMM .  And is are i i are are any deltas being computed of tha of them ?  n Not of the  Are not .  Could .  i  Yeah ,  but the other thing I was thinking was ,  um  Uh , now I lost track of what I was thinking .  But .  Oh ,  I know what I was gonna say .  No relation .  The issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gonna be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere  which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth .  And so ,  uh ,  they felt they wanted to set a limit .  So they chose sixty .  Some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters  and and that bothered some other people .  u And so  they just chose that .  I I I think it 's kind of r arbitrary too .  But but that 's that 's kind of what was chosen .  I I remembered what I was going to say .  What I was going to say is that , um , maybe maybe with the noise removal , uh , these things are now more correlated .  So you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated , uh , within themselves ,  but they 're pretty correlated with one another .  And , um ,  they 're being fed into these , uh , variants , only Gaussians and so forth ,  and and , uh ,  so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one KLT over everything ,  to de - correlate it .  Maybe .  You know .  Yeah .  So we found this this , uh this Macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good .  So that 's i after you explore these other alternatives , that might be another way to start looking , is is just improving the training set .  I mean , we were getting , uh , lots better recognition using that , than  ","For instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ?

Bro027.B,"Of course , you do have the problem that , um , u i we are not able to increase the number of Gaussians , uh , or anything to , uh , uh , to match anything .  So we 're only improving the training of our feature set ,  but that 's still probably something .  Yeah ,  that 's the only place that we can train .  We can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount ,  so .  Um ,  um  Yeah .  How big is the net , by the way ?  And again , you did experiments back then where you made it bigger  and it and that was that was sort of the threshold point .  Much less than that , it was worse ,  and  much more than that , it wasn't much better .  Hmm .  Oh ,  so Right .  So the training the the neural net is being trained with noise compensated stuff .  Which makes sense ,  but , uh , you 're saying Yeah , the noisier ones are still going to be , even after our noise compensation , are still gonna be pretty noisy .  Right .  Yes .  Right .  Right .  Right ,  but the SpeechDat - Car data that you 're seeing is also reduced in noise  by the noise compensation .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , I mean , it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set .  Uh  Right ?  I mean , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before ,  but if they were both the same before , then if they were both reduic reduced equally , then , there would not be a mismatch .  So ,  I mean , this may be  Heaven forbid , this noise compensation process may be imperfect ,  but .  Uh ,  so maybe it 's treating some things differently .  I mean , one of the things about  I mean , the Macrophone data , um , I think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones .  And , um ,  so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions .  I mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything .  So it 's not the same .  I don't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car ,  but I think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it doesn't , uh , make it better , the most uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set .  Um  I mean , what we were  uh the condition It it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with Meeting Recorder digits ,  ",,
Bro027.B,"even though there , again , these m Macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here .  I mean , we weren't talking over a telephone here .  But it was just I think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing .  Number of deletions .  Yeah .  Me either .  Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better ?  Say , for the I mean , it  So it 's only the highly mismatched ?  And it Remind me again ,  the "" highly mismatched "" means that the  Uh , sorry ?  Close mike training  Right .  So  Well , maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech .  Wh  Yeah , right .  Uh , that 's right , that 's right .  Um  But , yeah ,  actually the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises  and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ?  It 's it 's pretty different .  Isn't it ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I I think that if you run it  Actually , you maybe you remember this .  When you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ?  Was it about the same ?  Uh , w i  Than ?  So ,  until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all .  Well , that 's interesting .  Yeah .  Yeah .  They were doing similar enough things .  Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing .  And and the thing I I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse .  Maybe that they 're a lot worse .  You know ?  And , um  But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow .  If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on on , uh , improving the the net .  Um .  So what 's the overall effe  I mean , you haven't done all the experiments  ","Me either .  Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better ?  So it 's only the highly mismatched ?

If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on on , uh , improving the the net .  ",
Bro027.B,"but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ?  But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower ,  so I wonder what the net effect is .  Right .  Right .  So the so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four ,  and and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better  Uh .  Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out .  Yeah .  The a the argument i is kind of i in  and it 's not like we really know ,  but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob  I mean , discriminative things are good .  LDA , neural nets , they 're good .  Uh , they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between .  And PCA doesn't do that .  It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically .  But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different .  So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space  but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else .  And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not .  So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make ,  and then , uh , you you discriminately train it ,  but you also take the path that that doesn't have that ,  and putting those in together .  And that that seem  So it 's kind of like a combination of the uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something .  It 's it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination  but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things .  And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he he when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case .  There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training .  But by having them both there  The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you .  ",,
Bro027.B,"And some of the time it 's going to hurt you ,  and by combining two information sources if , you know if if  That i i  I think that 's counter to that idea .  Now , again , it 's we 're just trying these different things .  We don't really know what 's gonna work best .  But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that .  Um ,  and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA .  Though , maybe not .  Right .  Well , I think that 's a good idea .  Did did you do that  or tha that 's a  Yeah .  Yeah .  No , well , that 's a good idea .  I I  i Yeah .  Oh , no  it 's a g  No , no ,  but it might not not even be true .  I mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea .  I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them .  And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters ,  and You know , I mean , uh ,  so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it .  Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years ,  but but but , uh ,  And now they all have that .  I see .  Yeah .  I mean , part of why  I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ?  So you were just trying  I think you r  I mean , this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect  but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ?  I think you were .  Does something .  It doesn't work as well .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But  i d I 'm sorry ,  does it still have the median filter stuff ?  So it still has most of the delay ,  it just doesn't  Well , w i  ",,

What about using it in the neural net ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , uh , good thing .

Well , what I think , you know , would be more what you 'd want to do is is is , uh , put it into another neural net .  Right ?  And then  But ,  yeah , we 're we 're not quite there yet .  So we have to figure out the neural nets , I guess .  Wh - uh , the the VAD what ?  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  You could feed it into the neural net .  The other thing you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , based on the fact that you have a silence probability .  Right ?  So you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is ,  and you could multiply the two things , and renormalize .

Bro027.B,"to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between .  Well , yeah .  But this other thing isn't perfect .  So that you bring in some information from the net itself .  Yeah .  Now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that I I I The the fact  i i It 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions .  Is too high .  Yeah .  So maybe  So  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , for instance .  But I bu  Yeah .  Now the only problem is you don't want to ta I guess wait for the output of the VAD before you can put something into the other system ,  cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot ,  right ?  Am I missing something here ?  Yeah .  So that 's maybe a problem with what I was just saying .  But  but I I guess  No .  Yeah .  It 's kind of done in  I mean , some of the things are , not in parallel ,  but certainly , it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net .  In time .  So maybe , if that doesn't work ,  um  But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem , anyway .  And and and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD , and feeding it into the other one as well .  And then maybe it would just learn learn it better .  Um  But that 's  Yeah , that 's an interesting thing to try to see , if what 's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition , it 's , um , causing deletions by having this silence probability up up too high ,  at some point where the VAD is saying it 's actually speech .  Which is probably true .  Cuz  Well , the V A  if the VAD said  since the VAD is is is right a lot ,  uh  Hmm .  Anyway .  Might be .  Yeah .  Well , we just started working with it .
