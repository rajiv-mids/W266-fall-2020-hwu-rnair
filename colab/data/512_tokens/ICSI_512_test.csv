Bed004.A,"Hey , you 're not supposed to be drinking in here dude .  Do we have to read them that slowly ?  OK .  Sounded like a robot .  Um , this is t  When you read the numbers it kind of reminded me of beat poetry .  Three three six zero zero .  Four two zero zero  one seven .  That 's what I think of when I think of beat poetry .  You ever seen "" So I married an axe murderer "" ?  There 's a part wh there 's parts when he 's doing beat poetry .  And he talks like that .  That 's why I thi  That uh probably is why I think of it that way .  Mike Meyers is the guy .  It - it 's his uh it 's his cute romantic comedy .  That 's that 's  That 's his cute romantic comedy , yeah .  The other thing that 's real funny , I 'll spoil it for you .  is when he 's he works in a coffee shop ,  in San Francisco ,  and uh he 's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso ,  and he 's like "" excuse me I ordered the large espresso ? ""  Wait  do are y  So you 're trying to decide who 's the best taster of tiramisu ?  Ah .  Hmm .  Seems like  Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours .  Then , if you were to bribe them , you could uh  Well , I 'm going back to visit my parents this weekend ,  so , I 'll be out of town .  No , the South Bay ,  yeah .  We are .  Is Nancy s uh gonna show up ?  Mmm .  Wonder if these things ever emit a very , like , piercing screech right in your ear ?  Is she mispronouncing "" Anlage "" ?  Is it "" Anlaga "" or "" Anlunga ""  OK .  Yes .  I wasn't wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for uh "" not a man "" .  Are you sure ?  Yeah , that 's so @ @ .  So , what I did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net  because I was I I took I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out  so what I did was I took  I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .  And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .  And I separated them out .  And then I um did similar things for our our net to uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot ,  ","So , what I did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net  ","It is not a working net yet, but identifying clusters of features that define the output mode provides a visual aid for further work. "
Bed004.A,"um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer .  And then the bottom layer is just the Mode .  So .  Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says "" Mode "" which is the decision between the  So basically all I did was I took the last belief - net  and I grouped things according to what how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related .  And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones .  And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably .  Um , you know , we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,  or they were hurried .  That 's kind of related to that .  And then um in terms of the source , the things uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether  Oh actually , I kind of , I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one  but uh whether the where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether  or the "" landmark - iness "" of where I 'm currently at .  And "" usefulness "" is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not something that you 'd visit for tourist 's tourism 's sake or whatever .  "" Travel constraints "" would be something like you know , maybe they said they can they only wanna take a bus or something like that ,  right ?  And then those are somewhat related to the path ,  so that would determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly .  Um , "" Goal "" .  Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed  and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination .  Um , and then if you go up ,  Robert ,  Yeah , so um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person .  Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours  or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines .  Uh , Prosody I don't really I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context ,  so I just made up you know whether whether what they say is or h how they say it is is that .  ","So basically all I did was I took the last belief - net  and I grouped things according to what how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related .

"
Bed004.A,"Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose ,  and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said "" I need to get there quickly "" or whatever .  And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .  Tourbook ?  That would be , I don't know , the "" landmark - iness "" of things ,  whether it 's in the tourbook or not .  Well , this is not a working Bayes - net .  Well I OK , I just  Say what you were gonna say .  OK .  Uh I I 'd No , I was gonna wait until  So we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the Mode .  Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise .  Well I oh yeah , I unders I understand that ,  I just uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that .  OK .  Mmm .  So it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that  OK .  So in that case , the sum we 'd have we  I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes .  We 'd have the summary nodes like  where the things were I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other  Yeah .  Mmm .  Mmm .  OK .  So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?  So that  Mmm .  Yeah .  We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract .  Right .  This is uh  so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the for the X - schema ?  OK .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  So the immediate problem is just deciding w which  Yeah .  Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?  OK .  OK .  There 's just too many factors right now .  Right .  So what we really wanna do i  cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it expand it out into more layers basically ?  Right .  So instead of in instead it should really be just be "" intention "" as a node instead of "" intention business "" or "" intention tour "" .  Right .  Right .  I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention  and  the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time  Mmm .  OK .  ","Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose ,  And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .

Bed004.A,"Well , see I don't think those would be mutually  it seems like something could both be  OK .  ",,
Bed004.B,"Mm - hmm .  So , are are you trying to record this meeting ?  S so if you just number them "" one "" , "" two "" , "" three "" it 's  OK .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  True .  Mm - hmm .  Great .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  Right .  Uh .  OK ,  great .  So first of all , I agree that um we should hire Fey , and start paying her .  Probably pay for the time she 's put in as well .  Um , do you know exactly how to do that ,  or is uh Lila  I mean , you know what exactly do we do to to put her on the payroll in some way ?  OK .  Well , you 'll have to .  Right .  So anyway ,  um  So why don't you uh ask Lila  and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in  th  Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a a student ,  she just graduated  but anyway .  So i if  Yeah , I agree ,  she sounded fine ,  she a actually was uh , more uh , present and stuff than than she was in conversation ,  so she did a better job than I would have guessed from just talking to her .  So I think that 's great .  Yeah .  Right .  Oh , yeah ,  and then of course as she does it she 'll she 'll learn @ @ .  So that 's great .  Um And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .  And , uh she 's actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm ,  so I think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gonna need to know uh , to do her career .  So , I my guess is she 'll be r r quite happy to take on that job .  And , so  Great .  Well , as I say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to  uh  Yeah .  We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something ,  but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff .  And and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .  Uh , so that 's good .  Um . Now , I signed us up for the Wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this .  So ,  my idea on that was uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists ,  ","S so if you just number them "" one "" , "" two "" , "" three "" it 's  Um And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .

"
Bed004.B,"but partly I did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically ,  because to the extent that we can get them contributing ,  that will be good .  So this issue about you know re - formulating things ,  maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it ,  uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist ,  but in any case ,  um , the linguistics students and stuff .  So my idea on on Wednesday is partly to uh  you I mean , what you did today would i is just fine .  You just uh do "" this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and so forth . ""  But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of of what 's going on with the system design ,  and where we think the belief - nets fit in  and where the pieces are and stuff like that .  Is is this make sense to everybody ?  Yeah .  So , I don't I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to to to make a big presentation .  I don't think you should  you don't have to make any new uh PowerPoint or anything .  I think we got plenty of stuff to talk about .  And , then um just see how a discussion goes .  Great .  Yep .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  So , let 's let 's  Yeah , I don't understand it .  Let 's go  Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p very bottom looks like ,  or is that it ?  OK , great .  Alright .  So  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  Right ,  yep .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right , OK .  Mm - hmm .  Ch - ch - ch - ch .  Now .  Alright , so I understand what 's what you got .  I don't yet understand how you would use it .  So let me see if I can ask  a s  Right .  No , I understand that ,  but but um  So , what  Let 's slide back up again  and see  start at the at the bottom  and  Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop .  Yeah .

Bed004.B,"So , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh Bayes - net ,  that is , you know , with fill  you know , actually f uh , fill it @ @ in , then uh  Well , I don't  That 's an issue .  So , um  Well , here 's the problem .  And and uh Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today  is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the Mode thing .  And uh  Well , i But that 's what we have to do .  OK , so , so ,  uh .  There there are a variety of ways of doing it .  Uh . Let me just mention something that I don't want to pursue today  which is there are technical ways of doing it ,  uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes  and  there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness .  Uh , so . If you co you could ima and I  now I don't know that any of those actually apply in this case ,  but there is some technology you could try to apply .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And , um  So .  Yeah .  So what I was gonna say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally  I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are .  So , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode ,  you know , what are the most relevant things .  And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics .  So that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be ,  OK ?  then you could say "" Aha , let 's have these three factors "" ,  OK ?  and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one .  And then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about .  So that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing  given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that .  Um  ","is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the Mode thing .  which is there are technical ways of doing it ,  uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes  I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are .  you know , what are the most relevant things .

And then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about .  ",There are potential problems from a combinatorics perspective. These can be tackled either with technical adjustments or through careful knowledge engineering. 
Bed004.B,"and  "" Eh - eh - eh . ""  Yeah .  Well , mmm , something .  I mean , so uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around ,  so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things .  and , um , I understand where this the uh  this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way .  Uh , I don't think our friends uh on Wednesday are going to be able to  Well , maybe they will .  Well , let me think about whether whether I think we can present this to them or not .  Um ,  Uh ,  Alright , well , le let me think about this some more ,  and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Good .  OK , I 'm sorry .  You 're you 're  It was much too quick for me .  OK , so let me see if I understand what you 're saying .  So , I I do understand that uh you can take the M - three - L and add not and it w  and you need to do this , for sure ,  we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff ,  and what I think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say "" If it 's of type "" Landmark "" , then you take you 're gonna take a picture of it . ""  F full stop ,  I mean , that 's what you do .  Ev - every landmark you take a picture of ,  you enter  You approach .  OK .  Uh , and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing SmartKom system .  And you just did ,  right ?  OK .  Ah .  Well . So , s well , and let 's think about this .  Um , that 's a that 's another kind of baseline case ,  that 's another sort of thing "" OK , here 's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this "" .  Add extra properties ,  a deterministic rule for every property  you have an action , "" pppt ! ""  You do that .  Um , then the question would be  Uh Now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology ,  OK ?  because that 's all you 're all you 're using is this type the types in the ontology and you 're done .  Right ?  ","Alright , well , le let me think about this some more ,  and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them .

Add extra properties ,  a deterministic rule for every property  ",A base solution for the task would be to simply add some extra action-mode rules in the SmartKom system. 
Bed004.B,"So we don't we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things .  Alright , but that 's but that 's OK , and I mean it it 's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things .  And that 's something the uh SmartKom people themselves would  they 'd say "" Sure , that 's no problem  you know , no problem to add types to the ont ""  Right ?  Hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh , "" approach "" , you called it , I think this time .  That 's what you said  Yeah , that 's fine .  Yeah , but  Right .  But it 's not construction there , it 's action .  Construction is a d is a different story .  For for for  Yes .  Yeah .  So that that uh  i if you had the generalized "" Go "" X - schema  and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters .  And then uh , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would go to the GIS  and use that to actually get you know , detailed route planning .  So , you know , where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that .  But that 's not It 's not the immediate problem .  But , presumably that that that functionality 's there when when we  Yeah , so the pro The immediate problem is is back t t to what you were what you are doing with the belief - net .  You know , uh what are we going to use to make this decision  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Well , that that actually is relatively easy in this case .  The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ?  And that the the that 's the hardest problem .  So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology .  The h  So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is is  where are you gonna  how are you gonna g get this information .  Um ,  and that 's so , getting back to here ,  uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we we don't want all the com  too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially .  So we wanna think about which ones we really care about  and what they really most depend on ,  and can we c you know , clean this this up to the point where it  Right .  We might .

",There are potential problems from a combinatorics perspective. 
Bed004.B,"Uh , I mean that that 's certainly one thing we can do .  Uh , it 's true that the way you have this , a lot of the times you have  what you 're having is the values rather than the variable .  So uh  OK ?  So you  Yeah ,  right ,  and then it would have values , uh , "" Tour "" , "" Business "" , or uh "" Hurried "" .  But then but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters .  I mean , it 's fine .  You know , we have to it 's it 's iterative .  We 're gonna have to work with it some .  Well , you you could do that .  And it 's perfectly OK to uh insist that that , you know , th um , they add up to one ,  but that there 's uh that that it doesn't have to be one zero zero .  OK .  So you could have the conditional p  So  the each of these things is gonna be a a a probability .  So whenever there 's a choice ,  uh  so like landmark - ness and usefulness ,  OK  Absolutely right .  And so that you might want to then have those  b Th - Then they may have to be separate .  They may not be able to be values of the same variable .  So that 's  but again , this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through .  Right .  It 's you know , it 's great is is , you know , as one step toward uh toward where we wanna go .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I think that 's I think that 's exactly right .  There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process .  Yeah ,  no I think that 's that 's just fine .  Uh , yeah .  So they 'll they presumably there 'll be a thread or process or something that  "" Agent "" , yeah , "" Agent "" , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah ,  that uh is rule - driven , and can can uh can do things like that .  And um there 's an issue about whether there will be that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision ,  so it probably will .  My guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through a a c this belief - net that  turn a crank in the belief - net ,  that 'll come out with s uh more another vector ,  OK ,  ","There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process .

Bed004.B,"which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end .  So you now know what you 're gonna do  and that may actually involve getting more information .  So on once you pull that out , it could be that that says "" Ah !  Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else . ""  OK ?  Now that we know that it 's a bus trip ,  OK ?  we didn't We didn't need to know beforehand , uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more .  So I think that 's OK .  OK .  Oh , OK .  Uh .  I confess , I 'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story .  Um .  I  i This this is not a complaint , this is a promise to do more work .  So I 'm gonna hafta think about it some more .  Um . In particular  see what we 'd like to do , and and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use .  So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source source , paths and goals , and nnn all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks .  And that uh there 's there 's some some important generalities that you 're getting ,  so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it .  And I don't yet see how that goes .  Alright .  u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this  So I y I 'm just just there saying eee well you I know how to do any individual case ,  right ?  but I don't yet  see what 's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to get powerful generalizations .  And  um  Could . Uh .  Yeah .  Well , I I don't like the term either , so I have n i  uh  i i y w i i  It uh  Could be .  I 'm not a I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task ,  I mean , eventually we 're gonna want a whole range of them .  Uh ,  I 'm just saying that I 'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this .  I just at the moment don't know .  H  No .  Well , no the Bayes the Bayes - nets  The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision .  ","which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end .  and that may actually involve getting more information .  So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source source , paths and goals , and nnn all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks .  And that uh there 's there 's some some important generalities that you 're getting ,  And I don't yet see how that goes .  ","For instance, the final combination of features used in the current study may form a representation of the ontology, general enough to employ in any task that includes trajectors and paths. "
Bed004.B,"But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the uh general .  So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that ,  and there 's a language for talking about trajectors ,  you shouldn't have to do that differently  for uh uh going to something , than for circling it ,  for uh telling someone else how to go there ,  whatever it is .  So that that , the the decision processes are gonna be different  What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs .  So all sorts of different tasks and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on .  And that 's that would be the really pretty result .  And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom ,  i that that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent  you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff ,  in independent of whether it about what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way .  So that 's the  You might .  You might .  You might be able to to uh  say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the  there 's Let 's say there 's a uh cont  there the the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container .

We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .

And um we already talked with Andreas , Thilo and David  and some lines of code were already written today  and almost tested  and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on  and that should be no problem  and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get enter the tourism domain .  em we have talked this morning with the with Tilman about the generator .  and um There one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English  because w we have we face two ways .  Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way ,  or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system  and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse  uh not parse not  the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure  which is the way we decided we were gonna go because A , it 's easier in the beginning  and um it does require some some knowledge of of those grammars and and and some ling linguistic background .  But um it shouldn't be a problem for anyone .  the the ultimate goal is that before they leave we we can run through the entire system input through output on at least one or two sample things .  And um and by virtue of doing that then in this case Johno will have acquired the knowledge of how to extend it .  Ad infinitum .  When needed , if needed , when wanted and so forth .  And um also um Ralf has hooked up with David and you 're gonna continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever to get the er parser interface working .  They are thinning out and thickening out lattices  and doing this kind of stuff to see what works best .  Should we already set a date for that ?  Might be beneficial while we 're all here .  Thursday morning sounds fine ?  Neither does Thursday morning ,  no ?  Uh he will be in Washington , though .  but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer .  OK so  facing to to what we 've sort of been doing here  um  ","and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on  and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get enter the tourism domain .

Bed009.B,"well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data .  um um Not this type of data ,  no not meeting data but sort of sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such  not like the ones in Munich but pretty close to it .  The major difference to the Munich ones is that we do it via the telephone  even though all the recording is done here  and so it 's a sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information  tells you how to get places .  And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on .  and part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human .  and we 're setting it up so that we can we hope to implant certain intentions in people .  For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that "" How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? ""  OK so you have the castle of Heidelberg  and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower .  and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ?  Probably something that we specified in M - three - L ,  that is @ @ "" action go to whatever domain , object whatever Powder - Tower "" .  And maybe some model will tell us , some GPS module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment .  And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project  and we noticed that first of all what are  I should 've brought some slides ,  but what our  So here 's the tower .  Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower .  And our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower .  There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center  Because that 's how the algorithm works .  So we took out that part of the road network as a hack  and then it found actually the way to the entrance .  which was now the closest point of the road network to  OK , geometric center .  But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter ,  because it 's not really interesting .  They wanna go to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture .  And so what uh uh a s you s  let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants .  Does he wanna go there to see it ?  ",well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data .  no not meeting data but sort of sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such  and so it 's a sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information  let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants .  ,
Bed009.B,"Does he wanna go there now ?  Later ?  How does the person wanna go there ?  Is that person more likely to want to walk there ?  Walk a scenic route ?  and so forth .  There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things .  And we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role .  Information related to the user and information related to the situation .  And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that  what we can get from the utterance .  That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently  whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it .  And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was .  And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance .  So if it can make a good suggestion , "" Hey ! ""  you know , "" that person doesn't wanna enter .  That person just wants to take a picture , "" cuz he just bought film ,  or "" that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before "" .  Or "" that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something  and that you usually do inside of buildings "" and so forth .  These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an sort of subfield that we have reserved .  And if the action planner does something with it , great .  If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really  at least we want to offer the extra information . We don't really um we 're not too worried .  I mean t s Ultimately if you have if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s do something with it sooner or later .  That 's sort of part of our belief .  Um , for example , right now I know the GIS from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints .  So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically ,  but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it .  Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used ,  so .  What have I forgotten about ?  Oh yeah ,  how we do it ,  yeah that 's the  ",And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was .

Bed009.B,"I don't know how many pages  and that 's just part of how do I get to one place .  It 's really insane .  and uh  but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh Michael into the discussion .  Or to enter his discussion , actually .  That 's the way around .  Markus  Is he new in the in the ?  Is he gonna continue with the old uh thing ?  OK .  Yes I was just that 's my next question  whether we 're we 're gonna stick to Prolog or not .  OK  But I do think the the function modeling concept has a certain makes sense in a in a certain light  because the action planner should not be or the dialogue manager in that case should not um w have to worry about whether it 's interfacing with um something that does route planning in this way or that way  huh ,  it j  and it cant sort of formulate its what it wants in a in a rather a abstract uh way ,  you know f "" Find me a good route for this .

So well , let me Let me s expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation .  So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig  um Robert didn't bring it today but there 's a a belief - net which is  There 's a first cut at a belief - net that that doesn't it isn't fully uh instantiated ,  and in particular some of the the combination rules and ways of getting the the conditional probabilities aren't there .  But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space  and the things that influence them .  So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing .  Do you want to um access , view or enter a thing .  So that 's a a discrete decision .  There are only three possibilities and the uh  what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner .  But , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want .  Alright ?  Now there are two ways one can go a imagine doing that .  For the debugging we 'll probably just have a a drop - down menu  and the while you 're debugging you will just  OK .  But for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query ,  give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know ar are you know you are you planning to enter ?  Or whatever it whatever that might be .  So that 's under that model  then , There would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query ,  presumably give it to you .  That would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer back .  And that would of course the answer would have to be parsed .  right  and  OK so , th that uh ,  ","So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing .  So that 's a a discrete decision .

Bed009.F,"We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .  But While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said "" OK we 're now ready to try to close that loop "" in terms of querying about some of these decisions .  Hmm .  D did you know this Robert ?  So we ha we have to get in on that .  because um partly those are like X - schemas .  the transition diagrams .  And it may be that that um we should early on make sure that they have the flexibility that we need .  So there 's ac so there th the word "" action "" , OK , is is what 's ambiguous here .  So , um one thing is there 's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now ,  per tells the person how to go ,  "" First go here ,  first go there  uh , you know , take a bus "" ,  whatever it is .  So that 's that form of planning , and action , and a route planner and GIS , all sort of stuff .  uh But I think that isn't what you mean .  Well , OK ,  so that 's what I thought .

Bed009.F,"Right .  OK .  Could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ?  Yeah , th there there I think there are a lot of reasons why it matters .  OK ,  so that  uh ,  for example , the i it 's the action planner is going to take some spec and s make some suggestions about what the user should do .  What the user says after that is going to be very much caught up with what the action planner told it .  If the If the parser and the language end doesn't know what the person 's been told  OK  th it 's you 're making your life much more difficult than it has to be .  Right ?  So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi ,  let 's say .  Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast ,  take a taxi .  OK .  And the language end doesn't know that .  OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine .  uh  Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse .  This is actually the state of the plan .  That 's why  OK so it z  and s  uh , It 's great if people are already taking that into account .  But One would have t have to see see the details .

So that forces the dialogue manager to change state .  OK .  It could be y  Yeah , yeah it it  OK .  Oh , yeah , yeah .  How 's it  S so uh y we we looked at the e current pattern matching thing .

Uh to the form of of uh conceptual grammar that that w we have in mind for this .  It won't talk particularly about how that relates to what uh Robert was saying at the beginning .  But let me give you a very short version of this .  So we talked about the fact that There 're going to be a certain number of decisions That you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning .  It 's called the "" route planner "" or something .  So there are these decisions .  And then one half of this we talked about at little bit is how if you had the right information ,  if you knew something about what was said  and about th the something about was the agent a tourist or a native or a business person  or uh young or old ,  whatever .

Bed009.F,"Uh , what we 're calling "" the entity "" ,  Is it a castle ,  is it a bank ?  Is it a s town square ,  is it a statue ?  Whatever .  So all that kind of information could be combined into decision networks and give you decisions .  But the other half of the problem is How would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ?  So , um  So what you might try to do is just build more templates , saying uh  we 're trying to build a templ  you know build a template that w uh somehow would capture the fact that he wants to take a picture .  OK ?  And and we could you could do this .  And it 's a small enough domain that probably you , you know  OK .  You could do this .  But uh from our point of view this is also a research project  and there are a couple of people not here for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations on this ,  and the idea that we 're really after is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics  and the notion that there are a relatively small number of primitive conceptual schemas that characterize a lot of activity .  So a typical one in this formulation is a container .  So this is a static thing .  And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers .  Going in and out the portals and con  OK .  But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical things are also characterized this way .  You get in trouble and you know et cetera  and so s  So , what we 're really trying to do is to map from the discourse to the conceptual semantics level .  And from there to the appropriate decisions .  So another one of these primitive , what are called "" image schemas "" , is uh goal seeking .  So this a notion of a source , path , goal , trajector , possibly obstacles .  And the idea is this is another conceptual primitive .  And that all sorts of things , particularly in the tourist domain , can be represented in terms of uh source , path and goal .  So the idea would be could we build an analyser that would take an utterance  and say "" Aha !  th this utterance is talking about an attempt to reach a goal .  The goal is this ,  the pers the , uh traveller is that ,  uh  the sor w where we are at now is is this ,  they 've mentioned possible obstacles , et cetera .

Bed009.F,"So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface .  And then ,  uh  The processing of that , both on the input end , recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera ,  and on the output end , given this kind of information , you can then uh make decisions about what actions to take .  Provides , they claim , a very powerful , general notion of deep semantics .  So that 's what we 're really doing .  And  Nancy is going to  Her talk is going to be not about using this in applications , but about modeling how children might learn this kind of uh deep semantic grammar .  Well that 's that 's that 's where the belief - net comes in .  So th the idea is ,  let 's take this business about going to the Powder - Tower .  So part of what you 'll get out of this will be the fact tha w  if it works right ,  OK , that this is an agent that wants to go to this place  and that 's their goal  and there will be additional situational information .  Uh , OK ,  part of it comes from the ontology .  The tower is this kind of object .  Part of it comes from the user model .  And the idea of the belief - net is it combines the information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way ,  you know this is a this is a goal seeking behavior , along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved  and about the situation about "" Is it raining ? ""  I don't know .  Whatever it is .  And so that 's the belief - net that we 've laid out .  And so th the coupling to the situation comes in this model from , at th at th at the belief - net , combining evidence from the dialogue with the ontology with the situation .

Bed016.E,"And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .

So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal  and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff you can do the same grammar .  And it is the same grammar .  But , um ,  the trick is that the  the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container .  Well , "" trouble "" isn't a container ,  but it gets constr construed as a c container .  Et cetera .  So that 's that 's where this , um ,  Right .  So 's it 's it it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework ,  and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't ,  um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could .

When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um some kind of a special speaker phone  and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise .  And then it was uh And then it would come on and it was very clear ,  you know .  Three Three hours .

Bmr005.A,"One is uh um without doing the digits Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits ,  what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff .  You do , OK .  I see , OK .  Have they ever responded to you ?  Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water ,  or is that still a possibility ?

So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type  and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on ,  and um , the question was raised "" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? ""  And and Dan Ellis said , "" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to "" .  Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ?  So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret "" ahead of the game "" ?  You know . So it 's the it 's i What you what you int what you draw you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,  that um , i that i we have enough space ,  and he continues , like "" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling "" .

Bmr005.B,"that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space ,  and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far .  But there are a lot of different things like that .  It 's possible .  Uh , he was he he you know We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically  and then uh meet again .  So it 's , you know , not a matter of a  But , yeah , I think I think it was optimistic .

Bmr005.B,"Then the issue of of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive .  So I think it 's really really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to  because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ?  Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it ,  you know .  I understand .  No I just I just was suggesting that it 's not a bad policy p potentially .  So , we need to talk about this later .  Uh - huh .  Yeah , depends on which one you mean .  Yeah .  Does this ?  So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ?  For  That would j just be one .  OK .  But a a a th  But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's  Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot .  Silent .  Oh .  Oh , I see .  Well  Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin .  So my my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , beginning and end point .  And and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle ,  but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken ,  it would have it would have been hard with the interface that we have .  Now , my a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface ,  but  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Another thing we discussed was um that  Was that um there m there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written , that uh handle bleedthrough ,  I mean cuz you have this this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .  So , some thought of maybe having  Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .  That 's what we were discussing .  Is this proprietary ?  Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt ,  or is it ?  No .  OK .  Right .

",
Bmr005.B,"So so in the tw twelve minutes , um , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i Um , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps .  Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or ?  More than  How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?  The overlaps .  OK .  I 'm not sure .  I think it 's an empirical question .  I think we could find that out .  I 'm I 'm not sure that the beginning had more .  Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that ,  or is it a different type of reverberation ?  The a apparently I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course .  Um  but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings .  She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form .  I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say .  So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something .  It won't be that many people who do it that often ,  but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .  It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .  But I but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .  Wow !  Yeah , we need to I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,  and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions .  So I think that we 'll need to adjust some  And also if we wanna add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through .  I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection .  There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh , you know , friends ,  and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to ,  right ?  You could do this ,  you know . You could .  It seems like you could hold some meetings .  You know , you and maybe Adam ?  You you could you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted .  I agree .  And Mari also ,  we had This came up when she she was here .  That 's important .  Well , you know , I I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .

Bmr005.B,"But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,  but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial .  I mean , we could political discussions , or or something or other ,  and  i you know , people who are  Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d  it 's like , you know , the the uh goldibears goldi goldilocks ,  it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small .

Bmr005.C,"Oh , OK .  Oh .  Sure .  But he can use text , basically .  I mean , he 's talking about just using text  pretty much ,  or ?  OK .  Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun  I believe it .  Yeah .

Cuz Morgan will say well , "" you had some ideas ""  and he never said Li - He looked  Right ,  so it 's great .  So this is really great  because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation ,  I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics .  Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice .  Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when  Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice .  Right .

"" If Person X ""  No , you have to say , you still don't know who "" he "" is , with that prosody .  It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK .  And the downsampling must have been Dan .  It 's an inference .  Overlapping speech .  So there 's a lot of overlap .  So .  But that can include taps .  Actually  Oh , OK .  Oh .  Alright .  But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?  I I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem ,  right ?  But it 's known .  I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation  isn't it ,  over the whole meeting .  So if you wanted to study people overlapping people , that 's not a problem .  Well , not only a word level , but actually  I mean , you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption ,  you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or  Yeah .

Bmr005.C,"I know this sounds tough but we 've got the room set up .  Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use  well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes .  There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription .  So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ?  And I 'm really interested in this but we don't have a whole lot of data .

The the the  I I I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different ,  but eh the the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file .  And so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file , it 's possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system ,  it 's possible you eh in the eh  i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh to nnn to do the experiments with the the system ,  its possible to evaluate eh , eh or to consider eh acoustic events that which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the by the mike .

I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,  and so the tack that we 've taken is more "" lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal "" .  Uh , that 's the party line .  ",
Bmr005.E,"So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .  Um , there was a have been some nice talks recently by by Lucent on on their b  the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me ,  uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . And um , you know , th  Uh so it 's it you have a a direct uh  Uh , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would  um  Yeah .  that would subtract off the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant .  You know , so so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation  Yeah , so you Given that um  Yeah , so you 're trying to So you 'd There 's a a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there ,  and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections .  And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off uh different uh different reflections .  Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something  and then there 's a there 's an echo .  It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .  Well , I 'm I 'm I 'm saying That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . What 's really happening is  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech ,  but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times .  OK ?  So now , if you um try to r you To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons ,  but I but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response ,  but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos .  Um , a number of people have done this  so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it .  So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach .  ","So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .  that would subtract off the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant .  Yeah , so you 're trying to So you 'd There 's a a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there ,  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response ,  but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos .  ",
Bmr005.E,"You say I I I want to use this uh this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos .  So you construct a filter , and you have this this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh gets subtracted off from the original speech .  Then you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense .  And so um uh with some constraints .  It 's a clean up thing . Right .  So , echo cancelling is is , you know , commonly done in telephony ,  and and and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .  Yeah .  Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights ,  and then it 's getting the sum .  So um , uh anyway that 's that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try  somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .  I think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with ,  and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything .  Uh . Um  Brian 's Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma .  Right ?  Which is what I was calling the "" party line "" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want .  We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position ,  and there might be , you know  There 's also um  oh yeah ,  noise .  So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise .  It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays ,  Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos .  But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted  so that it 's decision about what the right you know , right right uh delays are is , uh is right delayed signal is is is uh is incorrect .  And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a in a situation that 's very reverberant with long reverberation times and really long delays , it 's it 's sort of typically impractical .  So for those kind of reasons ,  and also a a c a complete inversion ,  if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .  ","So , echo cancelling is is , you know , commonly done in telephony ,  and and and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .  somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .  ",
Bmr005.E,"Um , that 's difficult because um often times the the um the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable ,  and so , if you you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and and uh goes to infinity .  So it 's so there 's there 's there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical .  So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we we we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion ,  and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion ,  and um we decided to do this approach of taking uh , just picking uh features , which were uh will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation ,  and that 's what Brian was trying to do .  So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was I was gonna bring up .  Uh . Let 's see . I guess you you actually already said this thing about the uh about the consent forms ,  which was that we now don't have to  So this was the human subjects folks who said this , or that that ?  OK .  Um , back on the data thing ,  so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have .  We have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed ,  we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed ,  and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we if this really  uh  Well , do we have that much ?  Let 's see ,  we have  uh eight weeks , uh is  Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's Yeah , so like thirty thirty hours ?  But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .  Right ?  So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .  Yeah , people will get  Yeah , I was gonna mention that .  ","Uh . Let 's see . I guess you you actually already said this thing about the uh about the consent forms ,  We have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed ,  we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed ,  So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .  ",
Bmr005.E,"Yeah . So Yeah . So I I uh , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh , mention to them before that uh there 's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media .  Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , that that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up  and we don't have any say about it  and it 's typically one microphone ,  in a , uh , uh or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the uh characteristics we want .  Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can .  But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say "" hey you have this panel show , or this you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? ""  And uh they may be willing to record it uh with  Well , they probably already use lapel ,  but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .  It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing ,  and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they they they start recording , isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup .  So , I I I I was thinking of looking into that .  the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , uh that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here .  Right .  Yeah .  And and the I mean , the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from I 'll I 'll talk to you more about it later is that is that there 's there 's uh  the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and and permissions and all that .  I mean , they already do what they do do whatever they do .  So it 's uh , it 's So it 's so it 's another source .  So I think it 's something we should look into ,  you know , we 'll collect what we collect here  hopefully they will collect more at UW also  and um and maybe we have this other source .  ","Yeah . So Yeah . So I I uh , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh , mention to them before that uh there 's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media .

So I think it 's something we should look into ,  ",
Bmr005.E,"But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours .  I mean , that was sort of our goal .  The thing was , I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .  And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester .  And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh  Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was  Yeah .  Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,  and and and uh and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things .  Yeah .  i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now  Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing ,  but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .  So that 's  Yeah .  If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @  I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions ,  but I think if it 's a real  Why not ?  Yeah .  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  I I b By the by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .  I think the issue is just that we 're we 're blazing that path .  Right ?  And and um d Do you have any idea when when uh the you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , OK .  So early next week we send it to them ,  and then then we check with them to see if they 've got it  and we we start , you know asking about the timing for it .

Bmr005.E,"So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .  Right ?  Well  Yeah , but You know , so they they they have you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do ,  right ?  But they But at any rate , they 'll I I think once they get that sorted out , they 're they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they who 's who is doing it ,  and uh I think it 's not going to be I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour ,  I think . It 's not going to be thirty  It 's it 's just getting it going .  But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and  Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level .  So then that would double what we had .  Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW  uh I mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,  so .

Um , but , again , Jerry is Jerry 's open  So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting ,  uh Jerry was open to it but I I s  One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week .  You know ? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh are gonna feel a little bit constrained .  Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time .  And the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and  But but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that .  And I I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio .

Bmr005.E,"because because because we would be asking them to do something different .  Right , that 's the found data idea .  But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .  And u I think routinely they would not do this .  So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere  and uh  But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it .

Bmr005.G,"So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working .  And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash .  So , I won't do that anymore .  No .  I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .  So  So they should be right  with what 's on the digit forms .  OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits .  u  And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .  And I 'm surprised I sort of I 'm surprised I forgot that ,  but uh I think that would be a good thing to add .  After I just printed out a zillion of them .  You wanna just go around ?  Hmm , metaphorically .  So , do you think his interest is in using this as a data source ,  or training material ,  or what ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Wrong ,  yeah .

Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel  and And  Yeah .  And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face .  I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying "" we 're ahead of the game "" in that in that context ,  I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .

Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis  and it would be very hard to tell .  Uh .  Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ?  Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking ,  now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking ,  I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .

Bmr005.G,"Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization .  If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name .

Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail .  So .  Mm - hmm .  So it was  Well You weren't talking about just overlaps  were you ?  You were just talking about acoustic events .  Someone starts , someone stops  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , God !  Ugh .  Well So let 's  So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time ,  and then Liz starts talking also over all of us .  How many events would that be ?  So , two people are talking , and then a third person starts talking .  Is there an event right here ?  So i if two or more people are talking .  Well , but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two .  So . You had to start somewhere .  Yep .  That 's a lot of overlap ,  yeah ,  for forty - five minutes .  Silence starting or silence ending  Yep .  Right .  Right .  Right .  The the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription .  So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here  I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM .

Bmr005.G,"and it , uh  and so but it 's it 's doing something very , very simple .  It just takes a threshold , based on on the volume ,  um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs .

Yeah ,  and I haven't tried using that .  It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that .  It 's a cross - correlation filter .

That was with zero literature search .  That 's good validation .  Yeah , do you have a patent on it ?  Just output .  Although if you if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter  That 's alright .  I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , sorts of numbers .  I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle .  Middle or end .  Because i we 're we 're dealing with the Uh , in the early meetings ,  we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , and things like that ,  and that seems to be a lot of overlap .

No , my my But this is too big for my head .  So , I mean , it doesn't you know , it 's sit  OK .  No this way .  Yeah .  Right .  I already tried to get it close .  OK .  Actually if you run , though , on a close - talking mike over the whole meeting , during all those silences , you get , like , four hundred percent word error .  Or or some high number .  Yeah .  Where you know who the speaker is and there 's no overlap ?  And you do just the far - field for those regions ?  Right . I understand that .  I just meant that so you have three choices .  There 's , um You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were were synchronized .  Or you can do a forced alignment on the close - talking to determine that , the you know , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking  and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping  and just front - end those pieces .  Or you can run it on the whole data ,  which is which is , you know , a  In the H L T paper we took segments that are channel time - aligned ,  which is now h being changed in the transcription process ,  which is good ,  and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here ,  because no one else had time any words in that segment  and called that "" non - overlap "" .  Yes .  Tho - good the good numbers .  The bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap .  Yeah .  Right . So we we can do that .  Yeah .  Right .  It might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the PZM ?  I don't know how different they are from each other .  To be best  f  OK .  So we would then use that one , too ,  or ?  Well , yeah . You could look at , I guess , that PZM or something .  And aren't these pretty bad microphones ?  I mean  I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose .  Cheap in terms of their quality .  So .  Mm - hmm .  I see .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Uh  Oh .  Yes , we have  I don't know ,  did you wanna talk about it ,  or ?  I can give a I was just telling this to Jane  ","In the H L T paper we took segments that are channel time - aligned ,  and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here ,  and called that "" non - overlap "" .  The bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap .  ",
Bmr019.A,"and and W we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring  and um ,  some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition ,  which is a um , I think was both a a pruning problem  and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations .  And so we tried both of these st things .  We tried saying  I don't know ,  I got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data , that when people talk their words are usually chunked together .  It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together .  They 're might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ?  But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average .  So , um  And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too too severe .  Actually it was better with slightly better or about th  it was the same with tighter pruning .  It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that that you don't lose anything .  Right .  Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true ,  and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this ,  where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that  things like words that do occur just by themselves a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it  those would be able to do that ,  but the rest would be constrained .  So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers .  I don't know yet about the non - native speakers .  And , um ,  we basically also made noise models for the different sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together .  Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model .  And we also  There was some neat or , interesting cases ,  like there 's one meeting where , um , Jose 's giving a presentation  and he 's talking about , um , the word "" mixed signal ""  and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying "" mixed ""  I think , Morgan .  And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal .  And the next turn was a lot of people saying "" mixed "" ,  like "" he means mixed signal "" or "" I think it 's mixed "" .

Bmr019.A,"And the word "" mixed "" in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times .  And Chuck 's on the lapel here ,  and he also says "" mixed ""  but it 's at the last one ,  and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's "" mixed "" ,  cuz there 's no adaptation yet .  So there 's I think there 's some issues about u  We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker .  But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker ,  and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model .  Like , it gives you some weird alignments ,  just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker .  So there 's some things there ,  especially when you get lots of the same words , uh , occurring in the  Right . I mean , in general we actually  Right now the words like partial words are reject models  and you normally allow those to match to any word .  But then the background speech was also a reject model ,  and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between  you know , it needs to differentiate between the two .  So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues .  And another one is turns , like people starting with "" well I think ""  and someone else is "" well how about "" .  So the word "" well "" is in this in this segment multiple times ,  and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it .  But then that constraint of sort of uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general .  Right now it 's a kluge .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I looked at them .  I spent two days um , in Waves  Oh , it was painful  because the thing is , you know the alignments share a lot in common ,  so  And you 're yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech .  I mean , a lot of them have a lot of words .  Not by every speaker  but by some speaker there 's a lot of words .  No , not  I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words ,  but altogether you 'll see a lot of words up there .  And so the reject is also mapping and pauses  So I looked at them all in Waves  and just lined up all the alignments ,  and , at first it sort of looked like a mess  and then the more I looked at it , I thought "" OK , well it 's moving these words leftward  ","We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker .

So I can have two foreground speakers ,  you know , Morgan an and um , Adam and Jane could all be talking ,  and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time ,  and then look where they are relative to each other ,  and that 's not really what I heard .

But anyway so I think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those ,  and in those same segments just use one of the P Z  And then , you know , I mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on on that particular set ,  uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ?  Or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ?  Uh  Well  This is kind of central .  You know , it 's so i but I would I 'd pick that one .  It 'll be less good for some people than for other ,  but I I 'd like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing on .  Right ?  That 's probably one of the reasons .  But the other is , it 's very , uh I mean , even though there 's I 'm sure the f f the the SRI , uh , front - end has some kind of pre - emphasis , it 's it 's , uh still , th it 's picking up lots of low - frequency energy .  So , even discriminating against it , I 'm sure some of it 's getting through .  Um .  But , yeah , you 're right .  Prob - a part of it is just the distance .  Well , they 're bad .  But , I mean , if you listen to it , it sounds OK . You know ?  u Yeah .  Well , they 're twenty - five cents or so .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But , I mean , the thing is people use those little mikes for everything  because they 're really not bad .  I mean , if you 're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer , they they they you know , you can hear the sou hear the sounds just fine .  You know , it 's  They I mean , i it 's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under ,  it 's just that there 's less quality control .  They just , you know , churn them out and don't check them .  Um . So .  So that was Yeah . So that was i interesting result .  ","And that 's what we were getting those numbers from .

And then , um , from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK .  I think that 's the key thing .  And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there .

We have two .  Oh , good .  Good !  Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah .  OK .  OK .  Yes .  Yes , I did .  And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where not not a lot , but several times I actually moved an utterance from Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's .  So there was some speaker identif  And the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before uh , before we had the multiple audio available  f  so I couldn't switch between the audio .  I I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely ,  which meant in overlaps , I was at a at a terrific disadvantage .  In addition it was before the channelized , uh , possibility was there .  And finally I did it using the speakers of my , um of you know , off the CPU on my on my machine  cuz I didn't have a headphone .  So it @ @ , like , I mean  Yeah , I I mean , i in retrospect it would 've been good to ha have got I should 've gotten a headphone .

So , with under um , uh , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , I got Adam 's voice confused with Dan 's and vice versa  not for long utterances ,  but jus just a couple of places ,  and embedde embedded in overlaps .  The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal ,  which , you know , I mean , you c not not too surprising .

I I did look that up .  I couldn't remember whether that was TI - digits or one of the other digit tasks .  Mm - hmm .  So , Morgan , you 're getting a little breath noise .  You might wanna move the mike down a little bit .  Yeah , I noticed the script that extracted it .  Yep .  Yep .  That I don't know .  I don't know .  I don't know how many speakers there are ,  and and how many speakers per utterance .  Right .  I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do .  So , uh  Right .

I might have to do that anyway to to do  because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right .  The other thing is , isn't TI - digits isolated digits ?  Or is that another one ?  I 'm I looked through a bunch of the digits t corp corpora ,  and now they 're all blurring .  Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit .

And we know  Di - did I send you some results without adaptation ?  Yeah , I think I did , actually .  So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation .  Um .  A a a couple percent or some  I mean  Well , I don't know it Overall  Uh , I I don't remember ,  but there was there was a significant , um , loss or win from adaptation with with adaptation .  And , um ,  that was the phone - loop adaptation .  And then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to the recognition hypotheses .

I could and they are using a system that 's , um you know , h is actually trained on digits ,  um , but h h otherwise uses the same , you know , decoder , the same , uh , training methods , and so forth ,  and I could ask them what they get on TI - digits .

Bmr019.F,"But remember , we 're using a telephone bandwidth front - end here , uh , on this , uh on this SRI system ,  so , um , I was I thought that maybe that 's actually a good thing  because it it gets rid of some of the uh , the noises ,  um , you know , in the the below and above the um , the , you know , speech bandwidth  and , um ,  I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data .

It 's it 's easy enough to try ,  just run it on  Now , eh , does  one one issue  one issue with with that is that um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , both in , uh , mean and variance normalization  and also in the VTL estimation .  So  Do y ?  Is ?  So does so th so does does , um , the TI - digits database have speakers that are known ?

But it 's not the amount of speakers ,  it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker .  Right .  Right .  So  OK .  The key  So th the system actually extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names .  And there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script .  So there 's this one script that parses waveform names  and extracts things like the , um , speaker , uh , ID  or something that can stand in as a speaker ID .  So , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , um , in the in the , uh , um , TI - digits database .

Bmr019.F,"By the way , I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them by , um , not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting .

And then you use those adapted models , which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous you know , channel adapted  use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation .

Bmr019.F,"So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on .  Um .  Just sort of t to make sure that we can do that  and Um .  It 's uh , I mean , the the front - end is f i tha that 's in the SRI recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly  but it unfortunately is not designed and , um like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command .  So , the what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , uh , dump out , um  you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files  and give those files to the recognizer .  OK .  Oh , OK .  Alright .  Yeah , the the the cumbersome thing is is , um is that you actually have to dump out little little files .  So for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file .  Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments ,  but instead you have sort of feature file segments .  But , you know  So .  So that 's actually interesting .  The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition .

So for free recognition , this the lower pruning value is better .  You  Correct .  Right .  Um , but it turned out for for to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly .

That is Actually , no , you do that before you merge the various channels .  So you you id identify by some criterion ,  which is pause length  you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts ,  and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight .

",
Bro018.A,"so I 'm gonna do a similar thing with with support vector machines  and see if  Um . So , support vector machines are are good with dealing with a less amount of data  and um so if you if you give it less data it still does a reasonable job in learning the the patterns .  Um and um  Yeah .  Um .  Right .  So , the the simple idea behind a support vector machine is um , you have you have this feature space ,  right ?  and then it finds the optimal separating plane , um between these two different um classes ,  and um and so um ,  what it i at the end of the day , what it actually does is it picks those examples of the features that are closest to the separating boundary ,  and remembers those  and and uses them to recreate the boundary for the test set .  So , given these um these features , or or these these examples , um , critical examples , which they call support f support vectors , then um given a new example , if the new example falls um away from the boundary in one direction then it 's classified as being a part of this particular class  and otherwise it 's the other class .  Mm - hmm .  Um . Hmm .  Let 's see .  Uh .  Yeah , that 's a good question .  I  yeah .  Right .  I it can be a a reduced um parameterization of of the the model by just keeping certain selected examples .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah , I don't know either .  Actually you don't get a you don't get a nice number between zero and one .  You get you get either a zero or a one .  Um , uh  there are there are pap  Well , basically , it 's it 's um you you get a distance measure at the end of the day ,  and then that distance measure is is um is translated to a zero or one .  Um .  That 's for classification ,  right .  Right .  You have the distances to work with ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , they they had a had a way to translate the distances into into probabilities with the with the simple um uh sigmoidal function .  Um Yeah ,  there 's some there 's like one over one plus the exponential or something like that .  Yeah .  Right .  Oh  I 'm not do I 'm not planning on doing speech recognition with it .  I 'm just doing detection of phonological features .  So uh for example , this this uh feature set called the uh sound patterns of English um is just a bunch of um binary valued features .  Let 's say , is this voicing , or is this not voicing ,  is this sonorants , not sonorants ,  and stuff like that .  So .  ",,
Bro018.A,"Oh !  Uh I haven't gone through the entire table , yet .  Yeah ,  yesterday I brought Chuck the table  and I was like , "" wait , this is Is the mapping from N to to this phonological feature called um "" coronal "" ,  is is should it be shouldn't it be a one ?  or should it should it be you know coronal instead of not coronal as it was labelled in the paper ?

Right ,  um to come up with a mapping from um MFCC 's or s some feature set , um to uh w to whether there 's existence of a particular phonological feature .

I 'm not I 'm not planning to do any any phoneme mapping yet .  Just it 's it 's basically it 's it 's really simple , basically a detection of phonological features .  Yeah ,  and um cuz the uh  So King and and Taylor um did this with uh recurrent neural nets ,  and this i their their idea was to first find a mapping from MFCC 's to uh phonological features  and then later on , once you have these phonological features , then uh map that to phones .

Bro018.B,"S do you get some kind of number between zero and one at the output ?  Uh s So Barry , if you just have zero and ones , how are you doing the speech recognition ?  Oh . OK .  OK .  OK .

Due to Avendano , I 'm taking s um six seconds of speech ,  um I 'm using two second FFT analysis frames , stepped by a half second  so it 's a quarter length step  and I I take that frame and four f the four I take  Sorry ,  I take the current frame and the four past frames and the four future frames  and that adds up to six seconds of speech .

Bro018.B,"O one thing I 'm wondering about is what this mean subtraction method um will do if it 's faced with additive noise .

Bro018.C,"OK .  So uh , he 's not here ,  so you get to  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , I I 'm I 'm slightly confused .  What what feeds the uh the three - output net ?  No no , what feeds it ?  What features does it see ?  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  You wouldn't do like R - one over R - zero or something like that ?  I mean usually for voiced - unvoiced you 'd do yeah , you 'd do something you 'd do energy  but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like R - one ov over R - zero or something like that .  R correlations .  Ye - Well that 's the variance ,  but if you just say "" what is ""  I mean , to first order , um  yeah one of the differences between voiced , unvoiced and silence is energy .  Another one is but the other one is the spectral shape .  Yeah ,  and so R - one over R - zero is what you typically use for that .  No ,  I 'm saying that 's what people us typically use .  See , because it because this is this is just like a single number to tell you um "" does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that "" .  Right ?  So if it 's if it 's um if it 's low energy uh but the but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence .  Uh but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that , it 's probably unvoiced .  So if you just if you just had to pick two features to determine voiced - unvoiced , you 'd pick something about the spectrum like uh R - one over R - zero , um and R - zero  or i i you know you 'd have some other energy measure  and  like in the old days people did like uh zero crossing counts .  Right . S  S  Yeah .  Um ,  Yeah .

"
Bro018.C,"if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one .  So just having the three output thing doesn't doesn't really buy you anything .  The issue is what you feed it .  So uh  w W well that 's another way .  That wasn't what I was saying  but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do .  No I was just trying to say if you b if you bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ?  And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um based on whether you feed it something different .  And something different in some fundamental way .  And so the kind of thing that that she was talking about before , was looking at something uh ab um something uh about the difference between the the uh um log FFT uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh F F - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank .  And so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch  and she 's saying  you know trying  So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference ,  but that might not be the right number .  Right ?  I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's that 's not enough  or maybe there 's something else that that one could use ,  but I think that , for me , the thing that that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here ,  so here 's here 's an idea .  uh What about it you skip all the all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ?  This is f  You have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and and c c computing the variance .  That 's a clever thing to do .  What if you stopped being clever ?  And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful  and figure out what they can what they most need from things , and I mean that 's what they 're good at .  So I mean you 're you 're you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should we should get about this difference  but uh in fact , you know maybe just feeding this in or or feeding both of them in  you know , another way , saying let it figure out what 's the what is the interaction ,  especially if you do this over multiple frames ?  ",,
Bro018.C,"Then you have this over time , and and both kinds of measures  and uh you might get uh something better .  Um .  That 's another thing you could do  yeah .  Yeah .  Um .  I mean , it seems to me , if you have exactly the right thing then it 's better to do it without the net  because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this  you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication .  I mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into a net  and have a bunch of nonlinearities in the middle  and train it to get the product of the output and it would work .  But , it 's kind of crazy ,  cuz we know how to multiply  and you you 'd be you know much lower error usually if you just multiplied it out .  But suppose you don't really know what the right thing is .  And that 's what these sort of dumb machine learning methods are good at .  So .  Um .  Anyway .  It 's just a thought .  Yeah ,  it 's probably worth it .  Is that maybe that 's accuracy ?  Yeah , voiced - unvoiced hopefully would be a lot better .  I think at the frame level for fifty - six that was the kind of number we were getting for for uh um reduced band width uh stuff .  That 's all ?  That 's pretty bad .  Aha !  Aha !  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  But even i in  Oh yeah , in training .  Still ,  Uh .  Well actually , so this is a test that you should do then .  Um , if you 're getting fifty - six percent over here ,  uh that 's in noise also ,  right ?  Oh OK .  If you 're getting fifty - six here , try adding together the probabilities of all of the voiced phones here and all of the unvoiced phones  and see what you get then .  I bet you get better than sixty - three .  OK , but that 's a That is a a good check point ,  you should do that anyway ,  OK ?  Given this this uh regular old net that 's just for choosing for other purposes , uh add up the probabilities of the different subclasses and see see how well you do .

I I don't know if there are many people who are going to ICASSP  so so I thought , make sure somebody go .

Just briefly , or Or anything else ?  Actually , let me  Hold that thought .  Let me back up while we 're still on it .  The the other thing I was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count  and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete HMM  cuz that 'd be pretty simple  because it 's just Say , if you had ten ten events , uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits ,  and uh so you could make a table that would say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be a thousand by thirty - nine ,  and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the the uh uh uh occ uh count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone ,  and that would give you the likelihood of the of the event given the phone .  And um then just use that in a very simple HMM  and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh wouldn't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or  I mean , it 'd be on the simple side ,  but  uh um  ",So he 's he 's going to ICASSP which is good .  Wanna talk a little bit about what we were talking about this morning ?  ,"The group discussed one members attendance at a conference, and another groups code, which is proving hard to follow. "
Bro018.C,"you know , if uh uh the example I was giving was that if if you had um onset of voicing and and end of voicing as being two kinds of events , then if you had those a all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely right .  So .  um But you 'd get all the other distinctions , you know , randomly wrong .  I mean there 'd be nothing to tell you that .  So um uh  If you just do this by counting , then you should be able to find out in a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of events to to do the kind of level of of uh classification of phones that you 'd like .  So that was that was the idea .  And then the other thing that we were discussing was was um OK , how do you get the your training data .  Cuz uh the Switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years ,  and  uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training .  So , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current TIMIT markings into the markings you want .  And uh it won't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't there from these automatic markings ,  but but  uh it 's uh  Yeah .  Yeah and a short short amount of time ,  just to again , just to see if that information is sufficient to uh determine the phones .  So .  Right .  You can get a little feeling for it that way ,  yeah that is probably right .  I mean uh my my guess would be that this is since TIMIT 's read speech that this would be less of a big deal ,  if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more more of one .  And the other thing would be , say , if you had these ten events , you 'd wanna see , well what if you took two events or four events or ten events or t  and you know , and  and hopefully there should be some point at which having more information doesn't tell you really all that much more about what the phones are .  Uh , you could ,  but the thing is , what he 's talking about here is a uh a translation to a per - frame feature vector ,  so there 's no sequence in that ,  I think .  I think it 's just a  Yeah , but we 're just talking about something simple here , yeah , to see if  Yeah .  Just  ",,
Bro018.C,"You know . The idea is with a with a very simple statistical structure , could you could you uh at least verify that you 've chosen features that are sufficient .  OK , and you were saying something starting to say something else about your your class project , or ?  Yeah .  I guess it  yeah ,  they 're sort of succinct ,  and and they uh  That 's another way of doing it .  Right ? So so it I mean I I guess it 's  You know , it it goes back to nearest - neighbor sort of thing ,  right ?  Um , i i if is it eh w  When is nearest - neighbor good ?  Well , nearest - neighbor good is good if you have lots and lots of examples .  Um but of course if you have lots and lots of examples , then it can take a while to to use nearest - neighbor .  There 's lots of look ups .  So a long time ago people talked about things where you would have uh a condensed nearest - neighbor ,  where you would you would you would pick out uh some representative examples which would uh be sufficient to represent to to correctly classify everything that came in .  I I think s I think support vector stuff sort of goes back to to that kind of thing .  Um .  Yeah .  And th the  You know , um neural net approach uh or Gaussian mixtures for that matter are sort of fairly brute force kinds of things , where you sort of you predefine that there is this big bunch of parameters  and then you you place them as you best can to define the boundaries ,  and in fact , as you know , these things do take a lot of parameters  and and uh if you have uh only a modest amount of data , you have trouble uh learning them .  Um , so I I guess the idea to this is that it it is reputed to uh be somewhat better in that regard .  But I don't know if people have done sort of careful comparisons of this on large tasks or anything .  Maybe maybe they have .  I don't know .  Yeah .  But that 's looking at it for for classification for binary classification ,  right ?  But you have the distances to work with .  Cuz actually Mississippi State people did use support vector machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probabilities .  Yeah ,  and d did they use sigmoid or a softmax type thing ?  And didn't they like exponentiate or something  and then divide by the sum of them ,  or ?  Oh it i  Oh , so it is a sigmoidal .  OK .  Alright .  I mean , they 're OK ,  I I don't I don't think they were earth earth shattering ,  ",,
Bro018.C,"but I think that uh this was a couple years ago ,  I remember them doing it at some meeting ,  and and um I don't think people were very critical because it was interesting just to to try this  and you know , it was the first time they tried it ,  so so the you know , the numbers were not incredibly good  but there 's you know , it was th reasonable .  I I don't remember anymore .  I don't even remember what the task was ,  it was Broadcast News , or something .  I don't know .  Uh - huh .  But a as I was saying , people do get probabilities from these things ,  and and uh we were just trying to remember how they do ,  but people have used it for speech recognition , and they have gotten probabilities .  So they have some conversion from these distances to probabilities .  There 's you have you have the paper ,  right ?  The Mississippi State paper ?  Yeah , if you 're interested y you could look ,  yeah .  I expect you could do that .  That 's probably not what he 's going to do on his class project .  Yeah .

And I was asking if you were going to do redo it uh for PLP with the normalization done as it had been done for the mel cepstrum .  OK .

But  yeah  the I sh think they should be roughly equivalent ,  um  I mean again the Cambridge folk found the PLP actually to be a little better .

Bro018.C,"Uh - huh .  Yeah .  So anyway , there 's stuff there to sort out .  So ,  OK .  Let 's go back to what you thought I was asking you .  Ha !  Oh !  You had the sa same answer anyway .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Um  Yeah , I don't think it 's in there ,  I think it 's in the uh uh uh the filters .  So , the F F T is on everything ,  but the filters  um ,  for instance , ignore the the lowest bins and the highest bins .  And what it does is it it copies  um  The filter bank which is created by integrating over F F T bins .  um  Right .  Yeah ,  it 's bark scale ,  and it 's it it um it actually copies the uh um the second filters over to the first .  So the first filters are always  and you can s you can specify a different number of uh features different number of filters ,  I think ,  as I recall .  So you can specify a different number of filters , and whatever um uh you specify , the last ones are gonna be ignored .  So that that 's a way that you sort of change what the what the bandwidth is .  Y you can't do it without I think changing the number of filters ,  but  Yeah , so the idea is that the very lowest frequencies and and typically the veriest highest frequencies are kind of junk .  And so um  you just for continuity you just approximate them by by the second to highest and second to lowest .  It 's just a simple thing we put in .  And and so if you h  Yeah , I think that 's a fixed thing .  But see see my point ?  If you had If you had ten filters , then you would be throwing away a lot at the two ends .  And if you had if you had fifty filters , you 'd be throwing away hardly anything .  Um , I don't remember there being an independent way of saying "" we 're just gonna make them from here to here "" .  But I I I don't know ,  it 's actually been awhile since I 've looked at it .  Yeah , see I don't know Feacalc at all .  But it calls RASTA with some options ,  and um  But I I think in  I don't know .  I guess for some particular database you might find that you could tune that and tweak that to get that a little better ,  but I think that in general it 's not that critical .  I mean there 's  You can You can throw away stuff below a hundred hertz or so  and it 's just not going to affect phonetic classification at all .  Well , it 's not precisely .  Yeah .  ",,
Bro018.C,"I mean ,  um , um  what you can do is um you can definitely change the the filter bank from being uh a uh trapezoidal integration to a a a triangular one ,  which is what the typical mel mel cepstral uh filter bank does .  And some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that ,  so you certainly could do that easily .  But the fundamental difference ,  I mean , there 's other small differences  Yeah ,  but , you know , as opposed to the log in the other case .  I mean the fundamental d d difference that we 've seen any kind of difference from before , which is actually an advantage for the P L P i uh , I think , is that the the smoothing at the end is auto - regressive instead of being cepstral uh , from cepstral truncation .  So um it 's a little more noise robust .  Um , and that 's that 's why when people started getting databases that had a little more noise in it , like like uh um Broadcast News and so on ,  that 's why c Cambridge switched to PLP I think .  So um  That 's a difference that I don't think we put any way to get around ,  since it was an advantage .  um uh  but we did eh we did hear this comment from people at some point , that um it uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal .  So that is an option in RASTA .  Uh and you can certainly play with that .  But I think you 're probably doing the right thing to look for bugs first .  I don't know .  Could be .  Oh - huh !  Oh !  He he He used the identical pruning thresholds even though the s the range of p of the likeli  Oh well that 's That 's a pretty good point right there .  Yeah .  I would think that you might wanna do something like uh you know , look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But I mean you could uh if if if that looks promising you could , you know , r uh run the overall test set with a with a few different uh pruning thresholds for both ,  and presumably he 's running at some pruning threshold that 's that 's uh , you know gets very few search errors  but is is relatively fast  and  But you may be in the wrong range for the P L P features for some reason .  Yeah .  Yeah , maybe just be different kind of distributions  and and  yeah  so that 's another possible thing .  They they should really shouldn't  There 's no particular reason why they would be exactly behave exactly the same .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah .  ",,
Bro018.C,"Yeah .  I guess this was a little bit off topic , I guess ,  because I was I was thinking in terms of th this as being a a a a core item that once we once we had it going we would use for a number of the front - end things also .  So .  um  Wanna  What 's what 's on  Yeah .  That 's ac actually a little side point is I think that 's the first results that we have uh uh uh of any sort on the far field uh on on the far field data uh for recorded in in meetings .  Did he ?  On the near field , on the ne  Oh did he ?  Oh !  I didn't recall that .  What kind of numbers was he getting with that ?  Five .  So why were you getting forty - one here ?  Is this  No ,  but wait a minute .  I I I th I think he  What am I saying here ?  Yeah ,  so that was the SRI system .  Maybe you 're right .  Yeah .  Cuz it was getting like one percent So it 's still this kind of ratio .  It was it was getting one percent or something on the near field .  Wasn't it ?  Yeah .  Yeah . I think it was getting around one percent for the near for the n for the close mike .  So it was like one to five  So it 's still this kind of ratio .  It 's just  yeah ,  it 's a lot more training data .  So  So probably it should be something we should try then is to is to see if is at some point just to take i to transform the data  and then and then uh use th use it for the SRI system .  So you 're so you have a system which for one reason or another is relatively poor ,  and and uh you have something like forty - one percent error  uh and then you transform it to eight by doing doing this this work .  Um .  So here 's this other system , which is a lot better ,  but there 's still this kind of ratio .  It 's something like five percent error with the the distant mike ,  and one percent with the close mike .  So the question is how close to that one can you get if you transform the data using that system .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  well , it 's it 's not exactly the right thing  but uh but you 've already seen that cuz there is added noise here .  Yeah .  So um  Yeah ,  I mean , as helpful  I mean ,  so that 's the question .  Yeah , w we 're often asked this when we work with a system that that isn't isn't sort of industry industry standard great ,  ",,
Bro018.C,"uh and we see some reduction in error using some clever method ,  then , you know , will it work on a on a on a good system .  So uh  you know , this other one 's it was a pretty good system .  I think , you know , one one percent word error rate on digits is uh digit strings is not uh you know stellar ,  but but given that this is real digits , as opposed to uh sort of laboratory  Well .  And it wasn't trained on this task .  Actually one percent is sort of you know , sort of in a reasonable range .  People would say "" yeah , I could I can imagine getting that "" .  And uh so the the four or five percent or something is is is quite poor .  Uh , you know , if you 're doing a uh a sixteen digit uh credit card number you 'll basically get it wrong almost all the time .  So . So . Uh , um  a significant reduction in the error for that would be great .  And and then , uh  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  Cool .  Yeah .  Alright , um , I actually have to run .  So I don't think I can do the digits ,  but um , I guess I 'll leave my microphone on ?  Yeah .  Thank you .  I can be out of here quickly . That 's  I just have to run for another appointment .

Bro018.E,"but uh , you know , the the models would be all messed up .  So I was going through and just double - checking that kind of think first , to see if there was just some kind of obvious bug in the way that I was computing the features .  Looking at all the sampling rates to make sure all the sampling rates were what eight K , what I was assuming they were ,  um  Yeah .  So I was doing that first , before I did these other things , just to make sure there wasn't something  Yeah ,  and I think , hhh I 'm trying to remember but I think I recall that Andreas was saying that he was gonna run sort of the reverse experiment .  Uh which is to try to emulate the normalization that we did  but with the mel cepstral features .  Sort of , you know , back up from the system that he had .  I thought he said he was gonna  I have to look back through my my email from him .  Yeah ,  he 's gone now .  Um .  But  Right .  Yeah see one thing that 's a little bit um  I was looking I 've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um Andreas created .  And um his uh the way that the S R I system looks like it works is that it reads the wavefiles directly ,  uh and does all of the cepstral computation stuff on the fly .  And , so there 's no place where these where the cepstral files are stored , anywhere that I can go look at and compare to the PLP ones ,  so whereas with our features , he 's actually storing the cepstrum on disk , and he reads those in .  But it looked like he had to give it uh  even though the cepstrum is already computed , he has to give it uh a front - end parameter file .  Which talks about the kind of uh com computation that his mel cepstrum thing does ,  so i I I don't know if that it probably doesn't mess it up ,  it probably just ignores it if it determines that it 's already in the right format or something  but the the the two processes that happen are a little different .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah  no and I didn't have a chance to do that .  Yeah .  Yeah . I 've been um , I 've been working with um Jeremy on his project  and then I 've been trying to track down this bug in uh the ICSI front - end features .  So one thing that I did notice , yesterday I was studying the um the uh RASTA code  and it looks like we don't have any way to um control the frequency range that we use in our analysis .  ",,
Bro018.E,"We basically it looks to me like we do the FFT , um and then we just take all the bins  and we use everything .  We don't have any set of parameters where we can say you know , "" only process from you know a hundred and ten hertz to thirty - seven - fifty "" .  At least I couldn't see any kind of control for that .  The the filters ?  Which filters ?  Mm - hmm .  When you get the mel When you go to the mel scale .  I saw something about uh that looked like it was doing something like that , but I didn't quite understand it .  So maybe  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  But so the but that 's a fixed uh thing ?  There 's nothing that lets you  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Use this analysis bandwidth or something .

But um I didn't quite understand everything that I saw ,  so  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  Another thing I was thinking about was um is there a  I was wondering if there 's maybe um certain settings of the parameters when you compute PLP which would basically cause it to output mel cepstrum .  So that , in effect , what I could do is use our code  but produce mel cepstrum  and compare that directly to  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  There 's a cubic root that happens ,  right ?  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah just it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by you know s some of the training data being messed up .  You know , you 're sort of getting most of the way there , but there 's a  So I started going through and looking  One of the things that I did notice was that the um log likelihoods coming out of the log recognizer from the PLP data were much lower , much smaller ,  than for the mel cepstral stuff , and that the average amount of pruning that was happening was therefore a little bit higher for the PLP features .  So , since he used the same exact pruning thresholds for both , I was wondering if it could be that we 're getting more pruning .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Yeah ,  so  That 's  Right .  Well , what I was gonna do is I was gonna take um a couple of the utterances that he had run through ,  then run them through again  but modify the pruning threshold and see if it you know , affects the score .  So .  ",,
Bro018.E,"Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right . I mean , yeah , generally in these things you you turn back pruning really far ,  so I I didn't think it would be that big a deal  because I was figuring well you have it turned back so far that you know it  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And the uh the the run time of the recognizer on the PLP features is longer  which sort of implies that the networks are bushier ,  you know , there 's more things it 's considering  which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good .  So uh , you know , it could be that we 're just pruning too much .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . Right .  Right .  So .  There 's lots of little differences .  So .  Uh .  Trying to track it down .  Yeah  Mm - hmm .  On on the real data , not with artificial reverb ?  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm ,  or it wa a it was around one .  Yeah .  It 's trained on a lot of different things .  Um .  It 's trained on uh a lot of Switchboard , Call Home ,  um a bunch of different sources ,  some digits ,  there 's some digits training in there .  And it wasn't trained on this task either .  Uh , yeah .  Yep .  Yeah .  That 'll work .  ",,
