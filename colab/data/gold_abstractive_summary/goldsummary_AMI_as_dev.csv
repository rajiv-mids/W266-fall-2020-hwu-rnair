meeting,abstractive
ES2005a,"The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device. "
ES2005b,"The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition. He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget, and discussed possible materials and programmable features. The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group. The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape. The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design. "
ES2005c,"The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. "
ES2005d,"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead. It was decided that another feature could possibly be added. The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product.

The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required. The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports, finding that products now require technological innovativeness, a fancy look and feel, a spongy feel, and a fruit and vegetable theme. This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote. The team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote. "
ES2007d,"The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained. In presenting the prototype, the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost. The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, costs, and its ability to be misplaced. Overall, the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they we
re happy with their product and their performance in the project. "

The team then discussed other options for how they could incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the appearance of their product. The team then discussed other options for batteries, chips, buttons, and materials for the case, as well as the option to have a menu function. "
ES2008d,"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project, the information they found and used, their creativity, their teamwork, and the materials they had at their disposal. The team was generally quite satisfied. After the project manager's closing, the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned. "
ES2015a,"The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group. She then states the agenda of the meeting and tells them that they will be designing and creating a new remote control that should be trendy and user-friendly. The meetings will focus on functional, conceptual, and detailed design. Next, each group member draws their favorite animal on the whiteboard and explains the characteristics of that animal. After that the project manager covers the project budget, and then they begin discussing their personal experiences with remote controls and how they want their remote to look. Then the project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what to do in preparation for the next meeting. "
ES2015b,"The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first. The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique, such as visibility in the dark, locator alarm, and environmentally-friendly materials. To make an environmental impact, they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled. The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote. The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget. The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users. She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly, unique design since certain features could be too complex. The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management, which she shares with the group. They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting. "
ES2015c,"The project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda. The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote, energy source options, and materials for the remote, case, and buttons. The interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface. They decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user-friendly. The group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons. The marketing expert presents on trend-watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year, and says the material used is expected to be spongy. The group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design, then finalizes a few decisions about the components, materials, and energy sources. The project manager closes the meeting, stating what each member's next task will be. "
ES2015d,"The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The designers give the prototype presentation, showing their simple design that is based on a mango. They point out the company logo and LED, and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. They also discuss the numerical, volume, channel, and power buttons as well as the color scheme. The marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7. The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel, technological innovation, ease of use, look, whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it, whether its operating behavior matches the average user, ease of finding when lost, ease of learning to use, whether it will minimize RSI, incorporation of company colors and logo, and whether it follows the motto. They average the scores and get 1.9. They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros. In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity, leadership, timing, teamwork, discussions, and overall product given the resources they had. They close the meeting by thanking one another. "
IS1003a,The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals. 
IS1003c,"The User Interface Designer presented three different concepts to consider for the user interface and introduced the idea of using speech recognition in the design of the remote. The team discussed the issue of using speech recognition at length. The Industrial Designer presented possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, introduced the option of using a solar battery, and discussed options for buttons. The Marketing Specialist  discussed recent findings from trend watching reports. The team discussed what materials to use and their interface concept. "
IS1003d,"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. The team decided that the prototype required further work. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. In discussing the production costs, the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote, while staying within the boundaries of their budget, and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product. The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product. "
IS1004a,"The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting. The rest introduce themselves, including Michael the interface designer, Guillermo the marketing expert, and Hemant the industrial designer. The project manager states the goal of the project, which is to develop a new remote control. It should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. He also mentions the three-step project- functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. Then they take turns drawing their favorite animal on the white board. After that they briefly discuss finances. The remote control's target selling price of twenty-five Euro dollars and will be for the international market. They need to generate a profit of fifty million Euros. The question of whether the remote control should be for a specific device was brought up but not answered. The project manager closes the meeting, telling each group member what he is responsible for and reminding them that they will receive more information by email. "
IS1004b,"The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific. He suggests they name the project and they come up with ""mando"", meaning ""control"" in Spanish. The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes. He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD, which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation. The industrial designer presents, showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing. He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size, suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it. They discuss voice recognition again, and then the interface specialist presents. He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price. They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on. "
IS1004c,"The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design. He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. Then they move on to the three presentations. The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends. They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. Next, the user interface specialist presents. He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. They have the option of using that technology. He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have. Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. The user could simply press a button on the base station and the remote control would start beeping. Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control. He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. They agree on having base station with the remote. They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver. After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV. "
IS1004d,"The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote. They go through the evaulations, using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one. Next they do a cost estimate for production. In doing this, they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow. They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting. "
IS1006a,"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal. After the drawing exercise, the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design. The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold. The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce. The team members discussed child proof capabilities, color options, how to adapt a remote for left-handed users, a ""go back"" function, the size of a remote, buttons, and LCD screens. The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team. "
IS1006b,"The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members. The marketing expert discussed the findings of a survey which indicated that current remotes are ugly, difficult to use, have a number of unused buttons, frustrate users when misplaced, and contribute to RSI. The marketing expert also stated that young users like speech recognition and that users in general want buttons for power, channel selection, volume control, and a few lesser used settings. The user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the need for simpler designs, discussed the use of components such as titanium and a back-lit LCD screen, and discussed other features to consider such as color options. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and how to handle universal capability and speech recognition. After the project manager's closing, the project manager recapped some decisions and the team discussed how to handle the issue of locating a remote when misplaced. "
IS1006c,"The project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, case materials and shapes, chips, and interface components and also discussed the components necessary for a speech recognition capable remote control. The user interface designer presented his concept for the interface design which he called the ""millennium remote control"". The user interface designer also discussed with the team color options and how to make a ""smart"" remote which is in tune with the user's preferences. The marketing expert discussed current findings from trend watching reports which indicated that there is a desire for products to have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, and be spongy. The project manager gave the team members their assignments and then the team went over the decisions they had made and discussed whether to use titanium or rubber in their design. "
IS1006d,"This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. It was designed to be powered by a single battery. The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. "
TS3004a,"The Project Manager introduced himself and the project to the group. He presented an agenda for the rest of the project. The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the board. The Project Manager discussed the projected price point, profit aim, and production cost for the project. The group discussed their initial ideas about the product design. They decided to make the remote a universal remote. They discussed the form of the device; it was suggested that the device could have a folding-open design or a touch-screen interface. They discussed energy source options and could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand. They also discussed how to make the remote look more unique; it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification and to research which devices the remote will control. "
TS3004b,"The Project Manager announced that the remote should only control television, and that the marketing should be targeted towards ages 40 and above. The Marketing Expert presented the results of a lab study on users of remote controls, and showed that users want a fancier, less complicated remote that does not get lost easily. The group decided not to use speech recognition or an LCD screen to target the older demographic. The User Interface Designer discussed the button functions and how to make channel-changing easier. The group decided not to include programmable ""favorites"" buttons. The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of the device. The group discussed having the remote light up when used. He also stressed that the remote must be compatible with all television brands. The Project Manager corrected his target group announcement and announced that the target age group was actually ages 40 and below. The group again discussed the possibility of adding speech recognition and LCD screens to the design but decided that it was not feasible. The group decided to have the remote light up when used and is including teletext. The Marketing Expert was instructed to report on trendwatching. "
TS3004c,"The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Marketing Expert gave a trendwatching report. He found that a fancy look and feel was most important for users. He also discussed the trend towards spongy materials. The group discussed the cost of adding speech recognition, the LCD screen, and the advanced chip. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the interface with the group. They discussed the placement and design of the buttons and decided to use scroll wheels for volume. The Industrial Designer advised that flashy colors and rounded shapes be used. The group discussed how to incorporate the logo and including changeable faces. They discussed materials for the buttons and the backlight. The group decided to use rechargeable batteries and a stand, to use plastic for the casing and buttons, and to not include an LCD screen. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to draw the prototype at the next meeting, and the User Interface Designer was instructed to finalize the button placement. The group finalized the look of the product, and eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip. "
TS3004d,"The project manager presented the agenda and the minutes from the previous meeting. The group discussed speech recognition , whether the remote should slide open or fold open, and what type of chip they should use. The designers presented the prototype, which resembles an ipod in appearance, and is made of transparent coloured plastic. The colours will be changeable. The remote has both buttons and a scroll wheel. The number buttons have a back-light. The group discussed adding extra buttons/functions. The prototype was evaluated and received an average overall score of 1.8. The project manager went through the finances, and the total cost came to 12.3 euros, although this did not include the cost of the recharger, which was not on the price list. The group evaluated the project process, and were generally pleased with their creativity and teamwork, but were unsatisfied with the equipment. "
TS3005a,"The project manager acquainted the team with the tools and equipment around them and then had the team members introduce themselves by name and what role they had in the project. The project manager then introduced the upcoming project along with more tools and equipment to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals. After the drawing exercise, the project manager talked about the project finances and production costs. The team then discussed their experiences with remotes and various features to consider when producing a remote. "
TS3005b,"The project manager opened the meeting and then the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote along with his personal preferences for the appearance of a remote. The user interface designer discussed the technical functions of a remote and indicated that a user centered approach to designing the interface would be preferable. The marketing expert discussed the functional requirements of a remote and user tendencies in using remotes. The marketing expert indicated that an ideal remote would include an LCD screen, would not be too small in size, and is easy to use. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion in which the team discussed their target group and made decisions on the appearance and functions of their upcoming product. "
TS3005c,"After the project manager opened the meeting, the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved, made of rubber, contains an LCD, has a docking station to recharge the batteries, and uses a simple chip. The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes, the layout of the interface, and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features. The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people. The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, in fruity colors, in soft and spongy materials, and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people. The team discussed case shapes, color options, types of rubber, and dimensions. The team then made decisions regarding energy sources, components, and the remote interface. "
TS3005d,"The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen, a scroll button, and a battery indicator. The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype. The team found the remote to be fancy, innovative, fairly easy to use, available in different colors, fairly spongy, difficult to misplace, and targeted to younger people. The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote. The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design. The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process. The team found the project stressful, the equipment useful, the information available to them lacking, and their laptops to be slow and heavy. "
TS3006a,"When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project, which is to develop a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it. The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion. They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group. They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote, including medium size buttons, small unit, and work within a good zapping range. The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV. They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video, but allowing the possibility to add more features. They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do. "
TS3006b,"The marketing expert reported on research which shows that users think most remotes are ugly, easily lost and bad for RSI. Audio settings are rarely used, and the power, channel and volume buttons are used most often. The remote should be user-friendly and have a good look and feel. The marketing expert and project manager described the new requirements that the target group is users under 40, the remote should not include teletext, should be only for TV, and should feature the corporate logo. The user interface designer showed examples of two contrasting remotes, recommending that they should use the best features of both. The group decided to use an LCD screen and speech recognition. The industrial designer described how a remote works, and explained that his presentation was incomplete because he had not received the necessary information in time. The group discussed what functions to include and the layout of the remote, and the marketing expert drew a possible design on the board. They decided to have buttons for the basic functions and make the advanced functions accessible through the screen. They also discussed what buttons would be needed to navigate the menu on the LCD screen. "
TS3006c,"The marketing expert talked about trendwatching and explained that the current trends are for fruit and vegetable themed products and products with a spongy texture. For users, the three most important aspects of a remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and ease of use. The industrial designer talked about the options for energy source, case shape and material, and internal components. The group decided on using kinetic energy, and a double-curved rubber case. The user interface designer talked about speech recognition and what functions will be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu. The project manager ran through the group's decisions so far and led a discussion of their remaining options, including the colour of the case and buttons, and whether the remote should flip open or not. "
TS3006d,"The project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed. The group discussed which features should be dropped. The group decided that the LCD screen was integral to their design, but dropped the speech recognition. They decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push-button, and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation, based on the new design. The group were satisfied with the overall score of 3.1. The industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design, while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report. The project manager led an evaluation of the project process. The group thought that they worked well together, especially after the first meeting. They were happy with the room for creativity, but thought they were limited by the budget. They preferred the digital pens to the SMARTboard.  They had mixed feelings about using PowerPoint. "
TS3008a,"The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops. The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, to design a remote control. The remote should be trendy, original and user friendly. The project manager explained how to use the SMARTboard, and the group did a tool training exercise, using the SMARTboard to draw their favourite animals. The project manager talked about the budget and projected profit. The group discussed initial ideas for the remote, including that it should be a simple design with grouped buttons. They discussed whether the remote should include functions for controlling video and DVD players. The project manager went over the roles of the participants and closed the meeting. "
TS3008b,"The project manager opened the meeting. The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel. He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features. He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost. The project manager informed the group of new requirements. The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan. The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base/recharger with locator function. The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost. "
TS3008c,"The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components. He suggested that the case should be double-curved, and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium. He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power. He also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special. The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote. The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions. The marketing expert gave a presentation on trend watching. A fancy look and feel is most important to users, followed by technological innovation and ease of use. The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material, which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base. The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, as well as the company colours and logo. The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen, and eventually decided against it. The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting. "
TS3008d,"The project manager opened the meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design. The remote has buttons for power, mute, teletext, volume and channel up/down, and nine numbered channel buttons. The group discussed what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. They discussed adapting the docking station so it could be used with other products but did not make a decision. The remote is plastic with different coloured rubber strips on the sides and rubber buttons. The marketing expert led the product evaluation. The group were generally satisfied with the design but did not think the remote was technologically innovative. The overall score was 2.6. The group worked out the manufacturing costs. The group had problems figuring out the cost of the docking station and buttons, and did not know which kind of chip to use. They discussed using kinetic energy to make the remote more technologically innovative but decided against it. They eventually decided that they could not afford a docking station. They did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting. "
TS3011a,"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting. He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals. The project manager then went over the project budget. The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared. The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas. The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices. They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons. However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow. The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth. The project manager closed the meeting. "
TS3011b,"There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 40. The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. The design can focus on such customer needs, like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design. "
TS3011c,"For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups. They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device. Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved. They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources. Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours. "
TS3011d,"The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition. The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design. After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1). Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful). The delay in providing costs of components was criticised. "
