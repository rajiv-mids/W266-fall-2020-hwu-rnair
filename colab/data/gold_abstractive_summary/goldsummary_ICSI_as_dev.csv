meeting,abstractive
Bed002,"The initial task of the EDU group is to work on inferring intentions through context. In the navigational paradigm used for the task, these intentions are to ""see"" to ""enter"" or to ""get to the closest point of"" a building. There will be purpose-designed experiments carried out. However, the starting point is, through the use of existing data, to determine possible linguistic, discourse or situation features that define intentionality. These may include the type of building, time of day, particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native. Initially, these features will be hand-coded, but the goal is to find ways of extracting them automatically from the XML data. Consequently, they will be fed into a belief-net -implemented on a software package like JavaBayes- and the conditional probability of each intention calculated. A prototype system will be put together to test hypotheses regarding both the exact nature of the features and how intentions are derived from them. "
Bed003,"The group discussed the first version of the Bayes-net used to work out a user's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device. Three intentions were identified: Vista (to view), Enter (to visit) and Tango (to approach). The structure of the belief-net comprises, firstly, a feature layer, which includes linguistic, discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data. It is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters( eg ""entrance"", ""type of object"", ""verb""), each one with a separate middle layer. These feed, in turn, into the main middle layer, that defines more general hidden variables, such as the tourist/business status of the user. The feature layer can end up being cue-based, while the middle layers task-based. The latter determine the final probability of each intention in the output layer. This first model of the belief-net was built in JavaBayes, since it is a free package, has a graphical interface, and it can take XML files as input. At this stage, all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded. However, there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments, that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task. "
Bed005,"The data collection running in parallel with the project can start shortly with recruiting subjects. Meanwhile, the german parser now works with english sentences. The parser's output modifies the XML used by the system to initiate actions and generate responses. The XML for Map requests also comprise a route, route elements and points of interest along the way. It is at this level that Enter/Vista/Approach tags will be added as action modes. As the project evolves, further enrichment of the ontology (actions, linguistic features) will be necessary. Similarly, object representations will include an EVA vector. This can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type. These elements will constitute only a small part of the inputs of the Bayes-net that determines the action mode. The actual number of the inputs can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities. Noisy-OR's can help avoid this by simplifying the probability tables and applying a deterministic function to produce their complete version. In any case, further to fulfilling the basic requirements (translating the parser and the generator into english), the project is entirely open-ended in terms of focus of research. "
Bed006,"The data collection script has been slightly modified, so that it encourages more natural dialogue between the subjects and the ""wizard"". Another trial run will take place, while a call to recruit subjects is being emailed to students. Meanwhile, the translation of the TV and cinema information system to english is almost complete. This was the basic requirement of the project. On the other hand, there was a presentation of the model that offers more elaborate action planning for SmartKom, of which Enter/View/Approach (EVA) modes are a part. These modes will form categories of complete XML schemas with information filled in from the language understanding in a more elaborate way than the current Object-""Go Action""-Object model. These categories will, in turn, be linked with action schemas, one of which is Source-Path-Goal (SPG). Categories and action schemas can have -in theory- any number of blocks depending on the expansion of the domain. The notation provides for linking and referencing between different schemas. The model also allows for multiple action schemas to be triggered in parallel. However, the structure of the model is open for discussion, since its use was to elicit discussion and highlight issues. "
Bed008,"A detailed diagram of the belief-net had already been disseminated. Its structure was discussed during the meeting. There are several endpoints (User, Ontology, Discourse etc) with separate EVA (Enter/View/Approach) values. Details of how different inputs feed into them were discussed at length. Ideas mentioned included grouping features of buildings like ""selling"", ""fixing"" and ""exhibiting"", as well as creating a User-compatibility node that would take different values depending on the situation and the user status. Similarly, a Go-there (towards a building) node can be influenced by things like the user's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things. The latter are still ill-defined at this stage. The study of the linguistic constructions that people use in this kind of navigational domain is expected to be prove useful in that respect. As each node in the tree is the decision point of the combination of its parent nodes, which rules govern this combination is an important issue. There are several approaches ranging from simply averaging the inputs to using a hidden variable in order to weight them differently depending on context. If the latter architecture is used, the net could -to an extent- be trained with the data that is currently being collected. "
Bed010,"The translation of SmartKom to english is in its final stages. The synthesis module will be the last one to do, after the english syntax trees are completed. The system is still buggy and unstable, but it will soon be ready for a demonstration. This is the first of two working demos required for the project. Further than that, there are no restrictions on the focus of the research or its possible applications. For example, issues like spatial descriptions could be investigated. The variety of linguistic conventions seem to develop around an ego/allo-centric and a proximal/distal paradigm. The latter is also reflected in neuro-physiological data. From an engineering perspective, the belief-net for the AVE task should be completed within a few weeks. The majority of the nodes are already there. This leaves the dependencies between them and the rules of computation to be set. Since the whole system is going to be re-designed, there are major decisions to be taken regarding the parser and the ontology, as well as what can be re-used from past EML projects. In parallel, another team is working on formalisation and notation. Finally, more ideas are expected to come from students and their research. "
Bed011,"The main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net, its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them, and secondly, on the design of the data collection tasks. For the latter, there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus. It was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks, such as ""big place"", ""service"", etc. could provide a better range of data. The duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes. On the other hand, the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete, although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet. These nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system. Their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction, or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user. Finally, as to the semantic and syntactic constructions, work will start with more general and brief descriptions, before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset. Similarly, the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic, yet robust. "
Bed012,"The focus of the meeting was on a presentation of the work done already on the building of the Bayes-net. The input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models, feeds into a set of decision nodes, such as the Enter/View/Approach (EVA) endpoint. In any particular situation, most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context. Therefore, they will either have to be pruned a posteriori, or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion. The latter option could could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms. In any case, on what basis the ""winner"" output is chosen is not clear. One suggestion was discussed: the particular constructions used can determine the pertinent decision (output) nodes. The complete prototype of the Bayes-net will be presented in the next meeting. After that, it will be possible to define interfaces and a dummy construction parser, in order to test and link modules together. "
Bed013,"An idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager: the possibility to use the same system for language generation. Having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net. Setting up certain inputs in the Bayes-net would imply certain intentions, which would trigger dialogues. There is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm. The focus should be the Bayes-net, to which all other modules interface. Situation, User, Discourse and Ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions. Someone asking where the castle is after having asked about the admission fee, indicates that -given that the castle is open to tourists- they want to go there, as opposed to knowing its whereabouts. It was suggested that they start analysing what the Discourse and Ontology would give as inputs to the Bayes-net by working on simple utterances like ""where is X?"". With this addition, all input layers of the net would be functioning. Although this function would be limited, it would allow for the Bayes-net to be tested in its entirety and, henceforth, extended. "
Bed014,"Minor technical issues,such as format conversions for XML and JavaBayes and the full translation of the SmartKom generation module in English, are currently being resolved. The voice synthesiser will also be replaced by better technology. An important research issue to be investigated is how the concept of mental spaces and probabilistic relational models can be integrated into the belief-net. Mental space interdependencies are based on relatively clean rules, since people seem to manage them easily. A step towards this goal is the construction formalism being put together. This module will eventually have to include ways to simulate questions, do emphasis and focus. The constructions could be built assuming either conventional or conversational implicature. At this stage both routes need to be examined. The formalism will also serve as a starting point for the definition of construal mechanisms. Similarly, issues like time plans and discourse stacks are dependent on how the ontology and discourse history are going to be structured and linked. One suggestion was to use the spreading activation as a paradigm for activating nodes in the belief-net. Finally, using type constraints in the construction analysis should work, as long as they are complex enough not to generate too many parses. "
Bed015,"The discussion concerned the revised semantic specification and the construction formalism. The different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them. The notation maintains properties of both dependency and constituent-based grammars. The encoding of features is still incomplete: frame profiles, focus, adjectives, nominal expressions are phenomena in the process of being integrated. Similarly, ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top. On the other hand, the semantic specification structures information in terms of ""scenario"", ""referent"" and ""discourse segment"". Each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance. It is, essentially, a toolkit with which to create semantic constructions, as well as the bindings between them and with the ontology. Among the issues still being defined, mental spaces and context (eg pronoun references) present similarities that can be echoed in the specification. Work on both of these formalisms will continue with circumscription of the construction space that will be studied in more detail. Work on construal will use Bayes-nets, which will be fed information from other modules and implement general rules to infer how utterances are construed. "
Bed017,"The first phase of the data collection has finished. There is a new wizard for phase two, during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios. Also finished are the modifications on SmartKom: the remaining glitches will take no more than a day to iron out. A big part of the meeting was covered by the presentation of the PRM of the proposed system. An alternative representation of the Bayes-net, it depicts context features as classes, and dependencies as relations between them. The current outputs show the desirability of a site, as well as its EVA mode. The fact that this model allows for instantiations of classes fits the research purposes much better than the extended belief-net. Following this, a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the International University. It attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course. The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results, if they take into account contextual parameters (user, situation). Although no detailed linguistic analysis takes place, it was suggested that the use of FrameNet could be a useful approach. There were also further suggestions for meetings with ICSI researchers. "
Bmr003,"The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the aims, methods, timing, and outsourcing issues concerning transcription of the Meeting Recorder corpus. The Transcriber software tool was introduced, along with a set of transcription conventions for coding different speech events. The prospect of sending the data to an external transcription service was weighed against that of hiring a graduate student transcriber pool. It was tentatively decided that the latter option would be less costly and allow BMR to maintain greater control over the transcription process. Methods for distributing the data were briefly discussed, along with an initiative for creating a BMR project website. The group received an update on the meeting room recording setup and electronics. "
Bmr006,"The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed research aims and corresponding concerns for future data collection. It was agreed that a substantial amount of meeting data is required from different domains, and comprising several speakers, to perform the types of discourse and acoustic analyses desired. Ongoing efforts by speaker mn005 to automatically  detect regions of speaker overlap were considered. It was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters, e.g. energy and harmonics-related features, to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker. Disk space issues were discussed. And, finally, the problem of speaker anonymization was explored. "
Bmr007,"The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group focussed its discussion on overlapping speech segments. Speaker fe008 presented raw counts and percentages for one transcribed meeting, revealing a large number of overlaps throughout the 40-plus-minute transcript. Efforts by speakers fe008 and fe016 are in progress to categorize and subcategorize types of overlapping speech and evaluate the contribution of multiple speakers in an interaction to the amount and types of overlap observed. Speaker me011 described his attempts to automatically identify speakers via the close-talking microphone channels using thresholding and filtering methods and an existing speaker-change detection algorithm. The group also tentatively discussed the erection of visual barriers during meeting recordings, and speaker me013 presented a list of work performed by BMR over the previous three months to be included in a forthcoming report to IBM. "
Bmr013,"The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer. Anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora, i.e. Aurora and TI-digits. The group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of Meeting Recorder digits or Switchboard data. Pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed. Finally, speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the SRI recognizer, including conventions for encoding acronyms, numbers, ambient noise, and unidentified inbreaths. "
Bmr014,"The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed recording equipment issues, including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use. Speaker fe008 presented the current status on transcriptions, and explained procedures for cleaning up transcripts and ensuring they conform with set conventions. Speaker mn014 briefly described his efforts to normalize loudness levels across speech channels to distinguish between foreground and background speech. Finally, the group discussed legal and procedural issues concerning the provision of transcripts to meeting participants for 'bleeping out' any sections of speech they want excluded from the Meeting Recorder database. "
Bmr015,"Topics discussed by the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data, naming conventions for files, speaker identification tags, and encoding files with details about the recording. The group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the NSF's ITR (Information Technology Research) program, transcriptions, and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features. Particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures, i.e. how to deal with overlooked backchannels, and audible breaths. "
Bmr018,"The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the preparation of a data sample for IBM, the manual adjustment of time bins by transcribers, recognition results for a test set of digits data, and forced alignments. Participants also talked about Eurospeech 2001 submissions, and exchanged comments on the proceedings of the recently attended Human Language Technologies conference (HLT'01). Preliminary recognition results were presented for a subset of digits data. Efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments for non-digits data were also discussed. "
Bmr020,"The main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to Eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by IBM. The results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling. Additionally, the high error rate in the recognition of such overlapping speech by the SRI recogniser was minimised simply by changing the scoring method used. Finally, a strong correlation between pauses and interruptions was confirmed. All these measurements were based on the sample of available transcripts. Other features, like prosody, will be studied in the near future. An FTP directory containing such experimental data is being set up for the benefit of other researchers. Regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by IBM, the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them. Suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription, but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications, as there will be extensive in-house post-processing. Within this discussion, the rationale behind the coding of the time bins according to the flow of discourse was also explained. "
Bro023,"The ICSI Meeting Recorder Group of Berkeley met for the first time in two weeks. Group members reported their progress in the areas of spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering and noise estimation. They also discusses topics relating to the rules and preferences of the project they are working on, including single vs multiple passes. A number of the group also took time to explain the basics of their approaches to the group. There are hopes that a visitor coming for three weeks, may lead to a longer term collaboration. "
Bro024,"Another weekly meeting on ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley, though the members are joined by a visiting researcher. The groups regulars reported progress on their work on mean subtraction, noise estimation, voice activity detection and the Vector Taylor Series. While on these topics, related areas discussed included recognition window length, training versus test set sizes, artificial distortion and latency concerns. "
Bro025,"ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group have returned from a meeting with some important decisions to make. They have developed a piece of software which allows them to implement their two main approaches to dealing with noise. The base rate is currently set at the second best rate as of the last project evaluation, and it does not yet include everything the group have been working on. With this in mind, they have decided to set most things, and concentrate on studying only a few key aspects, the neural network, the voice activity detector, and the noise estimation. "
Bro026,"ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley met mainly to discuss work on their main project, the Aurora task, but also talked about the work of one of their student members. Some members of the group met recently with research partners to settle on the current state of their software, and decide on the future work they would investigate, and these decisions were relayed to the rest of the group. Of the three areas for the future, they touched mostly upon the use of a second, parallel, data stream. The group also discussed a new part to the evaluation, the use of a chunk of the Wall Street Journal. Speaker me006 is working on data clustering, and discussion of related issues led to more general acoustic matters. "
Bro027,"ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley meets to discuss, for the most part, progress on the Aurora Project. The main areas being worked on were the voice activity detector and the tandem data streams. The group discussed possible further investigations that arose from these areas, including better linking the two. They also consider how aspects of an absent member's work might be applied to the current project. The meeting closed with a discussion of upcoming absences, and how meetings would continue. "
