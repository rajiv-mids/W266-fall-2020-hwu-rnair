d fifteen ? seventeen . that's expensive . think i'll be able to pull it up , or i could put it in the shared folder really ?    production cost's at twelve fifty , half of the selling price is taken up by building it . and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is yi yes , presume  no ,   yes , yes , i don't think we have to i don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that .  what are your experiences with remote controls ? i've got we got we had three videos , a t_v_ and a amp thing all set up we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals we'd have to re programme it every now it was quite a cheapie as that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .   the main that's the main anyway , and you don't want to i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button like that .   when they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up to the other functions where you can do sound or options recording , things like that inside it . it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , what about the older generation ?

in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .  that's a cost thing , i don't know how much we're gonna know about yes , no that's important .    right , we've got half an hour before the next meeting , we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation .    i would it would probably . there's sky remote controls and everything . they're moulded and look a bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , ","i'm sarah , the project manager this is our agenda , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . we want it to be original , trendy , appealing to a wide market , and user friendly , grannies to kids , even pooches should be able to use it . first is the functional design , this is where we all go off and do our individual work , what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , what effects the product has to have conceptual design , and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , and sum up the characteristics of that animal . i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . finance wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five euros , which i don't actually that is in pounds , that's expensive . i'll be able to pull it up , or i could put it in the shared folder production cost's at twelve fifty , and profit aim is fifty million euros , what are your experiences with remote controls ?

ES2004b.A,"       it can be that's with me . further .   why's it not working ? f_ eight , right ?  why's it in the right ? it's connecting .  actually some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we'll take a feedback from the marketing because i haven't had some marketing data and every product is marketable . purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v_ to make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i would say it's it should be user friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering having hundred buttons and having remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to make it unique that people want to buy it , will this two features together . what the concept is to have a flip top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip top . it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used thirty to forty percent of the buttons it's not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we have to make a profit also we can go for an economies of a higher production by fifty million we said ?  with that we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . that's this is if you ask me personally , i would make flip top with a trendy design and s we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . in overall a simple and user friendly design . any comments like , if you want ?  you'll have to you can't it'll have to this can't be pulled . you'll have to push it a bit more .  this is more than enough .   you can pull it out now .    that's fine .   anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? ten perc   pens   are we talking of a single model or five , six designs ?  alright . right . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .     to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , touch screen could be a better option for that . a bigger b you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . for u_s_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and in japan and all you need to have a small ,  we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?     right . it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . simple .   are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?  right .   what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , they came up with something like this , curled up , here , and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , it's like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat . g what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . it's already curled up your thumb doesn't y we can have a s like moulded according to your the way you h hold of it's semi circular in the bottom , something like that . i wouldn't say exactly semi circular but smooth . current .  we could look in at that but what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . a sea shell ? we could look in at that . we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs .    for detection , right .   true .  we should f it's time for us to get back to ","actually some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we'll take a feedback from the marketing and to summarise i would say it's it should be user friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering having hundred buttons and having remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . what the concept is to have a flip top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip top . and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used thirty to forty percent of the buttons we can go for an economies of a higher production we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . if you ask me personally , i would make flip top with a trendy design and s we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . are we talking of a single model or five , six designs ?

 i'll go over what we decided last meeting ,  we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed a flip open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that .  three presentations , i've got written here shall we hear from marketing first ?

it just said , for t_v_ only . but general t_v_ controls do video as you bu som you get com you get combined t_v_ and videos don't you ?  we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming .     bu we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , on the t_v_ you could put like a pack on the t_v_ you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v_ and it beeps and you're like it's over there , something like that , but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . people paying more for it to look good . we need to focus on that as     what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers  you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not about the you don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . think that might appeal i'm thinking japan , i'm thinking young , office people , trendy thing . but quite , easily labelled that anyone can that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to the older generations , were too big .  we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , it's gonna be the same , we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , or a speech recognition , which is extremely expensive , that's the only way that you avoid that issue . we are we're talking about the type of company that we're working for as that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but i don't think we're focusing on that , we are focusing on a mid range business class type people .  the remote control functions . we've got the t_v_ , we've got the video , now there's can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it , because you've got your general record anyway if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , ","this is our second meeting right our agenda for today , i'll go over what we decided last meeting , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . we discussed a flip open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . three presentations , i've got written here shall we hear from marketing first ?

ES2004b.C,"   i'll go first . can i grab the  what do i have to press ? f_ eight ? right ,   there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? a device which just sends the signal to the t_v_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that it wasn't really my area because i'm dealing with the inside really . ran out of time couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . and found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i'm not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky d i didn't know if you wanted to look at something else we could shrink down the size of the control .  no , if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .  the you can get the circular round ones but i'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with were the power source for the batteries otherwise it's not gonna work , as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who's watching the t_v_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer . and this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it's not a proper circuit , i'm not if it'd work or not , i'm not even confident that those are the real the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i_ interface which would when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the t_v_ receiver , which means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost all the components that i've put forward are low in cost that should be good . it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , because they're small they're also easy to lose if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , i th that was just general point there . and that's alright and that's what i came up with there , if you wanna  function f_ eight no , no it's just .     there we go , i've got a bit more of the cable . there we go . you should be able to and there you go .    t i d dunno the w if you've g if and if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v_ anyway on to like the t_v_ hard drive or   ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway . alright , alright ,  but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let where it is thought that could be quite a      you could have a number of different designs inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . just   that's what i was just no , no you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just    but also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics there's physically different things if you've ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big ","this is the working design , what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ?

ES2004b.C,"because they're c just generally japanese people have smaller hands they couldn't get round the controller which is if you i don't you you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .          i was just thinking about how you could combat that without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes  speech recognition , but   ge  video plus .  just whack in the number . and you w  and you wouldn't need whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,   it's not  it's been around for a long time it's just it's not very advertised as to how to use it and things .  though if y if you've got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . that but just to have that function would be really good .   but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract they the companies who who you deal with have actually they've got an obligation to help you out and also it's fair enough to have some help service but i'm not how much the cost would be of having    instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that .  department ,  and they're they should be f   it's the  they're specially made for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , you could bundle a charger in with it but      and if if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could on that as  some docking station or  th that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .

 right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? see .     that's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . no . the plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? no . meter adjusting .   have i got to keep this here ? does it matter ? i'll have t i'll have to move it won't i ? whoops . will it manage ? bit more , dear .  is that  just pull it closer a little bit . get it right over ,   i'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . that's where we started , we used our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i've just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , it has obvious design implications there . we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that's quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping . again there's power implications there . fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , again a big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they've lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we didn't put to them , but which i'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . that trend reverses in the older age groups . thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they're not bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , but i'll just keep it simple , if there's any more information email you extra details , is that  can we not programme a video with this remote control ? just channel hopping . would that imply video use ? yes . yes . we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons , th those do tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video , fast forwarding , on and it's general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare  i've just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , we didn't differentiate . would you prefer an l_c_d_ screen , that's multi function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , that's just general fear of new technology .  right .  yes . that's a super idea .  yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , you get the idea . it's gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .

  we c solar would be slightly expensives . it's twelve point f another question is like  w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control we have to s look at the life also .     second thing is and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . is that feature available in like titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or   something like alright . that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also . didn't get the last part , you're talking of just what you said i didn't get the meaning of it completely , you're saying like     f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , we can divide the circuit like     would like to share something which i did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there's too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i i found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m g_ g_u_i_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip top and g graphic user interface which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is like you have on a l icons you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . we are having a combination of boards , on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .  but   and to the and the lower distance . perfect . the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like i if you see the previous slide most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . this is central one , the one you volume and channel . keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it's here . this and voice recognition . the kinetic .  ","it like it runs for long time ? w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day . and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there's too much of confusion here . we are going to have m g_ g_u_i_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip top which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , we would not change h that particular pattern the kinetic .

ES2004c.B,"i'll until you're all hooked up .   put it on in that way .   welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . right this is our conceptual design meeting ,  we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , i th this is where we talk about properties , materials , user interface and trend watching . think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it .  the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .  we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . shall we start with the first presentation ? yes if you feel  it's  very much . let's start from the inside and work our way out . i don't think not yet . yes , i hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .     wa can you explain that ? like a right , how what how l long can you get out of that , can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? or that doesn't count though does it ? it was u_v_ like any , any i'm pretty that solar is from the sun . i don't think it counts electric lights no , but not many you don't want to limit your market . people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . but then it would be charging through the day , that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .  i've seen but then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time if you'd you switch the t_v_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . is it really gonna be enough ?  it's not the draw on it isn't  like a dual expensive as what price are we looking at for i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? solar . they're not designed practical wise you do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as  can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's add it in to think about because , where am i ? if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do we're doing something original and different but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you wouldn't lose it much . but then that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls . no .  right .  what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of        hinged , instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .   that's been really popular with mobile phones don't see why not .    it would be flat inside .  it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,  like one of the palm pop thing . it would have to be attached . we'll talk about that if you finish your and we'll come back to that . that's you , right no . we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . it's a remote control , you were sitting watching t_v_ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t_  no , no .       which means    can we swap that round th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .  that's what i was just saying , and then have the l_c_d_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , have the the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side .  i can't see that , is that play and stop and things ? or is that volume and channel ?  right . i'm not how long we've got left , ","right this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves this is where we talk about properties , materials , user interface and trend watching . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , i'm pretty that solar is from the sun . if we're doing the kinetic thing instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , that's been really popular with mobile phones don't see why not . it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . you were sitting watching t_v_ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t_ can we swap that round th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?

ES2004c.B,"but we need to make a decision about the things we've discussed . we agree on do we agree on the battery ?  that means that there's no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a selling point . the only the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . the l_c_d_'s not cheap .  and you could   do you want like a back up ? we've got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? there's not a really a decision to be made there , the buttons what did you give us as our the bare board l_c_d_ or on the top one you've got the touch  and then  no , it's fine . for the inside .  think no  we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m yes . we could just pick anything . it's just different it's just different from everything else and i'm trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're interesting and  and you would just have an across the b you would have many different options that you could do , you could have plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little  and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you could just go far with it , like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , think that's quite a flexible thing . yes .   we've got five minutes , or that might've been up for a while .  have you  they do , but we can you could it is , it is , you just address that with advertising . you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . that it's got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that i'm not worried about that . depending on how i we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . but we'll find out more about cost afterwards . right i'm going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo   think we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes think we've probably got about that time before we come back . it's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took . is everyone happy ?

ES2004c.C," i was getting that impression as etcetera .     that screwed in ?    this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . first the into the method . the main idea of the whole thing is just you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i've looked into the availability of some of the materials , some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . findings , i've got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what's used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it's used for all t_v_ remotes at the moment . and then we're loo looking into battery options . there's actually no rechargeable option available , we i saw the the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest , people won't it's like wind up radio . you wind up your remote control before you use it . it might you presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but i don't think it's really necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway they could get when you got t_v_ . no . is it ? alright i it would the d the dynamo would take more space you actually need a physical handle to wind up .  but  and most people also watch t_v_ in the night anyway . but the next one's the best anyway . the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it . the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up , i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .  it's it charges into some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size watch battery , they use them quite frequently in watches . and that'll that would l would last for do i d i'm not entirely how long it would last but i've never seen one run out .   and but then again it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . and th for the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no i do i don't think the draw on it would be  ye th y you could have a dual power thing but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they're qui they're quite big and they all look i identical . they're expensive , they don't the normal batteries would be the cheapest i'd presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it's they're not very resistant to dropping , if you drop  if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and y practically . calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , they can t they do , they they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller  w m the  the s if you if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , i don't think you'd the it would d how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . think it would ,        i'll move on . my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b_ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this l_e_d_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .  this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that that it's simply spaced like that you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you see how thin the tracks are , you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to but the there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i'll speak about in the next bit that and then to to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a t_v_ remote , ","this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . some of the things that we looked at last

ES2004c.C,"but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . the case material , i've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing and the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year , perhaps some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've said that they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . i'm no i'm not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . the problem with the casing is that there's quite there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone .  th  in titanium i don't think it would be available really , the ju just it w you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it's light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .  rubber , and you can peel them off    t  also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the i kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i'm you could probably get it in different colours and just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but that an l_c_d_ type of screen one they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in a array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and you could have them like a touch display . what on the l_c_d_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it's flat and you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you wouldn't have with the l_c_d_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the l_c_d_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the  you could have a flat screen inside , but i'm just wondering whether we want an l_c_d_ screen inside . it wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there'd be touch buttons , you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti r_s_i_ . is rubber .  hadn't really thought of that to be honest . you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out but they could get a bit easily lost , had      that's that's the end of m my   that would be fairly simple , you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .     you can you could do it , you could have a if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d_ display it'll completely blank it out , but i don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i'm not about     if you if if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d_ screen .   but you can do it with your thumb li     we    think if it is qui it's quite a feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re manufacture them . do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , i'm here thing ? that would be quite fun .   to s th it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour if we've just got a black and white one , they use them in calculators   you cou k no the kinetic ones come with watch a battery that goes in a watch . it's a lot smaller , it would  the think were we're going for the l_c_d_ on that one , on the buttons , on the on the top one we're gonna  on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti r_s_i_ ones . on we've got the flip screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . plastic ,   no .   you can just    j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .   the whistle ones ,  depending on the expense of it . and they've got in stock ,    did it ?

ES2004c.D,"good grief .     shall i ?  we just connect up .  there we go .  we decided on our market and this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most im i'm i'm slightly tongue tied after lunch , project manager . we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at .  now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that . unless anyone has any questions about that ? not yet ?   i know .   does light charge as sunlight does ? artificial light ? has to be solar .  artificial light , no . that's going to i know , different parts of the world too , if we're marketing internationally .    could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? could people put standard batteries in but with a s they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ?  that affects the exterior design .  again it de  it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature , i it's not gonna add anything , shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i personally right , it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research , it's not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field but it's something to put on the side to think about     it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone . like a rubber sleeve almost ,   very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .   i don't s to interrupt , i don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that it'd be f . have i misunderstood you ?    had another idea , i don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .   they're easy to replace as cheap .   just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? a pencil or a pen , they wouldn't really need a  i'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , i'm not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing . they don't look at themselves ? just a thought .  i it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but we'll leave that one on the side .   think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought what does that stand for ?  ","and this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . there also seems to be trend towards a spongy feel to materials , referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research , but it's something to put on the side to think about i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , i don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing . ","The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching, including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion. The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available. He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials. "

that seem sensible ? and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . alright tool training .  project plan . does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? neither am i . see , we shouldn't really be right we have the project team , which is to to come up with a new r remote control device . we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time . and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get a bigger market share and bigger audience .  method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design  in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device . and having meetings that we can during the course of the day come up with a better inst implement than we had before . and therefore have a successful conclusion to the day . and you'll be doing various designs throughout the day to meet this end . we've got tool training . try out whiteboard . we will right everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . this is make the whiteboard works . don't know who wishes to go first . do you wish to go f have a first bash at whatever .  but now you you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . i take it that i would guess or technical problems . you designers are meant to come up with these things .    next . i don't see as there's any need to . there's plenty of space . whatever . exactly . we've had more time to prepare over this side , we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . the three pens are underneath . you get marks for artistic impression . you're just doing the face .    right , i've not actually had too many pets over my time to be honest with you i'm not too keen on them anyway . not to worry . what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got few fish and hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw .  as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as anyway and one of the best things about fish is that they don't really take too much looking after because with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a dripper feed which feeds them over the couple of weeks that you're away and change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , other than the fact that they keep dying , fish are are not are reasonable pets in that they're low maintenance . right .  if we're still all with us . right work has been done on this project where by twenty five euros is the expected selling price . that information has come from our marketing manager here . we're looking to sell internationally , not just in europe . we're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half euro per unit . and therefore making a profit margin of not actually a profit margin it's because you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from that to give you your profit margin per unit . and depending what the the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .  experience with remote control , first ideas . new remote . guess we're looking at having a discussion at this point in time to help you folks design our new model as it were . any thoughts ? we're looking for some we're looking for a device that is robust and therefore won't get damaged too easily . we're looking for a device that is what was the other things you said there ? easy to use . use . and see .    w i'll get back to you on that . but it seems to me sensible , as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room . and device for all remotes .  but is it in a sense it's r mutually exclusive . you can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to you want simplicity as you want any idiot to be able to use it . whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . and these are probably mutually exclusive options that  you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . better instructions .   we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . we have to start winding up . is there next meeting in thirty minutes .  right , we've got i_d_ the come on , where's my  there we go .  that's what i was looking for . right . we've got function what happened to the right . right . about that .

ES2014b.B,"we have a we have a presentation each , i've got one .   we didn't , no . i d i didn't personally . that's fine . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one .  i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . alt function f_ eight . again not doing anything .  pressed about five times now . that's me . have to go again . hopefully that should be it this time . we're there . that's good .  i'm gonna be looking at the working design . of the remote control . i've just got three sections , first is the research i made on the remote control itself and then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual remote . having researched the existing models within the market , found my research off the internet . i've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . the basic components are an energy source which in most existing models would be a battery supply . whether that'll be two batteries , four batteries , it may vary . we then have the user interface , which is the like the buttons on the actual remote . the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that . there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . and then the sender , which is usually , i've found , an infra red device which sends a signal to the actual television . and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's found in the television .  i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working , i'll just go through there . s do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? i'll j see .  i'll get rid of the bear that's great . we start off with a battery suppl no , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery .  we then have a particular button , which may be that's there's lots and lots of different buttons . but this is how the basic system works . that sends after you press that sends the message to the chip , which then sends it interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender .  that's . that's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . this is the user interface . this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the infra red sender . and then on the separate thing we have on the television we have a receiver . and the sender sends a message to the receiver .  yes , that's the power source .  going on to personal preferences , i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . you don't want a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not really a remote . and then the sender , and infra red has been used quite successfully . if the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly you don't have to be point directly at the television itself .  yes . and that's it for the moment .  would you be able to get rid of the extra buttons here , the circular section , because that seems to be for a video as we could dispense with that little bit as and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . possibly ? j just this little bit is that that's still video remote part , we could get rid of that as it's just people are used to seeing that , if we didn't have them then they might think it's       i suppose with nine you've got the like the last one which makes the tenth means you it's like multiples you can put them together you can make any number . with that we'd by pass any problems with   that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .  we could get it down to what ? we get to how many buttons have we got ? we've just got ten , eleven twelve th we got fourteen that we need . which isn't really too many . that'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .    yes , that seems good . if you just give it a second to catch up . i'm we'll have by the end of today .   no what i think is it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for the speech recognition . and possibly the thing about the remote being lost we could have with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . we can have some sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some buzzer system between the two . you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . that is true , yes .  guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the remote .  if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one device .  you could have an option to turn it off . or perhaps , ","i'm gonna be looking at the working design . i've just got three sections , first is the research i made on the remote control itself and then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual remote . having researched the existing models within the market , found my research off the internet . i've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do the basic components are an energy source which in most existing models would be a battery supply . we then have the user interface , which is the like the buttons on the actual remote . the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that . there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . and then the sender , which is usually , i've found , an infra red device which sends a signal to the actual television . and the last part is receiver which is important in the system because that's found in the television . i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery .  we then have a particular button , that's there's lots and lots of different buttons . after you press that sends the message to the chip , and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . that's the components of the remote this is the user interface . which then , and that's the infra red sender . and then on the separate thing we have on the television we have a receiver . going on to personal preferences , i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . and then the sender , and infra red has been used quite successfully . would you be able to get rid of the extra buttons here , the circular section , because that seems to be for a video as we could dispense with that little bit as and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . how many buttons have we got ? we've just got ten , eleven twelve th and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for the speech recognition . and possibly the thing about the remote being lost we could have with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . we can have some sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some buzzer system between the two . you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . or like the same technology could be put inside the remote . you could have an option to turn it off . or ",The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device. He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together. He gave his preferences on energy sources and senders. The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels. He suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements. The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function.

ES2014b.D," i've got one too .    there's usually a little thing in the top right for the hang on , it's just coming on .             i'm not i had i've had some market information , but not from the company , no .    i'm gonna pull this off .     i'll give it another go . there we go . right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . and first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the t_v_ and how do people use it ? we asked them which buttons were useful for them . how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would they like to remote control . and we did that by giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a even higher proportion would spend more for a fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the setting buttons for the picture and brightness and the audio settings , they weren't used very often people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control . and young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people weren't quite keen on speech recognition . there's a lot more th there's a lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . and the second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it .  my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sleek good looking high tech a design which looks high tech , and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should concentrate on the channels and power , and also volume and that thing , as louisa said . we could come up with a menu , a an l_c_d_ menu for other functions on the remote control . that's worth thinking about . and we could think about speech recognition as because young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy our new product if we aim it at high tech design . that might be the market that we're looking for . and we could think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than having it to speech recognition to change the channels . there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .  and that's the end of the slide show . that's it .  about speech recognition ?  youn young people pref  they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in remote control that you could talk to ,      we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as which again would probably be a bit expensive , but          would it take quite a while to develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? considering         about five minutes .        do we need to decide on the functions now ? s   and and that was the number one frustration that people said , i don't think there's anything else on the market that does that ,   no not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? no , clapping , clapping ,    taking out teletext ,  nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a second or two to press another number , you can press any two and it'll put them together .    we could possibly put an l_ a l_c_d_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that      i s i suppose if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote all most tellies come with remotes , we're talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , we need to keep the tuning function in .  that would be a good idea ,    i'm not whether the having people have a booklet one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . next to each of the buttons , each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , you're pressing right .        th the the detailed ones would be brightness , sorta    and probably a power one as dunno .       the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick ,  numbers is ten , volume is twelve , th si one up , one down . and a mute , that's sixteen isn't it , i don't think no . you've got brightness and contrast .    and then an enter button for saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it ,     right .

have there been any changes ? right . three presentation ,  fine .    what would be the cost do we know ?    with the printed circuit boards you were going for the  but are we going f r right . are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , would it not be best to rather than one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time . at that point then you've got the details up there , if we wanted to know that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . does that make sense ?   no the scroll wheel required the regular , the    the display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .  down . right . we're going for p is simple push button .  if we go for the simple push button , effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? or are we going for the regular ?  but is there any other that's true for the for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . and if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . s right .  no .      simple circuit board . simple push button .  w kinetic . you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .  and how does it get charged up ?   the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition ? no ? that required the advanced i had speech recognition requires advanced req require   speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . and we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . would that be it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ? and then have to change all change everything at the last minute . s   i've found that try and get it back . you were saying the scroll buttons  we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that wouldn't necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications . you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in like a you'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub divide your market up . but that's really where your field is .  anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . is that what are we deciding to do here ? right .  the fi  the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .   you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . and you were talking  and you were talking about scroll buttons ?

ES2014c.A,"if y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . that means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , that's not a good idea i would suggest .  but if   was that in the fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that fashion ? it was , wasn't it ? the  rubber buttons require rubber case .  the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to mint them out if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . you're just changing one aspect like the standby button like that , and especially then you could make it something that you might be limited in space , that yes . you two are gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how pliable is plasticine .   you're talking there about changing the casing .  you could do a colour change , therefore you would  that's effectively what they did with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? but yes that's true that might no not necessarily , because you could have your company we're meant to be finishing up . you could have your company badge and logo . lot of computers like on the one you've got there , it actually has a stick on badge what you would al all you would really need , whether it , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it that in a sense , with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out on would be a white casing . you're you're badging it . and lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top . and the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the the windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from white casing product .   it's in the house , isn't it , i suppose . don't change case . change case colour . and we're saying no to that .  sounds reasonable .  if you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases that you could or otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .   one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a packaging box that does that . and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis a vis the total cost of the product . but no .  right . s do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? we're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or  curved or double curved ? it's single curved .  yes . we've got spongy feel buttons as have we ? as as or w or was that it's rubber buttons , it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . with a rubber case right ? and the standby button is gonna be different . what shape are we making the standby button ? a apple .    a red apple ? is it ?  what was that last thing again there ? right much option on that . you were going for a single curve and alright . right , shape of buttons simple .  that's that , we should now go away and get these things sorted out . you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .

ES2014c.B,"we all have a presentation again , if we go through those and then  shall i go first again ? i see this a little more smoothly than the last one .  right , let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . then there is a chip and still the sender . yes including the power s supply as i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery ,  there's a dynamo . any of you think of like the old torches which you wind up  there's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . that's one option , but that was gonna cost a little more . and then there's solar cells . as a final option . for the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is just to say all these are supplied by real reaction . guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which is just the same as the standard ones . this says it's similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like like modern computer . there's a scroll wheel which is the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . you could do that . one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , we have to take that into consideration . moving on to the printed s that's on the next i th the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . which is the next section . for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the workings of the actual of the remote . the firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board . and there's different prices according to each . if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there's a small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . and that would require a more advanced circuit board , there is an extra price in that sense . there is th an extra cost in that sense . going to my personal preferences , thought possibly for power we could use kinetic which is the idea of the watches that you move you move the remote around to power it up . and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . for the buttons , we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we'd have to get a more costly circuit board . and that's it . it depends if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . i'm guessing . but i don't know , that is something i'll have to look into . that's a decision for all of us .  we decide .   yes . is there  we could do , we should . as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information .  if you down it's just this bit at the bottom which i've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range . also the display's for something else which we decided against . but that bit and note that the push button just requires a simple chip , that would keep the price down .  just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? the it was what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message and replies to you . it is the concept we discussed before . but then we don't know for whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . i'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information . we should go on what we're certain of rather than if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . that would be something separate ,  we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . that makes sense .  that makes sense , we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra possibility .   just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .

ES2014c.B,"it's think it works on the basis they have some ball bearings inside . it's it's some on watches which you you shake to power it up . somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it . think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected it was just no th that's what but it doesn't . might have got that wrong . it's just an addition thing it's   shall i pass on to you now ? i assume it would cost extra , but we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . if you right click and then go onto a previous slide . right .  on the price ,  we're going for the biggest market , not , but was it specified that we went for the biggest ? the children's remote should be like a next step , but for ours , we should  you also said for going for the international market that some older people might not like the speech recognition . s  it w it would make it quite complicated , where ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the    yes . we could have like   we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the buttons themselves . possible .     we got it down to not too many .  are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t we should see yours first .       dunno fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,  it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . to something which is more universal . we c can imply a fruit shape possibly . the spongy feel is something we could think about , still with a rubber design we could   one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case . no  it's if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . that's the way round . if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . which makes sense .   i suppose we are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not .  yes . we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated .  the a the actual the the look from the outside , where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the way it looked . that's true .  it is a possibility , yes that is    and whether we'd have a big enough market to have this like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .  suppose , where you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . less likely to then th that would  it seems to make sense that we'd just stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as   mayb curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine .    shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to   shall we quickly we'll go for single curve , single curve . did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? the one you move around ?    we ca  we'll still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? i th we can by not having anything too complicated .  and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out .  it was just   we will go for the a apples .  and then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? just like the just working out what we're gonna do for the next time .    and j just keeping the the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as fairly self explanatory .  is that the end ?

ES2014c.C,"   that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . have a lot of the information there . it might not be very clear . unless you want to plug it back in to yours . the scroll wheel and if we're going for sleek and sexy , scroll wheel is bit kinda bulky ? i've got pictures i've seen pictures with it sticking off the side of it , and they don't really look great . a simple pushbuttons .  but but the way that i interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . don't think it would effect our circuit board .  and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning jo . it might be useful to say like where are you remote . here i am , jo . but that's as far as that one could go ?  just as a fun way to find it . and it says that it said the cost of that isn't too much . think it would be helpful to find it , but i don't think it'd    i'll just check what it said . actually i don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , like it's already   that was quick . very brief presentation , from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy . haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there's some curved cases that you can see , range of sizes all of them have a lot of buttons there they seem to just have the rubber buttons . does that move it ? it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . it's alright . there wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . some of the remotes that i looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions . and it was quite swish model , where it can control four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d_ , audio . that's a bit of competition there .  it's better not to try and compete with that thing and just to market it as a completely different like different viewpoint as a finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions . the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . and there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great .   th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , there was children's remote , where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you could program them that they could only look at certain channels . but i don't know if that's really in our field ? but that's something that's out there .     right that's something that we can be aware of .  because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function .   different languages might not be compatible .  think you program this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .   unless something else comes up .  think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .  and just to be aware that there are specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote .  there was a mention just as warning about button design . just to avoid ambiguity . it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a v_ on for volume , let's think how they did this . i'm just gonna check do this right . what did they say ? think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see actually that can't be right , can it ? no , they might see they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , the function is to turn the button up . be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be two contradicting shapes .  and that's all i had to say for that . what was the decision on the design of the volume button ?       if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .  just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . that could be a little apple . and then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it wouldn't confuse the numbers . s but i suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , even if the design changes , it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as as buttons . and that you can make them curved or double curved and that would be the sleek and sexy look .

ES2014d.C,"we've made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .  y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on .   it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at a you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . and cherries are fun , summery . that's the mute . it'd probably have to be labelled mute . but we didn't have anything small enough to write .  we just chose simple shapes for all them . the important ones are the volume ones . we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .   and we chose a v_ plus and v_ minus . the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white play doh . that's where the colour buttons came from .   that's it . if you just minimise that one in the top right hand corner of the little box .   s d wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , you need both of them ? the voice recognition . but i do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .  i'd give it a two . one's true . and a four is neutral .  we haven't got the double curve , we can't like say it's completely true . but it's pretty close . we've got almost everything we can .  i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . three . i would give it more than a four . how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . and then it stand the test of time better .  i suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it .   two or three . i'd be happy with a two .    i would say as  it's got the cherry and the sponginess . two ?  that's a bit rough at the minute .  it's got the same speech feature as the coffee machine . two or three . the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . but the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do . two ? aye . go for it .  what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ?  we'll probably have to re rate it . it's on .  that'd be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .  we should just imagine white buttons .   the volume ones should stand out a bit .  real reactions ?   i don't see how we could make it any more . apart from doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .  but then what colour would you make the r_s ? no ,  we got the logo off the web browser .    i don't think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as   shouldn't we lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? we've lost the overall spongy feel . it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed alright . did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ? right . can check if that's a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ?  were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? right . do we have anything else to discuss ?    it could have been a slightly more creative project . remote control isn't the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing . i can't think of a better example at the minute .  it's a different application of it .   leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . but we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours .   very but i d i don't i'm not see the value in these . they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer right . you watch a video of it voice recognition thing .

They will be concerned with functional, conceptional, and detailed design. To try out the whiteboard, each group member draws her favorite animal on the board. They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls. They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors, materials, and shapes. They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal, whether it is a beep or light.

IS1009b.A,"is everybody ready ?   i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .    you're participant four . and now full screen .   can i at this point interject something ? we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate that's the teletext , because that's outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the t_v_ , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market .  and the and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , that it's easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . just wanted to interject this here we're not getting too much off track here with with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up we have to eliminate these things , it's only gonna be t_v_ , but the one thing that could be eliminated is the teletext idea .   and who would be next , that would be you .  you want me to get your slide show up ?  and you are number three ? number two .      there ,   yo and it's  but it's   that has been e that has been eliminated , that's unfortunately a moot point now .   it just build a mould and as the budget we're looking at if you build one mould i don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or yes .  we will have to look at the budget on that but in principle that would be fun ,  silly for children . like an animal or   a little elderly , a little arthritic hand and it's a small button and it they don't press it exactly something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated    yes . yes . you're sitting there already or you have no other     holder ,   you don't have to . this one ? and francine ? you are number two ? you're three . would you want it full screen ?     on the remote .    right .  yes . by your child ,         timer ,  now i have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how does it work . these are the two things we should come up wit with . the first thing is pro little easier on who is our target group .  in many ways everybody . everybody who has a t_v_ .  and today there are probably not many people who don't have a t_v_ . there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , think that's one group that's certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear . and don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . that's a question whether that's important that children can really use it or not . this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes different buttons for different groups .  that has a lot of appeal but i'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever  but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we afford to have i'm asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ? right . with  that's  no the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons within the target group or subgroups . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . the basic design i understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is everybody with a t_v_ . that's the question . there's there's an idea the new new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and something like that , ","i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . can i at this point interject something ?

The project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated, and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors. They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children, making the buttons various shapes, and putting a display clock on the control. They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases. The interface designer presents, talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a T-shape and add an alarm clock function. "
IS1009b.A,"that in each package you have you have you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .  yes .  and but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it think the idea here is to to d design one remote and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was tha that's the old message . finish meeting now . but to sum it up the target group is everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . do we agree , do we ? do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .  now i understand it's lunch break . and that's what we will do . hank you very much . and we'll see you after lunch .

","as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice . and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel that the ch children cannot view that channel . one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v_ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t_ in alphabet for more compactability . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that .

IS1009b.C,"  open . and then full screen .                 complicated ,        number two ,  exactly . can you make it full screen no , it's like a you have to press here . the cup shape here ? the thir third . exactly . today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide the metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v_ or a air conditioner , something like that remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel like that then the remote remote controller will send a se send a signal , and the t_v_ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control and think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices .    user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the t_v_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v_ can perform the actions . can you go to the next slide just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller think these are the very simple features and they don't take much much of the investment also , it's like el the text or buttons which which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they'll be like light emitting if it is dark that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this is not a action , there can be no action taking to that and there should be a child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but it's possible but it  it's and different shapes that we can do like we can have all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and that  and colours also , different colours , and no no , it won't don't think it will be like , you can have for if you want ther there to be more  it's just a s shape it doesn't matter .  that is also possible i that will be   for children , exactly . that's what , exactly . and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , think we need to make some buttons which are like in in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more   it's like     yes . you don't us usually . shapes also , different shapes . that will      and also text should be very clear that there won't be any ambiguities and  and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit it's and we display a clock .  and then you can just see your remote controller   can you go to the next slide components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . and bulbs . like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t_v_ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .

IS1009b.C,"then it will be like if you switch on your t_v_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller you can find with the light . we can have that . whenever the t_v_ is on , remote controller will have a light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , there should be wires . and there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .  holder . can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where i have got s few points . that's it , that's it from me now .  it's not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and if you want . it's it's actually there now , there on the screen .   if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .  it's like a t it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television . t_v_ , don't t_v_ ,          we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and  children and everybody , that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different no , it doesn't cost , doesn't doesn't matter .    no . i don't think no . it's not .  like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all that w we can have that .  but    if we do some more research , we .  seventy percent is a unique remote controller and thirty percent is it's like    ","and there should be a case where we can keep all the things if we do some more research , we .

IS1009b.D,"i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be right with you .   you want me to start right now ?  could you put my slides up think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time . i'm participant four i believe . yes  there we go . think we have introduced ourselves , the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide . that's where m my discussion starts . right since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it . thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d_ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . i'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those . that was what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee gotta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by september , anything that you don't already have out there in september showing it around , isn't gonna sell for christmas . and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of of the features and of the look and the colour and i'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . i'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , we gotta sell this sizzle . a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything . i'd like the suggestions to be really specific , that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what'll be and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or lamp . i have to wind up ?      that's something    alright , for that . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as as beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . can we go to the next slide my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there's no be back , in sales they always say be backs don't come back . if somebody says , i'll come back and get it next week you're dead . they're never gonna come back and buy it . ","thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . i'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . because if we're gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . it's gotta be really attractive and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or lamp . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , we talked about the a light emitting thing as as beep , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .

yes , nine numbers . and then you have swapping of button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one . next slide , then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television that the user can see the subtitles on the screen . then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be a memory switch . there should be a mute button . suddenly if viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the t_v_ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v_ . now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . it's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . the t_v_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . this is one of the interface which can be created . a very simple interface which has all the t important features . then , next slide . then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user friendly . even a kid can use that . can you go on t to the next slide . this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . and this has multi purpose use , it can be used for t_v_ , it can be used for cable satellite , it can be used for v_c_r_ , d_v_d_s and audio . and this has in built voice recogniser . can you go on to the next slide ? now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use . this is user friendly , it's very attractive and children can use it as as they can play with it . and this comes with different colours , different shapes . and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . next slide , now this is a big over sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . this .  this is no this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . this i this is one such interface which can be created . and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user's voice for a particular function .  that's yes .    we can . it works . yes .   transmit .   push buttons .   yes , i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . this could be one feature which could be sellable .  no , it's it's , it's like your recording of all question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th you have a t_v_ system , i'm the user and my family members are the user , i will already record question like , good morning , like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television . i'll say just good morning and the t_v_ will switch on . it will recognise my voice and will switch on . battery . yes . yes . and compact . trendy design and compact . yes . push buttons . and supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button . recogniser . yes . yes .

IS1009c.C,"hi . good .   going to the nex next .      participant two . the next one , it's it was the old one . components . this time i'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . can you go on to the next slide , i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it's like it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , that it can be strong , even if you just if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . it should be strong . and there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . and  and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , we have to use some colouring compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as as low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m it's like a battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . a battery i would like to suggest one thing if we if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . it it's not a high voltage battery . then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , in that way we can cut the cost , but w that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . and we have a circuit board in a remote controller . can you go to the next slide , and how it works , how the remote controller works .  when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got a signal by pressing a button . that's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will know which what action it has to do . then it will do the appropriate action . this is how the remote controller works . can you go to the next slide , i have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it's it this is a normal remote controller . and to the next slide , and where we had a few buttons and all . and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator  and di and a diode transistor . the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an di can y you can see the t_a_ double one eight three five labelled chip you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor . and also there are resistors ther there is a diode . can you

IS1009c.D,"hi .    that is it .       you don't know me . i could lose that in a minute .    looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . what i'm no suggestion's bad . but we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . i don't think that we can get the t shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it's just funny . don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .   have to come back to that later . no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .    good point .         yes .  yes .  that's interesting . on the scroll and the push button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?    we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost .    go right to my first my next slide . alright , my method is i'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . i s i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i'm out in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation i ask about it . and i would encourage you all to do the same . and my findings from this is that , small is beautiful . people like something that really fits in their hand . simple is beautiful . they don't want to have to squint at small print they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye catching is important . it's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . go ahead , i'm trying to finish fast for you . and our preference is , as far as i'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many great features , the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , that we gonna say are really great about our new product . and i've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with little cloth on them . those are things we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .    you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?  speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? that could that could be our star feature . that be really good , i agree with that . distance problem ?   battery , and we all on that . that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing .  bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong .   that  or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . her speech recognition feature would be a supplement . why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .     wherever they're hiding ?

IS1009d.A,"hi everyone again .  like before we have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages to the t_v_ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d to be integrated in this in this new remote .  should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .   but her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . and circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and she thinks this is a great feature to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that's really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .       what button ? menu ? menu th menu , one .    yes the buttons are all raised , right ? are raised , right . or have two hands to operate it , yes , and it sticks up that you really you don't have to g first go like here it's on and if you're left handed or right handed it doesn't matter . i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? will have symbols that the user really knows and doesn't have to first learn it  but anyway it would ha i it has to have some symbols , text that people kn  just wanted make of that right ,  right . now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .  colours .  cutest .   now having said that no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . now we're gonna talk about financing .  there is a production evaluation . is that you ? but that's after the financing . see ? fi see ?   we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that's battery , right ? now . we we use one . what ? t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . that's she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it doesn't work .   let's see . one , go away . kinetic source that's in the energy source that's all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that's what we're using ? one of those ? come on . one . regular chip on print . no . that's all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . double curved ? one of those ? case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ? wood , rubber ? but , yes but that's just for the case material , special colours though , we having that , right ? and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no .

IS1009d.D,"hello   and she was challenged on that point        good . you used to have all the buttons that's good , no , that's and friendly .             menu button .   of the screen . the next channel in the numeric pattern , or        what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , i really like that . you really did a good job on that , my little designers . and i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place . that's a really good thing . that's great .  the colour's very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute and these on both sides they're mute ? you can push either one ?  and this brings the menu up on the screen ? this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are  f right , very good . it looks looks like something sell . and now i'm supposed to   good point because we need the symbols we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . symbols on it . .    for the snail , we have the snail shell . he goes right back into his shell . we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail like that that would , that would really work .  voice recognition is our big selling point nobody else seems to have that in this price range .  think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance . we're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block . think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they're gonna be our two selling points . i'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't i ?  but in my instructions it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something . no ? that's me .    can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? or  it's double curved .  rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . the mm'   no , we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ?  yes .     i'll take my file down you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . why don't you move just to the next slide right away . right away . my method for m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio economic groups and see about any fine tuning that little things we haven't thought of . we can't accept every suggestion but we just need to get a few . and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . next slide now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i didn't want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy we've got that . the size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand that's and functionality i put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . they don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . they'll be our main selling points .  th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide the shape think is a one . that's really , really excellent shape . the size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how i feel . that it's that it's plenty small enough to sell but we're right the scale is one to seven . we're right in the middle as far as c other competitors . and our colour is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality think you did a really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else ","what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place . the colour's very attractive . voice recognition is our big selling point we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance . i'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't i ?

The project manager introduced the smart boards to the team and led the team members in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and described why they liked the animal. 
TS3003a.A,"because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . another thing is you have to be bit slow . if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up .  we choose form of current colour think grey is appropriate . then the line width . seven will be now you'll see my drawing capabilities . these are not very much , but see you have to do it real slow .    i was trying to draw a dolphin , but his nose has to be a little bit but it's close . what it's this is bit of the swordfish .  he hasn't got an eye . woah . now we've got another function . we've got the eraser . and then you can undo this easily . it's and i've got to write down a few of its characteristics . is they've got no text tool , no .  this is typically a undo action , pen . you have to hold it a bit upside down . that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . but i don't know , i'm just trying . this is not my work ,  you have to use  it's a it wants to draw a another animal ? i don't know . it lives for the fun .  it's my characteristic characteristic about the dolphin . it lives for the fun .  now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . go ahead . it's easier to draw the smaller line width , because this is going a lot better than did .  it's   it's a real dead sheep ,  for recognition , i see . you can also write your name somewhere . on just a    sweet . just a blank sheet .  no .   it's pretty skinny cat . is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?    that's pretty clear .  everybody knows how to work with the white board now ?  if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . it's pretty easy .  s haunted white board .  we've got the tool introduction . we move along to the project finance . as you can see , we for our remote control , a selling price is twenty five euros . our selling price . our profit aim is fifty million euros . that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , we have to work together to reach our aims . we can do it international , we have to focus on different users , different cultures , and different trends as but that's all in the later stadium . our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros , that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and like that . it won't work .  just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . and production cost maximal twelve and a half euros .  that's leads us to our little discussion . we've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion .  i'm gonna sit down , it's easier . i've got a message . five minutes .  that's good timing . you have to say the magic word . does it do anything ? you have to just clap it down ? back up again . no slide show . it's off . now you have to put it back o  you'll be  it's those laptops .  but does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ? no ? you ?    i've got one at home . and you can program eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . and it also operates on infra red , you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your t_v_ on the second floor . that's a pretty handy thing . but only the that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as it's that's good to remember .  that's  we've we want different functions and we can see if we can do something with the infra red . but i don't know if that will exceed the production costs . that that's something we have to find out , and other functions for a remote control ? we can make it shock proof .  waterproof .  these are our few things we can think of . will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder . that's a battery stays .   that's an idea as other ideas ? quick ideas .  any questions about this presentation ? kick off presentation . no ?  then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . finish meeting now .  and we can all work on our own projects .  then i'll meet you in about a half an hour , good luck .

TS3003b.A," everybody found his place again ? that's  this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we're going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system .  there's our ghost mouse again . that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this it's in wing c_ and e_ .  it should be over in a while , couple of days . but it's going to be cold anyway , don't think you're gonna need it . then our agenda . now first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you're going to have a presentation . all of you . and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include .  we've got forty minutes for all of it .  i suggest let's start with the first presentation . who wants to be first ?   just it's easier if you  you will tell your presentation as just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about .    anybody have any questions until now ? about functional requirements ?  that's clear . now to the second .    you can take your time . we've got plenty of time ,   there it is . one remote .        anybody has questions about the technical functions ?   touchscreen .  that's   we can first listen to your presentation ? and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design .  it's going to it's not too much .      now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . i'm the project manager i'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . that's , we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v_ . that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . it has to be simple . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be thing of the past . and it's a function we don't need in our remote control . internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . also on televisions it will be available as another one is the customer is forty plus . that's the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . this is bit pity for the marketing expert . because he was aiming on the younger persons . we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and we have to be very clear on this point as  i suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions .  we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product .  against the no teletext ?   it's it is standard remote . no we can we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . and if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it's the biggest share of the whole population now . no . but don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the device i've looked for although i didn't realise it .  let's try it .   it's a big success . very big success .  as simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext .  no we haven't voted yet ,  think teletext can be can be a function as but only if if it won't higher the cost , because i don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as but i don't think it will be a problem . or is teletext a    i suggest  is anybody really against teletext ? no ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . that's a good idea as especially for the subtitles . we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .  ","now we're going into the functional design . then our agenda . first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you're going to have a presentation . all of you . and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . i'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v_ . that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be thing of the past . another one is the customer is forty plus . that's the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . i suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . standard remote . we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it's the biggest share of the whole population now . but don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the device i've looked for although i didn't realise it . think teletext can be can be a function as but only if if it won't higher the cost , is anybody really against teletext ? that's a good idea as especially for the subtitles .

TS3003b.A,"teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . functionality should be few buttons , you said . that's very important we have a few buttons . to keep it simple . no .  but do you need but do you need the buttons for one to zero . we can we can use no , we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or  the numbers  they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it's too much we can reconsider it . but there won't be very much buttons . or there don't have to be a lot . the number of buttons ? it's very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with to operate only the t_v_ no .    we can    you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of f of less buttons . no . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ? it can be no .  because that's that's a good advantage point as if we have a fancy looking docking station or very that's a requirement . docking station .   that's a good point . you said they easily get lost as  we should implement the audio sign ,    audio signal should be possible as it's not too expensive . another point is the l_c_d_ screen . don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because  it will be too much as  based . just the l_c_d_ . just the normal screen . that's a good idea .  some extra info . feedback . that's a good idea as as the small screen . extra button info . that should be possible as let's see what did we say . more . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d_ . general functions  and default materials . that's a good idea as because elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . that doesn't really matter .  we nee let's specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , what do we want ? if we want with the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people .   that's the now you're talking about sixty to eighty  sixty .  and different cultures . are we  no . we've got five minutes left just now . small warning . should  in different languages ,  or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary it's better to put it on different markets with it all .  that's the target . then a few small things .  i will put the minutes in the project project document folder . what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend watching .  just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on . and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach .  i for this meeting . and we have a lunch break now .  that's a good thing .

TS3003c.A," good afternoon . this is our third meeting already . i hope you enjoyed your lunch . i did anyway . let's see . presentation three .  this is the second phase we're going to discuss today . it's the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . but first i'll show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we're going to make it . and then we're closing . we have about forty minutes . suggest let's get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? no ? everything fine ? that's then a little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? no ? these are just the things we thought of , if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and we can work it out . and we're going to target sixty to eighty year old customers .  now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , suggest let's get started with the presentations .  shall we keep the same line up as last time ?  good luck .   any questions about the trends ? mayb no ?  we go on to the next one .       that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .   these are the points we have to discuss . first we can talk about the energy source , since that's has a pretty big influence on production price , and image .  first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget ,     no .      elderly people just like to have everything in place . and i don't think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . docking station will help them give the remote a place . and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote . but it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can still use the voice recognition , but then for only the channels . that's safe . that's a good point . go ahead . no .    easier to use ? no , that's a good point .  i personally think the l_c_d_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it . because it's just some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . and the we have to discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost signifi significantly . and i don't think the i don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as  that brings us back to the energy . if we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use .  in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as   let me just choose for the battery . that brings us to the chip . just the advanced .  advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . which brings us a little bit back to marketing as if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . or both ? as we saw there is not  wood is a lot more expensive to produce . but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . look i've got a new remote control , and  but with colour was a lot more expensive ? or ? you don't know ?  because  it's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape .  change the cases . you can sell the cases .  that's a very good option . because then you can advertise as with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point .  and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as costs .   you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , remote .    everybody's with the changing covers ? that's a good good option . changing case covers .   but the form has to be it has to it's has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ? and the cover of the docking station is also on top of the television then ? or not ? and you can just then click it in . that's  the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? you can make a little drawing of it on the on the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or   usabili ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it's  but you have extra buttons . people can get confused . ","it's the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend watching . but first i'll show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . then a little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . and we're going to target sixty to eighty year old customers . suggest let's get started with the presentations . that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . first we can talk about the energy source , first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , elderly people just like to have everything in place . and i don't think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . docking station will help them give the remote a place . and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote . but it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can still use the voice recognition , but then for only the channels . i personally think the l_c_d_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it . because it's just some extra information , we have to discard the voice recognition . if we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as let me just choose for the battery . that brings us to the chip . and then we get to the point of the case . if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . or both ? wood is a lot more expensive to produce . but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , but with colour was a lot more expensive ? or ? it's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape . you can sell the cases . that's a very good option . and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as costs . everybody's with the changing covers ? that's a good good option . it's has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ? the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ?

TS3003c.D,"good afternoon .   i'll start off then . doh .  i'm gonna inform you about the trend watching i've done over the past few days . we've done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and besides that deployed some trend watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends . and i've consulted some additional trend watch trend watchers , after the original trend watchers return , about what the best design would be .  these are some overall findings . most important thing is the fancy design . the research indicated that was by far the most important factor . innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . for our group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is these factors are slightly more equal .  these are some more group specific findings . the older people prefer dark colours . they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people . this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that the remote should have . this leads us to some personal preferences . the remote control and the docking station should blend in the room . this would mean no eye catching designs . just keep it simple and  the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control . this would be very important that we at least include these features . the trend watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone shaped . you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is new shape to older people . they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . it would be kinda more telephone shaped . besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood like colour and feel , and one with a grey black colour . the wood like for the more exclusive people . people with more money . the grey black colour for people with less means . that would be all . any questions ?   and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? you just you use it and it works .   personally i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product . wel  you could load up the batteries , you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there . that's true . i'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? in our earlier market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard .  it was open here . we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .  you can see here , our target group would not do that . if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .  this is  but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . and on top of that the l_c_d_ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . and voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .  this was for like an l_c_d_ screen like you would have on a on the most advanced mobile phones . pretty large .     and most important factor there is the wooden colour . it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just wood coloured . probably .  that is true .  we would have to look carefully into the design though . we would have to make one w control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . that would  i wouldn't design a telephone but  no we should just , we should then just design one one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .  but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved . could you explain that a little more ?  and what would single curved and double curved mean ?   we can just do whatever we want .  that's good . no just to lie down . we'll go for that .  or besides it .   you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , you could , your thumb would be easily  that was a very good point pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes r_s_i_ . that would be great for that . thought we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . for left handed users also . for the volume .  that could  we could do that but i'm not if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .

Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information. One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros. All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype.

The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups. He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45, improve the most-used functions, and make a placeholder for the remote. The interface specialist presents, talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality. The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen, LCD, and other functions. The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch. "
TS3007b.B,"hi . true .       yes , go ahead . last presentation .    i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , if you going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make , but also the user friendliness , tha that's some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , use as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons to be shown at the same time , when you visit an internet site you don't want fifty links to see , but use a hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was use touch screen , but s i don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote cannot receive anything , but we might consider that .  hope this is all clear to you . if you you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you're looking for teletext you'll be searching for half an hour from  where is it ? where the hell he here and , when you have to use something else . just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use a play and back and stop , that's very important .  this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it's no longer applying .  i prefer to use it only for t_v_ and not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select  and that's where the difficulties lie .  this that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . do we want to use a few options and might not be or original , or multi purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons .  weighing those factors .  the doesn't .   but when all the questions i had do we want to use menu display on the t_v_ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v_ , you can simply push more menu and then select the options you want to have and press  that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v_ and don't use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users . that will be a problem . yes .  if we have to stick with current technologies and the restrictions of what's is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . use big clear buttons . not too many . we'll loose a few option options , but this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind little little thing or a touch screen . and if you want to put on stand by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something .  as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple .  we should just ease down on the functionality to to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you'll never know and never use , and therefore it's important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the most important functions . that's an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues put a logo on it and use it in some aesthetic aesthetic form . but th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and use a touch screen , or if that's will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l it's possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .  the extra functions , you you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all the options will become available and you just c s scroll through them .  then i'd like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen , use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .  yes .  i agree , but it's very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , use just for special options a part of the touch screen .

TS3007b.C,"hi . i see my bunny is still standing . no one drawing it . figured that much . when you mentioned improving functions , what what do by that what are you think about ? the funtionability .  focusing more on the used buttons .  could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function  ma perhaps , just an idea .  i'll go , right i'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project .  what i did was i dissected current remote controls and viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i'll show it to you in a few seconds . and i'll explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . right . what i did was checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v_ or stereo and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , if we want to build remote control with bluetooth then the t_v_ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that's that wouldn't mean a cheap remote control for us . that's probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have very simple structure , that would probably mean lower costs and i that could mean for us a good thing we should be able to build a relatively cheap cheap remote .  as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth  it may be possible , but figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's something for marketing to look into . f because my personal opinion is is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although  actually i have t  i actually i figured that would be rather but then you'd still have the the infrared function . in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep beep  something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be may be something to explore . i'll just explain a bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . we didn't and we don't have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that's that's the h user won't be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened or i press button but nothing's happening on the t_v_ , is something wrong that's just to to explain the of to make it clearer to the user .  the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , in this case the television .  my personal preferences here ,  we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said  the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you don't use them , why should we invent spend more time on those . think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving .  no input from the television .  we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , and in order to receive the signals from what's on t_v_ and such .  i figure that would be spending too much money and time and yes , but what should we i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control . these all all that we have to take in account . my personal opinion is no receiver  we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons o of switching it open the usual and don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . that was my my personal opinion . and that was my my presentation    but  but  but  you d you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure ,  you have to keep in mind that not all not ","when you mentioned improving functions , what what do by that focusing more on the used buttons . could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function i'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and viewed how they w looked , what components are involved , and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i'll show it to you in a few seconds . and i'll explain a bit about how it works what i did was checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v_ or stereo and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , if we want to build remote control with bluetooth then the t_v_ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , that would mean extra cost for the user that's probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have very simple structure , we should be able to build a relatively cheap cheap remote . because my personal opinion is is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , i actually i figured that would be rather but then you'd still have the the infrared function . but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep beep something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . i'll just explain a bit of the components . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery i figured that would be best , the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch when a button is prush pushed in , electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that's that's the h user won't be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ?

TS3007c.A,"hello again .      yes . yes . your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . hello again . it's the same as the last time . also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . and at the end , when i finish it off i have some input from master class i visited . information .  the the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . our from are of two sorts . components concepts and user interface concepts . the first one is really about the the total package with we have decided to do a do the with a touch screen that must be a case around it it won't be as breakable . how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? the user interface concept . with the type and the supplements . where to put what button . and would say jans , can you begin ?  at the end , i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder .     one little question . about the material . soft material for a remote control ?       but you prefer kinetic ?  but you don't move a remote control too much . and that's enough to keep the energy level    tim .   dynamic look ?   a little artistic .  it's soft . that's the material the younger people want ain't it ? just like the watch from seiko .  i would prefer both too . combine them .   rubber .   me too .       do your thing , tim . bring it on .      flashy .  but wood is not a material you which you build a remote control of . but never seen one . case . a wooden look ,    would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or        you could use your remote as a phone . there are numbers on it ,  that you say s_p_s_s_ , and it goes to    but you don't use that th games when you watching television ,   you take your remote control with you .  great .         we can discuss a little about the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition .  there's n not too much decision on that one that parental control is a good function to to put in the remote . i don't know how you think about it .   no but most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , they can finally watch it because of that .      think that's a b there's a big market for it , because you you read many times in magazines same and you heard on the news that that he they believe that children are influenced by the television , and we're aiming to below forty years . but there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or     that's a better idea ?   with and one without .  it can work with show view . you can control your video recorder with show view . when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . but there's some option that that t the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . that's true .   i wouldn't put it in an optional device . that then it becomes too much , if we do it , we must do it in a ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .    and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that becomes too much . it's more like it gets you to the functionality , but     and games ? that would  that will that must be in it , you think ? the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are optional ?    but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just   you yo but most often not .    think we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . too too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it .  we have we have decided little more .  like a moat or s  but you have that in the  you use the it's already incorporated a little in that concept .  we take it to the other meeting ,  i have a little w little chat to do and then we finish . i went to master class and two things are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it's very hot at the moment , it's mostly for the management expert to look what other marketing or did i said management ?  just talking about myself .

TS3007c.B,"hello . project manager , i have something to tell you . i have a little problems with my laptop . and had a little less time to complete . no , a little problem , big problem . thought it didn't work anymore . the entire windows it hung .  during lunch , he's the master ,   have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? w nah .         th .       you should use kinetic as a back up . a combination ,  psycho kinetic . buy a fifty cents battery and  have something in my presentation to to cope with that . isn't possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . or do you think it rubber casing ,  ask it right now the question that i have . is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch screen square ? it isn't , we're we put fashion in electronics , we can   i get it .  that's good . as long a as long as it's it's firm , and you don't it's not bendable i th that goes too far .   it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .  do your thing .  spongeball .  it'll float . tables .  hey .  twelve fifty when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . take it . s   in the interface contents . that's a just simple powerpoint mock up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you i'll draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . always display the primary buttons clear and visible . even li like this with uses of a lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . if you press system , that's multiple system options can , five or ten or one , can fit in . or even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . and how do do we want to look at does a remote look it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that's too difficult for this one . you can make it s a little broader . and here ? and use your thumb on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the volume control and program control and , down here , i added , this could be one big l_c_d_ . the menu structure . you can use it in in this way .  one thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you're programming the colour of the t_v_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and you kn you all know the t_v_ levels . channel one , two . and when you get to n to to ten , ye and want to go back , you have a problem . just m most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . the s a button less . and things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like  w i find i must trying to tell it . is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus .  yes . or if you're watching studio sports on on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two yes , that's a good idea . but my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . and if you're using that button a lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just don't have to play games in between . but if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time to d use the other options . already told that . that's my conclusion . i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . system properties , parental control .   w it has to be fast . you don't want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .  why  you c may use like when there's x_p_ , simple log on , d you just push one or two or three . and if you push parents , then to log in .  and if you puts a ye  and if you w you push p children , you don't have to log in , but you can only watch children's channels or    some idea on that . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles ","i have a little problems with my laptop . and had a little less time to complete . it didn't work anymore . the entire windows but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . always display the primary buttons clear and visible . and make the menu structure changeable . one thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . and things like teletext , put them in the menu . but my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . you don't want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . you c may use like when there's x_p_ , simple log on , d you just push one or two or three . just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , ",The user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons.

TS3007c.B,"b still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones . you're thinking about some channels they cannot see , but i when for the f for all the standard channels , and only for after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and some timing will be needed instead of of channels , because if you're watching i don't know , you're in the at day cartoons will come up m on friday night . i don't know .   the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , will have to decide that isn't possible . you could say if parental control is only it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page up then , but  on a separate menu option .  a mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . but i don't think when you're watching t_v_ hearing loud noises from the t_v_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches ,  w you can put it on chip anyway , as long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote , but optional in but how we do it ? also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . we should make it too complex . is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how it's gonna work will f be a problem .   ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option . you can put on  and you can just when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password it's a p you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there's just some little clock in the remote . no , it's very simple . there th i h i've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock .     that's to put it very blunt , that's not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it's not a part of the remote . you have to f or make it ourselves very diffic        i'm listening .  what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all you can program .  som some bench marker .  logo .    you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . and it l linger on every time you see it . very annoying .   i it's for f for the next meeting , right ?    stay here and  p_ . no new email .  very much .   see you .  here ? or if you got a no . stupid manager . no . don't get what's ","but i don't think when you're watching t_v_ hearing loud noises from the t_v_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple .

TS3007c.C,"hi .         let me see . it's this one . ha . right . i'll be talking about the components . what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups . below forty five and above . and just watch what the differences are and i checked what d do we want , and how can we aim a at the target group . what i found was that a senior senior citizens ye it's  they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , soft and fluffy and colourful and shapes are curved and round . y you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . firs yes .  no , i'll get to that . you'll see . first off , let's start with the energy . w i had a choice between few different sources . but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that's when you move something , then it gets energy . i figured , that's ki kinda high tech , when you have a remote control that when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very figured . we could also use a battery , that's a bit you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . and then it d then it has some more energy . y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ? i actually did . but about solar panel is you have to have l light . sunlight preferably . and you could use normal light , but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery for ultimate b use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you'd have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you bit less space for the interface .  it wo what's actually i c just in f i've figured it out that seeing that you'll always be within the l distance of t_v_ , and the from t_v_ there comes a whole bunch of light . it would actually power itself from a t_v_ . but , you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used .  i prefer kinetic because it's the costs aren't that much higher , and ju just a bit more high tech than a normal battery . if no , but you pick it up and you press buttons and y you actually it is . and it if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . exactly . and that f furthermore , you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha i you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was square and figured that's a bit boring . you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . single curve , it's just a it's just curve . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that's like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec that gives you a younger and more high tech look , i f i figured . but , that we'll discuss later . what ? you want me to draw in three d_ ? i ca i could show you . i could show you . let's say y you let's say that's your standard that's a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like something like this . and then in three d_ effect you could go you just this is a this bit difficulty in i didn't take a major in art . but but you could have whole new the back the depth , you could just play around a bit with . you don't have to use standard you could y it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just a furthermore , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what's better , plastic or rubber . i ch prefer rubber because it feels it's soft and it's that i like soft .  mean plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your i usually associate plastic with something that's cheap . that's just me , but we could talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or a touch screen . we discussed it in a previous meeting , figured i'll just leave it at the l_c_d_ . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . but if we decide to go on a n l_c_d_ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with it . that's something we th have to keep in mind . if it isn't manageable budget wise , we'd have to go over to to sim to simple buttons .   probably . probably , but that's that's that shouldn't be that big a issue . i'll i'll just add , put a big summary here , we could discuss it a bit . what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?

TS3007c.D,"hey , project manager . what was it , problem ? the laptop ? it hang hung . ha .  project manager . you're our project manager .    master . master of   i'm go on .    but when the power gets low , you have to shake it and  it's too less space .   and when the battery doesn't work , i usually shake it too . like slamming on it . it's exactly the same .   but , are you going to draw it ? the   i c i can't imagine . i can't imagine how it looks like .  design .        we're going to sell tell ten millions of them . bet a big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us big discount on the chips , u usually , chips are aren't more expensive than one dollar .  that shouldn't be a real issue ,  a combination .  like an aku acu  combine them .  fifty cent . rubber . rather hard .  that touch screens are generally square . but it's the case you put around it that makes the shape .   but if you have a square l_c_d_ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d_ screen . that that's it's custom customisable and me too .       can i do my thing ? it expert map .  last week i went to paris and milan for some trend watching . for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . findings . our main audience , that's people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . considering material ,  they like spongy material , like sponge ball . like a s soft material . janus m mentioned it also . he did some some findings himself . you wer you weren't in paris ? like this . like big flashy colours . fresh . it's our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .  materials like wood that no n j just a w no , but just a wooden look . like you have those fake fake panels on the floor . the that isn't wood anyway , but  but , that's our secondary audience . we decided to take the people below forty . that this doesn't apply . the third . there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . and easy to use . but that's common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and therefore use fresh colours . i'll come to that in a second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . a third , material being used could be like rubber . two advantages . it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the  exactly . in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . it's very innovative . innovative . like something . you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and but , we have to keep the cost in in mind , but it it can be very expensive . second . building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . also the link with mobile phones . no , but no , but you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . it's just the same .  when you're at college . no . you al you also take you take your ipac and go play games .  i do that , but and and third , i stick with it , the log in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . that's it .     what do you think about a back and forth come up button ? l like in internet explorer .  but does it that is for going from four to five . but if you go from two to eight , and you want and on two . that you can switch easy . it is .  no . that's it .    but what i see how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log on screen with parents , children . something like that . and w when you want to use the parents option , you have to   pu push parents . that then then you have to go to three digit log in . like two one three . and it's in . it automatically goes   v violent t_v_ .    w it just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally ","but if you have a square l_c_d_ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d_ screen . that's it's custom customisable and i went to paris and milan for some trend watching . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , that's people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . they like spongy material , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . materials like wood that they have to look fancy . they should be technological in innovative . and easy to use . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and therefore use fresh colours . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . and third , i stick with it , the log in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log on screen with parents , children .

The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material. He explained that the remote should look fancy, and be technologically innovative and easy to use. He suggested using removable customisable covers, speech recognition, installing some games into the remote, and implementing a parental control feature. The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition. "
