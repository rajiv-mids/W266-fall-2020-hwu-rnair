ES2002a.A,"and i like whales . they come in and go eat everything in sight . you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . one factor would be production cost . ",The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal. The team then discussed various features to consider in making the remote. 
ES2002a.B,"this is the kick off meeting for our project . we're designing a new remote control and as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . and there are three different stages to the design . we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . m my favourite animal is my own dog at home . he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , fifty percent of the selling price . i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it like how much does , a remote control cost . twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds don't know how good a remote control that would get you . but i suppose it has to look and gimmicky . right , do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d do your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? extra functionalities . you keep losing them . w you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . like a touch screen inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it for user interface , technical functions , and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , what requirements it has to fulfil it's th the functional design stage is next , you probably want some unique selling point of it , ",The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal.

ES2002a.C,"my favourite animal would be a monkey . then they're small cute and furry , my parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . for them it was just how many devices control . ",The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal. 
ES2002a.D,"my favourite animal is like   a beagle . right , high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . and , that they have lots of personality but selling price is that wholesale or retail ? right away i'm wondering if there's th like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . as as characters , different keypad styles and s symbols . i'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . one way of looking at it would be , the people producing television sets , they have to buy remote controls . or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses what we could use is a like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm pilots . wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market , we could think about how , could be more , streamlined . s or whatever would be technologically reasonable . are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? or are we keeping like a design commitment to television features ?

ES2002b.A,"which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . twenty five euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? not the high end range , but middle , middle up ish . twenty five to thirty five is fair to add that in as a group as these are people who are gadgety , right ? one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . but what i'm saying is that we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular technology , rather than focusing on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . this is just the working design guess i try to define like what we're doing now , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like back in the back of our minds we the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . i'll go into the diagram first . it just explains how the process goes through , from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need you need some power source . a battery to keep it going . and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last . like voice recognition , right . that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , that's one perhaps constraint there . th the basic thing is there's a user interface and that picks up an input from a user , a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself like voice recognition , right , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . you wanna go back to what the functions are ? w i'm done . you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , these aren't technology options in that sense . a basic principles and basic components that are needed . each component represents one function , but the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . there might be one other consideration which would be that the transmission between the remote control and the t_v_ are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra red thing ? because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . right . if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . because if you're using infra red , the line of sight say the t_v_'s at that chair , and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . there's not much specific information , from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , you need a docking cradle , for you to put it in to charge . or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . then i don't think rechargeable is something we should we really need to care about . another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? could suggest we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non basic . device is anything which we can't categorise , right . and then video is anything that you can see .

ES2002b.B,"we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . guess just to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other a little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , cost wise how much money we had to s just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into production , the time to market . we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . th because on the company website , what does it say do they is that something they want actually written on it , it's quite long . those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the t_v_ , and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company . time for presentations then . think it's a valid point . like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , you get a lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , and then actual numbers for channels as god , i wou i would say that's required , there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , any like display controls do you think we need to worry about , far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and and then just things that would be if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , like a mute button , hard to where your role ends , it you wanna group all the different types of functions together , one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our target audience , our target market . if we want something that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? who wou who would have the money to spend . it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , i suppose , do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ? we are gonna have to narrow it down , and there needs to be some selling point to it . if we are going to include speech recognition , it's between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high tech . shall we make the decision to include speech recognition might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , is if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people with a physical disability as do you think we need like further advances in that area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? do you wan do you wanna finish up your whole presentation then ? worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect how long it took us to get this to market , th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our our creative influence on this on the user interface because it's tried and tested intra red , we could stay with tha in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t_v_ , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? just stick to regular i'm just gonna just recap what i said at the start , was that the whole point of this meeting was to f finalise who we're gonna aim this at , are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? and also the funct the actual functions of what it's gonna do . it's as optional functions . and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . guess just to confirm that we we're doing in the next in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , for our industrial designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . and you'll all get specific instructions as that's definitely a good idea . you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like your bass settings and actual volume hi brightness , contrast , things like that , guess just things to think about are like the fact it's gotta look good , something quirky in design make it ergonomic to hold , ",The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote.

ES2002b.C,"this is the technical functions design . to do the the design i have i've had a look online , i've had a look at the homepage , i've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer having a look at the existing products , i found out that it tends to come in two extremes , there's either very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't you're doing . in that case the labelling tends to be very bad . here the button there and there . that one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . not if you had a look at the other control in that example . it's a very simple one . it's got only the basic functions but it's the same size as the hard to use one . it looked a bit clunky . they're very big and not very much use for buttons . and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . my own preferences , i prefer the clunky one . believe the advanced functions should be hidden in a drawer , now i'd like to ask for your preferences . the clunky one is the one on the right . think it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . do we have any functions that we'd want on it ? far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . i reckon one problem with speech recognition is you end up yelling at the control for hours . i've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , it'd probably quite expensive to put in . we just say that it was gonna be the most basic possible . on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to a channel . we include mute , but apart from that think we just we'll go for the simpleness .

ES2002b.D,"and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . we're saying we want this to be a product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? one way i would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types , that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're in a little area but covered up things like channel and volume are used all the time , we just have them right out on top , we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . and then others that are concealed . whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of redundancy in the issues and the the things . what i've already started doing is cr i created a slide in my presentation here that we think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and mine , what you've just told me impacts a lot on what like market research that i've been before i bring this up what i'll just say is what i've done is tried to collect some information that then relay this to you guys that it's now becomes a collective thing . and then lead us in the direction of deciding , what are our options , what should we decide what i got is looked into some information and th tried to think about how we could review it and what decisions we could take away from it i'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs , and what are issues with existing products . and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision this is what i've found here , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . most people find them ugly . the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . they tend to use the most simple controls if for me this is sorta like three different inspirations , one is that we want something that's high tech but we want it to seem easy . and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . they get lost a lot , takes time to learn how to use them . and i will admit i don't r_s_i_ stands for . adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . now we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . if that's possible we might consider getting into it . recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . my hope here is that i'm putting out this information that we can then say how do we collectively move on with it . haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , where's the money , mostly focused around the twenty five age group . young professional , it does fit with the market that we're identifying , could it be an on off thing ? it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , since we're on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ? is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin does c is our controller is it have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment , that's good . and is it going to include any of the the more advanced features , is it not an option still that we include some things just as a under like under a door or some what i'm i'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then they , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . great . shall we agree for sake of clarity and when we r resume that we'll u use this idea david's proposed , where we think of these three buckets and anything we discuss about them is we're talking about this . and then k i suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard ",The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote.

ES2002c.A,"like you said time to market was a problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost . and the power is factor of that . and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , guess three things , cost , complexity , and the size . i'm not very about the voice thing got another email and it was quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . your basic components are buttons , and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , there's an l_c_d_ display , then there's how the case actually looks . it can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , don't think you can use them in a combination , think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , the rubber was a restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had a different things on the shape of the thing , but it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . and the other components are logic chips , again i'll go back to the component chips . the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the unit don't think the logic chip has a issue about size they should be about the same size . power consumption should be about the same . and the other thing is the power options . the first one is a standard battery . the second one is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind up a crank .  but that might be something that's more of a look and feel decision because i don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . whatever it is you still need a battery the other ones are a solar powered cell , and the kinetic one for me is the most interesting one you have you had those balls , those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it lights up and it goes , that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not small you can't , like a phone too small phone . the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it the user interface restrictions means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard the l_c_d_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . the case with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . there's no restriction on the plastic , and on the wood . think we could because the l_c_d_ panel requires power , and the l_c_d_ is a form of a light that's why the option of the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . do we need an l_c_d_ display ? what would we achieve from it ? that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , where would you physically position the buttons ? glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . but because the case is transparent it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . the question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . it might work for volume , and some of the brightness controls and like that , but not for channels right . that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . a slide , because then you don't have to put the hand . feel like fruit .

ES2002c.B,"i'll just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . decided on our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non rechargeable battery powered , that we're gonna group our audio visual and other functions into those categories , and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan . should also point out that the the final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . it's yellow like a phone like the backlight in a phone . something quite curvy ? about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it much . and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about the colour of the whole product being yellow was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch . it feels a bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an l_c_d_ display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , i would've thought . i would say no need for a talk back . mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back up of the battery , but have kinetic power , i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons s like cur slightly transparent case , it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can see through it . and the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , know that the designers are gonna be working with play doh on that .

ES2002c.C,"there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , i've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this we're looking for suggestions on size th size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , and they're very easily lost . the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . the stand by button isn't always red , the buttons should be large . they should be easy to press , very comfortable . the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . should avoid s things like that . if the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour that it can be easily identified anywhere . any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , we should definitely avoid the big square block look . and they've said th the voice control can now talk back if you ask it a question . it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . it's fashion into electronics . and we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . think we could go for like not a p a fruit shape but a very curvy type shape . you could have the same texture and colour as a fruit . probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , feels right in your hand . i'd quite like a snowman type shape . p larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . that'd probably scare me . think the advanced ones the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .

ES2002c.D,"what i wanna do here , before we get into it too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , and not , it specified , not a functional look or feel , f fancy . number two was that it be innovative . and third priority for ease of use , is that what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not much to the functionality of it . top european fashion trend that i read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , especially in clothes and furniture . my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and you might say ergonomic or friendly to handle , and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours softness in materials , shape , and function , i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we're then making it s more of like a comfortable type of we think of some thin theme that unifies it all , sorta like a marketing identity . like the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like like lemon like that , like it could light up in different colours or people could buy the control and then it comes with different like covers can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? i'm thinking along the lines of you're in the dark watching a d_v_d_ and you you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up we're gonna need to put in a really good battery people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and pieces of concept and technology or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize . what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the the colour , and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . as you scroll through , we said we might have a jog dial , as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small . but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . backlighting , that would be good . and then the other thing that we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and i'm thinking should we try and think about having something like some an innovative concept about how the the volume and the channels are controlled , that's the main thing people will f wanna do . could we use like a jog dial , like a just round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? and that we've got like the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , think the jog dial , what if it was flat and you just spun it , and we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , that'd just be standard . and also t plastic i've seen can get really textured , you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .

ES2002d.A,"the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use . they're in the l_c_d_ panel and the jog dial ? the l_c_d_ panel just displays functionally what you're doing . if you're using an advanced function right , like brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say it might even be one , a bit more complex l_c_d_ panel with pictures like the sun or the , the symbols of the various functions . that's a number pad . we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? be about th three and a half . lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them . audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid range , your high range . left right balance , even pre programmed sound modes , no .  we need an advanced chip we're gonna have to skip the rubber . for the case itself , one colour . it's one special colour . we've got push buttons as let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . the other thing could be that you could take away the l_c_d_ panel and the advanced chip together , when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . then these just become normal coloured buttons , that's something that's very hard to catch , you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .  we should do the design evaluation first . i rate that pretty highly . the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , the yellow is more representative of the colour , the constraints do come in very fast . another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , and the fact that we're wearing these things restricts it does actually affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . and the time given also restricts the interactions are very structured . i don't think there's a sense of control all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , that's the word . the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the whiteboard , and that m is also does hinder us and things and a lot of the information on the powerpoints , i don't think , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as but the pen is v is very intuitive , think the pen's good . and the computer may not be conducive to a meeting because you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , and we have ninja homer . i did learn something new , play doh is useful . it is useful and in in conceptualizing , in being creative . like we were playing with the play doh and the ideas came with the play doh rather than with everything else . it becomes tangible .

ES2002d.C,"i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . closer to three even or two and a half . but just in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , what about button shape ? square buttons ? i've reviewed all of the the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the for the current design th or the plan , to bring together two things , design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is v high in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , and we've been asked to to collectively rate this , the first one stylish look and feel . let's go with five then . fi just actually the opposite . let's go with two point five then . high tech innovation . we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog dial style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . we'll go two . and design is simple to use , simple in features . soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we've used mostly plastic in the end it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? and it's within budget , out of forty nine with zero being the highest . we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . it's pretty good . in theory this process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . it's not something i need to p push through , but should we thinking more about the dimensions , like more of a three dimensional shapes as as opposed to just that flat  it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we put out our ideas and then , answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there's tease of creativity we're told think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , actually the creativity was more of like a f f formality then an actual in reality here the different elements of leadership such as the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . and it is leadership almost to the point of disempowering the team member , but it's not bad leadership , it's just fairly strong , without a doubt . taking upon that idea , w the way i see this i is that it's the s the structure in which we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the tasks were d divided , and then the work went on in isolation the whiteboard , for me , is the thing i would use all the time , just in the way that we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board as opposed to in like in text . i know that people who design cars and in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a context to walk around and puzzle and point and discuss and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . and o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . we only actually needed one computer . the w main one for me is that the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . it's hard to keep f working forward on a team based project when you're told you must now work away from your team .

ES2003b.A,"this is a brief run through of the of the technical functions of the remote . the presentation is already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices i've looked at a num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . and there's two main trends in th in the design practice . on the one hand and this this particularly relates to its earliest models where with many buttons on it giving you every possible function that the device has , the remote control controls . it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . and on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what is most likely to get used . and there is a certain amount of loss of function here and you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . but the pro the problem with a lot of the user focused designs that are about is that they make assumptions in advance about what what a given user's going to want mo want to do from want it to do most . something that's something that is more programmable , that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . liked ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a fairly minimal number of function buttons , you then have some basic display on it that if you're cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what each direction of the of the joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . i was thinking that the remote the default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume , left and right for channels . think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white . si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you then get to menu navigation . with things like ch with things like tuning and channels adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway most of the of the replacement remote market is remote control rationalisation . you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? then our market should be t_v_ manufacturers , rather than the public . actually i would say two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and and an og and an button . certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for the o the other dis design constraint we should bear in mind is that people are very much used to using a remote control one handedly , a small speaker if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .

ES2003b.B,"we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ a bit more , mentioning of bar code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as it's come to my attention the following . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . due for time to market and possibly also cost issues . also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , your colour and slogan is down at the bottom there . just to say quickly would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . if anybody disagrees we can definitely say i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , if you could speed it up a bit , i hear what the marketing expert's saying about voice activated control . however i've got a couple of worries about that . the power required , and the ability to the cost , it seems like for an embedded system , this could us issues . voice activation could be an interesting idea but that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's not feasible . however the idea of a joystick and then an l_c_d_ which has been put forward far , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , i don't know how much power an l_c_d_ would take , literally if you can imagine the display slightly larger than those on a mobile phone , something where you can read an fair amount of information , traverse quite a few menus , and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s we're almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose . i imagine as that the actual l_c_d_ and to a certain extent the joystick as would be for the additional functionality . and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined . we go for the standard up and down for and volume control . this is a requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid , i would say yes , i would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . however i don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is . the other option is that the digital telephones , one unit has you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but it's a button that you attach to the t_v_ . something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . again say what , it would be a small transmitter , watch battery type scenario i would say , that might be something that we could look into . that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l_c_d_ . we could use say the left and right for changing channels we could even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , l_c_d_ , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? that would require a transmitter attached to the t_v_ , and what , a small microphone on the actual unit , th e the true fact , considering the cost of an l_e_d_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . you could go for quite an interesting design . something that can make it stand out slightly . feel free to email me if you think that we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . user interface , we also need to get the slogan in here , we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . but it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? and possibly the two r_s to signify the company . rather than real reaction .

ES2003c.B,"to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on small joystick , l_c_d_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . this meeting is the conceptual design phase and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , the bat the battery for a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an l_c_d_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? or ? we have to look into the costs of those . in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an l_c_d_ looks ? that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . seems like a lot of the components could be off the shelf , having the use of the l_c_d_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , say something like lithium ion battery , looks like we going for a double curved design . don't cost implications there are in that . looks like we're decided on some flexible rubber . though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some inner frame . do you think there's any way we could remove the articulation ? but it could be a weak point in the structure , do you think ? if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l_c_d_ you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . the target audience is anybody under the age of say sixty ludicrous . your idea of the u_s_b_ would would largely depend on the cost . u_s_b_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , the idea was that it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the p_c_ for a larger programming programming it to use your t_v_ , you might hook it up to the p_c_ . i'm not but i'm thinking that the additional cost of the u_s_b_ might be prohibitive . you're gonna look at product evaluation . looks like we're gonna need a prototype in clay . we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . possibly i'm think i'm not but i'm seeing a little bit of space around the joystick area which could be used .

ES2003c.C,"i also have a preference for rubber . we compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of or they want it to look and then we research fashion trends in europe , we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look more than they want it to be as in they want it to do a lot of good s and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care much , technology technical technologically innovative . people want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . like the interface is really important . and easy to use , it just happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important the second point is twice as important as the third point . the fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . how that relates to a remote control i don't know . spongy . if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , it's spongy , then can i skip the rest ? kinda spongy material . we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , but what we need is something that looks like it's from the future now the fruit and veg options , either we go in that direction or we stay away from it . but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple like that , or a kiwi fruit . few questions about a spongy remote control . i've never seen one before . if we want something strong and sturdy , i say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , don't know how the l_e_d_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material if we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and also , this was this year . things change all the time , every year  the noise for when you lose the banana , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a monkey noise like that , rather than a standard beep . y you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams like that to direct you towards the banana . i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . now it'd be if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s , you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . at this stage we still have no target audience ","The industrial designer presented options for batteries, materials and shapes to use for the case, buttons, and chips.

ES2003c.D,"the case le that's what i wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . but later on we found out that it can be rubber as or titanium or even wood . we decide what it's gonna be . probably plastic . we need the infra red transmitter . joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , could be plastic w or rubber even as three different types of batteries . can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , that they use in watches , or else solar powered one . and solar cells , about that . we should probably just use conventional batteries . just like in usual remote controls . and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . but you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , double curved . it probably means this is probably double curved . whereas a single curved would be like that . it looks better than the single curve , but you can't have it in titanium , and for the buttons , it can have the scroll wheel but it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use l_c_d_ it's even more expensive . you have to decide , there's trade offs there . if you have a double curve control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as i reckon you're gonna have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the remote control . translate the key press into an infra red signal and this is received by the t_v_ . and then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , to get sent to the chip . think we can do it if we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . and then use single curved case . the rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .

ES2003d.A,"if we both step up and outline our ideas . do doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is h i is down here for the l_e_d_ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , but as you see with the with holding it in the left hand , the l_ the l_c_d_ is nowhere useful , that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design . i got your note about keeping the cost down . this design could be done with with plastic casing . though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more bio morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as as for the as for the single curve , this edge and this edge , like i say it would be to have some curvature to it , really the curve that's most needed is the underside and you have the transmitter here and a wee speaker for the for the fi for the remote control finder . if we could still do the rubber , i though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the of the rigid substructure . it has a wee tail that you just drape over your wrist that's still part of the design . and making it a bright colour helps i'd say number one . suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it circular if we remove the l_c_ display then there was no point to any of these meetings ho how much extra would it be to keep keep the the articulation ? that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . but it was just completely pointless . b i it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice . l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case yellow . three . we can do three . it doesn't get much fancier . i'd give it a three for this for that . the menus thing is something you don't normally see on on a remote , i'd s i'd give it a six , to be honest . i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours . we went with yellow for the prototype leopard print would be this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . i'd i don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros for something that's only marginally good ? this is a the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the of the researchers studying this . though it would have been to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves . unti until accounts came along , th to r retaining the s the more bio morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in something that could perhaps be part of the product the product testing market research process would be to produce mock ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over budget would make to sales .

ES2003d.B,"just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , something that looks good that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l_c_d_ display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , just before we go through all of the steps here , what we'll do is if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation is there anything here that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? and then we'll come back promptly to this . slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . most of it stems from the use of the l_c_d_ which in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , or what we did was that we we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs we've got point two of a euro left over there . even then as there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick i've used what i think's appropriate . it blows a lot of our really good ideas slightly to one side , the possibility of having a u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now . we've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the l_c_d_ . i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some solid design , possibly meaning that the l_c_d_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . you now have as much information as i do . i've said single curved . we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . plastic for some reason incurs no cost , if i've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button . as you can see , the use of an l_c_ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as because it's an integrated scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what they had in mind with a joystick . i'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . no , we haven't , not if we remove the l_c_ display , we could save ourselves if we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . but for the purposes of this meeting , i'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures . i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l_c_ display are people not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the l_c_d_ ? would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , mean for the purposes of this meeting we can state that single curve still allows articulation . one point five of a euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . i quite like that colour that you're fetching there , make it glow in the dark even better . we'll come back to your evaluation just to give you an idea , you want to go bit quickly as i'd say we're doing there . plastic , it sucks . it would also help keep the product placement it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , and we can make it yellow , and that's banana like . considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive even based on the four of us being heavily biased , probably the people technologically . quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction . does anybody want to do you have any opinions on any of them ? people made good use of the pen and paper ? i'm not quite what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? leadership . as much as can be leadered in this thing . last one we've got is room for creativity . of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly . not much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . we needed a larger budget . it's gone today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and such . it is very much a pity to get far into the stage and then find out that some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . is there anything else that anybody would like to add , ","The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features.

ES2006b.A,"you said targ target groups , what does that mean ? with regard to the working design of this remote control i've identified few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective i c we can now know wha what exactly the components are the identification of the components , and since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects , i would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person . we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level these were the basic findings from today . the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other . also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . also the management wants that our design should be unique it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard . he here is a functional overview of the remote control . there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . the user interf interface communicates with the chip , if if this is our energy source and this is a cell , it communicates it feeds energy into the chip , which finds out h how to do everything . there is a user interface here . whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , the there can be bulb here to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . whatever new functions that we need to do , make the chip more complicated and bigger , i in my personal preferences i'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . this would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . and also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design , that our remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most televisions . no , i don't have any idea about what each component costs . we definitely need to operate within our constraints , in the u user interface requirements we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . at this stage , how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or in we can completely do away with buttons and have some fancy user interface like that . think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . we can probably until t we have more knowledge on that . if the costs allow , we can have like an l_c_d_ display because we do want something fancy and fashionable as some ring , one of the very interesting things that came up in ka kate cat's presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people . if we need to have a target group then think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and good looking we are better off targeting a younger audience then people who are comparatively elderly . bu but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was but voice recognition itself i'm not very about , what wh what i was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that person can say , i want to watch i_t_v_ one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five . and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control wh another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the t_v_ , you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , we can probably come to know where it is .

ES2006b.B,"what i have , wh where i've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent of users would spend more to get a looking remote control . current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour dunno what zapping is , but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , that's going back to what , we were saying earlier about , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . this is my little graph thing . what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . what you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . what the graph shows is that , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , nobody really uses and that's the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , and , channel selection and volume selection are essential , and the power , it's not quite essential , and everything else , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . you can see from that , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but d i do wonder how that would work given that a t_v_ , tends to be people talking and how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t_v_ . these are my personal preferences . you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , something that's , a bit functional , it's useful , but minimalist . things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and i was thinking that solar power would be quite because , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . and then like a locator , like you have for a mobile phone or something where you clap and then it beeps , that's that it didn't say in the survey , whether , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , seventy six point three percent . but it has been proven that people of that age group have a higher disposable income like it is an age group to target , really , the fact that , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . y you'd need a code word . but like you'd just say remote five , remote ten , remote one two nine . it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , ","The marketing expert presents, giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects.

ES2006b.C,"now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing a little bit less talking than i did last time this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , i put it in the sh shared documents folder . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . at the last minute , then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control as who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , we need to have a fairly defined group that we want to focus on just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just that i don't have to scribble everything down . do you have any idea about costs at this point ? that's something to consider , if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . the blue function key at the bottom and f_ eight . computer no signal . but if we had a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and d_v_d_ , i could get back to them and see . it's switching between channels , randomly going through . whistle and it screams at you , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss then again the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the i don't know how often they're buying televisions . i would've thought it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their toys and and if we're talking twenty five euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote . if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? with but with a t_v_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , tha that should be relatively simple . but if you wanna look into that just to check . that if that was in the voice recognition , that would be great . but if we go away with that general specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option but that needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning what we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some summarisation , send me your presentations that use them to make the minutes , and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . i'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but i'll send you an email when i do it , that as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . you'll be looking at the user interface concept , and you're watching trends to see how we go w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some summary .

ES2006b.D,"since we were discussing some design issues then i would like to continue i don't see anything on my computer now . that's fine , that's good . i'm going to speak about technical functions design my method was to look at other remote controls , mostly just by searching on the web and then after having got this inspiration and having compared what i found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what what the user might desire as additional functionalities . the findings were that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set , and some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , then the user would like to switch the channel just m changing to the next channel to flip through all of the possible channels , or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel , we would need the numbers . and also the volume is very important . among the findings i found that m most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design , like operating a v_c_r_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with d_v_d_ players , but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . my personal preferences would be to keep the the whole remote control small just like the physical size . and then it must be easy to use , it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and the colour tends to be red but then other functionalities could be just there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu . the last question i had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . and also it's other question is because there are many different and there are many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d_v_d_ there are the video c_d_s and whatever , it might be problematic to choose between all these possible things . the buttons are still the most easy for the user to use , what other options would you have ? a little screen but this would be really lot of learning for the user and the user just wants to get get a result quickly , not to spend time in like giving several orders dunno . th i would think the put the buttons , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a t_v_ to use its full but at the same time we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target , because actually they're all still re young people . w now the v the voice recognition if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just used to buttons but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you probably might just speak into it no , but i was just defending the fact why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and not to yell at it from the distance .

She pinpoints the main functions of on/off, channel-switching, numbers for choosing particular channels, and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen.

ES2006c.A,"haven't made a powerpoint presentation , i'll use the whiteboard instead . i'll use the whiteboard because we have many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are m or highlighting or underlining them like that . i'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control if you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that i was talking about last time . this sends information to a tr transistor here , which then sends the information to an l_e_d_ device here . if you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , you see particular button attaches to a particular place on the p_c_b_ on pressing this button i a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes out through there . the important point that i read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit boards are quite cheap to make , these are the different options that we have . the batteries , i'll start with the battery , right ? they can be simple which is like the normal batteries in our the cells , and dynamos . don't know if even if you want to consider this , the third one is the kinetic energy ones . the kinetic energy one is that e they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . but if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . but as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it re recharges and the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . environment friendly . there are different cases that can be provided . they can be the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with one sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides .  there were different supplements available , like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? we can use even certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , it's it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it cannot be used on a double curved surface . the interface options now . we can have push buttons , like most remotes do we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers they can even have an integrated push button inside the scrolling thing . we can have l_c_d_s . th this concerns firs first of all the chips i showed you at the p_c_b_ is inexpensive , we can put in whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced . the good thing about wh why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that l_c_d_s can only come with the advanced chip . we need regular or advanced for scroll wheels . and the chip includes the infra infrared sender . besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , i'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like as soon as you press a button , it give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . whether sample sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . now think that we can integrate the user interface and the marketing things in that , are you wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the l_c_ display ? the ipod thing , as you're discussing things , is it if we just keep highlighting things here ? probably voice recognition is important , right ? i have a point about l_c_d_ , w l_c_d_s are for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , do we need an l_c_d_ on the remote ? now we seem to have a consensus that l_c_d_s are definitely the way to go because of style and if we use latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source we could use titanium , wood or plastic or probably double curved surface is the way to go , or curved at one end and flat on the top , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding because according to the information that i have , the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . it does not say anything about whether technically , this is available hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? kinetic energy does seem to have some appeal , this thing will have to be tapped every time , which might be very frustrating for the user . let's keep it option keep an option , it has to be at least curved from one side , wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? if you have an l_c_d_ display , then you can select almost everything on the l_c_d_ display . i'm not it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber .

ES2006d.C,"this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , you can show us what you've been working on diligently . then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . then i need to say some st a few things about finance , we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . and it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that but if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click you hold it in ? and it's with the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . i suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but we'll se i'm we can get around them somehow . for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . th there's the locator dot . i'd say six , the the standard layout for numbers is three and one , rather than the way you've got it . but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . but otherwise it's superb . g_ technologically innovative . all of the components have been used in other things before . what do you reckon , five , six ? put fashion in electronics . we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . and now we have to calculate the production costs . i've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that . started filling it in , no hand dynamo , right ? one simple battery . the chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . single curved surface , that we can fold it . case material we said rubber . i don't special colour means . it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? and button supplements . that seems unlikely . whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we i don't think that makes sense . as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . our budget's twelve point five . that has implications though for the . right , we need one fifty off . take it down to just a scroll wheel . the scroll wheel is on the side . we're point three over at the moment . look , we're way under budget or that we have to have some special colour . did we lose on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? we're gonna have a beep . it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . but in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that worked in terms of . the whiteboard digital pens . we like the pens . but that worked having a whiteboard that we could draw on as as having the powerpoint , did anyone feel that they were getting covered up and not being able to say their bit ? new ideas found . not quite what about . costs are within budget , one euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . we've evaluated the project . can you put that in the project documents file ? and the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . but if we've finished , then we've finished . would say that's the end of that meeting . right , we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . i don't see why you can't stay here , really .

ES2006d.D,"will you start with like the the shape and things and then i will explain the user interface th things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and but it's just an a approximation . it could be made a bit smaller , but one thing we actually forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , the user interface as we discussed last time on the cover we just have the very basic things . we have that n channels here starting from one two three it's four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . and then , this is on off button . and also the colour is quite often red , and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and and we would also have a l little thing saying here , previous and ne prevon next . the volume is scrolling . on the side , and it's on the back is cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . and you have the spinning wheel with options to choose . we'll have this on the screen , on the display . the scrolling is you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? and the voice recognition is also just part of it . you can't really see it in the interface . we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . we might do we might want to do like a another m model another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . or six , that you stick on t_v_ . if if this means intuitive , if it means the way people are used to finding things the ergonom ergonomic design mean i d dunno , the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons much on the remote control anyway , we have the sample speaker as which is it's new . six . fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , think we've done very the average is about six and something . six point five , something coloured , or if you want some pattern thing on it , we have pushbuttons , and we have l_c_ display but what do we ha we have l_c_ display , but the wh but the s spinning wheel we have to count all of them , the speaker the sample speaker is expensive , but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps . you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . we still have the locate . it can come in the same colour as the case . as far as creativity is concerned , think there was room for creativity . the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had . the m the means were very good , the means we used . and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the but but already just preparing the slides before the meeting , i was satisfied with the leadership , and then the teamwork it worked quite nicely , it's it's pretty new , and my main difficulty was the time pressure . it was a pleasure working with you .

ES2009b.B,"we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project . remote control works as follows . sends message to another system , there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . a user interface controls the chip , that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as and found that too much metal in remote design could potentially interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . and too much metal can remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . too much metal is used sometimes and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction . components . just some ideas that i had , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly thought we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . the user interface , since we can't use metal i was thinking high grade recycled plastic . the chip , silicon based chip i don't really see any way around that , the sender i'm thinking infrared it is the industry standard , pal and n_t_s_c_ compatible and probably a two hundred foot range . personal preferences , i really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , that shouldn't be a problem . it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . with a simple command like locate . and then it could start to beep gotta wonder though , if we're adding much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro goal for selling these things . it seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? off the top of my head it sounds like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . since we're doing touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the the actual interface part of it and things like that ? or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . what would be on that touch screen ? you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and logo or motto , think we just need to come up with a black and red interface on the touch screen . people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . they just want it to be on and ready to go .

's definitely an option technically . i've looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be almost as cheap as a button method at this point . if you take the example of a mobile phone that trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . we could have the casing , the face plates . have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a touch screen these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? i'm wondering how we're gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device . all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . i've put my files in the shared folder as ","The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products.

ES2009c.B,"what i'm gonna have to talk to you about today is component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do what i'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . components of a remote control , we've already gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail energy source , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . it's like a the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . but i don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . i imagine that we could specify . the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro . one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but there is light coming out of the remote one thing that might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just as a fun gimmick . you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . i am that we could do that . just as a fun gimmick . and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . we really don't have any way around the t_a_ one eight three five . we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . my personal preference is think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . i like the idea of the visible light signalling , and was thinking about i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . as far as the rubber that we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls . i like the idea of rubber too my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , that's just an estimate though . that's just off the top of my head , if we do both the production costs are going to go way up the voice recognition is simpler , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but since we already have the technology in house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work the solar power definitely would be but just to keep people from getting annoyed , we should install a small backup battery . it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and how those don't really require that much light , why , why moving away from hand held , why ? do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . just the squishy feel . about the lack of information on cost , haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers if , if we're not going the touch screen route then we can just incorporate something that folds out and something that slides down to reveal the more complicated things . we need to figure out what buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? rubber buttons ? have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit but having more cases also costs more ","The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group.

ES2009c.C,"interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . yur user interface , guys , is aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive . commands and mechanisms , that user uses to control the operator operating system . here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . the following are a bunch of different interface concepts . voice recognition , we actually have some new information from our research design team current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . our design team , research team , has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to with standard responses . like you could say good morning remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , good morning joe . another concept is what apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with l_c_ display like on the ipod and then we have the scroll button with integrated push button , like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , i don't think that's we're necessarily going for . and some special components , ideas like blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming but again if we go with touch screen i don't think that's a big issue . and this is the the big daddy of remote controls here . the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . mean my ideas here and where we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular ipod with a hard cla c plastic casing changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package touch screen interface , possibly having go to buttons being stuck into the system those don't move away from the screen , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . and our voice command system which i've talked a little bit about already and the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features that are around red for power , arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . and perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea where do you guys come up with these numbers ? that we really have two main selling points , that our casing and the voice recognition to be honest , we have the capa we have the design in house , we've come up with this , with this new voice we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . does having both really up our costs ? i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . if we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held remote control and have a round remote control that looks like a paperweight like that , sleek little neat thing that sits on your table if you don't need to pick it up it could be a selling point . to a certain extent we have to stick with little bit traditional in terms of the buttons ","The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition, a spinning wheel design, and a touch screen interface.

ES2009c.D,"i'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . remote control right now everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable thing . now i'm not saying we should have , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but it is possible to use natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , different skin options , and th the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , though if we can get around to getting piloting , casing option like not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like leather options or wood options perhaps the double curve thing and this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non issue . that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , it's our most marketable feature but can we really afford it if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . with voice recognition we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . and they said they wanted voice recognition . course , they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition we already have research backing voice recognition as fiscally solvent . but personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell that's what we need to go with we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , i'm thinking of the airport portal , like that little pod looking thing ? terracotta bowl although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , ","The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group.

ES2009d.A,"here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the industrial designer , or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with voice recognition , i_e_ that had a vaguely non remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold out bay for more advanced functions for users . the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , you provided a number that actually sounds quite the trouble is i was just given this by finance . it's a spreadsheet of the parts and i've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like if we can just itemize what's in here , it's a solar cell thing with a back up battery ? it's a speaker and a sensor at the same time and the case , it's more of a single curved case , and we've got a rubber skin material throughout . push button interface with this other drop down we've got two push button interfaces a bit over budget , what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back up battery . we can't remove the push buttons nor would changing the case materials . now we just go to the project evaluation this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , i got this slide from the coach and i'm not what it's connected to . guess we are going to discuss our project process this is the point where we go out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and forth and how that all worked ,  no , no whiteboard . was pretty tack though . attempts to contact coach ineffective . re it was like really creative actually , what did you guys think about the roles ? i did get i felt like i got way too into it . but you guys felt that you could keep the , suspension of disbelief like the role and the you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? no i , no i d i'm curious about what the de briefing is gonna be like . i'm not what the new ideas found i is about . that's the thing i got i in the email i got this powerpoint file i didn't change this one how much can you do with a remote control ? i we should go on a bit about the project eval , about you guys but i felt like a bit under stimulated on the whole thing . every single one i a all the presentations i either added slides or edited 'em . it seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . from the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , i don't really understood like the concept . we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , we did the project evaluation based on sarah's evaluation of on off switches and it's all recorded , i'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end i'll put all that into the final report as or as much as seems like will save this into the project documents . that's our last step . celebration . we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . we'll call that a doner .

ES2009d.B,"we have assembled our prototype , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here , d we decided those were the most important buttons . and then , for the more advanced functions there is a slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . and provides a very aesthetic when it's all put away , as far as the whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . worried about the materials , the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . and if you touch it does have that squishy feel . if you noticed , but i wrote the the company's name on the telephone screen , to put this into production , we're looking at about it was twelve fifty euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button even though it has a lot of modern technology , the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like it's not quite a face plate , it's more like a pseudo face plate it locks into place such that , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way and s you have to mark special colour and special form as it i it is very unconventional , we could take the battery out of it you see but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time and saying look my remote isn't working in the long run it's better to keep the battery , gotta do what you gotta do . i am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel are we considering these points here ? my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , it was pretty clever we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and filled in the gaps enough . at the same time you had enough room to just make things up , the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the powerpoint slides already put together for you if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . it was really good is there anything about the way that we got much inform what was it that kept us from going to the board ? and each time you get up it's a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . usually i would do a lot more doodling too definitely when i first filled out the questionnaire i was marking it probably higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed over it and then by the time i got to the last one i was like , not very much .

ES2009d.C,"we talked a quite a bit about the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here we call it fruity that's interchangeable and think it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there . that will work quite with regard to finding this contraption . if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . but that's that sums up the main features of our of the remote , did we come in under budget ? did we talk about the voice recognition option ? on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition console and think it's nicely designed into the overall look . but the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw come up with . and that has given a proven ease of use and what not . and allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user we didn't quite have enough material actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a new new plate on top of that . we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non natural look materials we also continued on with the ideas that f following apple's colour schemes with the the light orange and the green . the voice recognition area actually doubles as as the solar cell area . that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing that's what sets us apart and the reality is for me from an ideological stand point , i'd like to stick with the the solar cell , but i h have to throw myself in the business structure model here and that that we need to come to a compromise here and move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . that was a good compromise you brought forward sarah . they like that spongy feel . we didn't use the whiteboard also had i not been intrigued about the pen , i don't woulda used it i didn't write barely anything . n there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever what we wanted until the budget came down on us , the teamwork was good as when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing and then i also felt like lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end our jobs melded together a little bit more , and your leadership was quite good . what i woulda shown on that board . it's just like the paper i don't really needed the paper for . is this all we need to get through ? any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? think it was also realisation of you just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation you guys ready to celebrate ?

ES2010c.C,"looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of the remote , you have the scroll down , and then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the ipod . and it's like you have the both trendy and hip , but also very sleek and and very simple , but technologically advanced . there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as as by by sight . you have a specific triangular shape that you're looking at the up and down arrow . this is particularly geared towards children . and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the r_r_ , real reaction . but it's like just taking aspects out of that and saying , out of this one we like , the round section of b or we'd like the button size on this . let me just add one more thing that i couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , jill , i'm not exactly how it's gonna work , do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . it still fits in your hand , you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your hands are , because w and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r_r_ like that . i'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .

They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group then talked about the casing of the device, and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. The group also discussed energy source options and chips. "
ES2011d.A,"last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . for later in the meeting i've done a spreadsheet of production costs you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an excel spreadsheet . the only one that's in there , production costs . but if i missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed i said uncurved or flat . there's plastic for that area around the button . and lots of special colours actually . that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . we can do it separately and then discuss it i don't think thought it was the other way round . we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . i personally don't think this is comfortable to sit there , like it's an awkward position . we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . and you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and on that part . we're supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the thought we all worked very together . and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? my problem was , you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and what do you guys think of the pens ? mean we've all we all our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . guess we're supposed to write final reports . i don't know . or is that just me ?

ES2011d.B,"our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever . and the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . the locator is just chip that's inside there . and the beeper's also inside there too somewhere my impression was that flat meant like one of those square remotes . but it's really not very clear , it was the other way round too . some of these are not as easy to hold . we could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . it might also annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . i'm not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . mine was mostly made up they're kinda hard to write with though . and like the last thing i would have wanted would be to have to watch a video missed a meeting . there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . like if i missed a meeting i could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . i wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and all of us ?

ES2012b.A,"welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the last meeting we s we saw that the problems with existing remote controls were the a boring shape and boring colour . and we s we saw that the what we needed to do was to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , should have interchangeable fascias illuminated and that people might want it as in addition to their existing remote controls . and that it shouldn't be too small , that it gets lost . i'll shortly ask for three presentations . before i do that , however , i will go through some new project requirements that the management have placed on us the the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and the they don't necessarily agree with what we we thought . the n the new requirements are the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the the rise of the internet . and they want it only to cover televisions . what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , videos , d_v_d_s , satellite boxes , which mean we saw as being fundamental to the to the exercise . the the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . the logo being at b the bottom of the screen there , the two r_s in grey against yellow background . this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , but we need to talk that through . i must say that the c can't remember what phone service i was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked remarkably if people really don't use those buttons to any extent remove them altogether . i wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons if we went for voice recognition , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . forty no for forty five to fifty five age group , to put myself right in the middle of it , use remote controls to a great extent . again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . if we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . but if you just lift it up and say , channel one or b_b_c_ see technical problems with that in terms of the , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says i_t_v_ and you're watching b_b_c_ then it might change itself , it probably needs to be possibly actually need a button on it just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . w we need to s identify things that people actually need and it's a function of frequency and relevance . if we can design something that looks interesting , incorporates the logo and the colours and we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , buttons or buttons as an option . if we want to make this simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say do you want to just carry on with s we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it rather than the the traditional something like this shape , something that you can that's more vertical shape , l such as something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , again the n need to look at the technicalities of if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as i say , r know , really bite the bullets and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . and nothing else . your point about the big energy source is very valid one . don't suppose we've got any statistics on the life expectancy of remote controls , particularly independent ones . the number of things you buy these days , which have a lithium whatever battery in , perhaps we should have the disposable remote control , the battery will last know , five , ten years . perhaps we should , know , reduce the the moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment it's actually a marketing gimmick . it's it's practical . th think the idea of a rechargeable one is unless you're really high tech and it just recharges itself if it's n by , magnetic waves or whatever , what wh what do we think about the the permanent battery ? but there are certainly things that you buy . calculators the actual time that a remote control is actually operating i would think is i is probably , no more than minutes in its entire life . that does sound excessive . we're looking at extreme simplicity . we're looking at a radically different shape . possibly no buttons but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design , then that's fine . don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition and the only buttons that we need are channel control , volume control and on off .

The marketing expert presents, talking about user functionality requirements taken from research of 100 people. They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons, one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether, or one that combines the two functions.

ES2012b.A,"it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers . we are doing just the television . that's quite clear from the information that we've been given , we can all give some thought to that for the next meeting , ",They briefly review their discussions and close the meeting. 
ES2012b.B,"the only problem think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . i'll just do my presentation on the working design the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ player or whatever . and it does this by you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the the television , the d_v_d_ to tell that what to do . and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that's just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . what we need technically speaking for the remote control is some energy source , some user interface , which we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and sender and receiver . this is just little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . my personal preferences think we need sorta big energy source that won't die out , perhaps some rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , you wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . also definitely a user friendly interface and we've all mentioned adding a locating device on it , just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies . most of them , don't they have combination of the two , when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , we can do something like that ","They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons, one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether, or one that combines the two functions.

ES2012b.C,"was just gonna say like the flip phones that they use ? you could have the most used buttons on top and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , this is just about the technical functions . the method , i looked online for examples of other similar products and then just was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and then there are two different kinds that i found . there's a user centred one and an engineering centred one these are the two different ones . this one this is the user centred , it has quite a few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , what a remote control is you it's to send messages to the television set , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . and for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the logos for my personal preferences , this one is easier to use and has quite a fewer buttons . we want something that sends messages easily to the television and i was thinking if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier . the unique style , have it light up the changeable face plates , when we were talking about havi losing it , to have a button on the television that you press and it if it makes a noise or lights up like that , people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , do they make batteries that last that long ? they have that little solar are we doing just the television not d_v_d_ players , ","They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons, one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether, or one that combines the two functions.

ES2012b.D,"these are functionality requirements from the our guys down in the research lab . took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see . everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how often they're used and how much their necessary and and general opinions about current remotes . see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . i kinda take that to mean as they don't they , they only use they only work for the television as in my flat i've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a d_v_d_ player , a video player and t_v_ . again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but and we're going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used think fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , frustrations of like people losing remote control . some system of you press a button on the t_v_ it would have to incorporate , but like some system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . like it'll beep the time taken to learn new remote controls is and repetitive strain injury , i suppose we should make it more comfortable like i was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . don't even have to hold it as such . it also asked if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would . and there was another section on our on the report for l_c_d_ displays , but the data wasn't there , and it would cut out the r_s_i_ as if you possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . i've got some other things i couldn't fit onto this presentation . functionality , like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . like the power . using the d swi the power switch to switch on t_v_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most . i was possibly even thinking of a design that some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . like folding ledge that we can go into the channel settings and the audio settings , and keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath . you could just put it down once on top your t_v_ you were saying about it could technical problems of like someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could have like an activation i'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . i was just kinda wrapping up there . eighty percent of people would spend more on remote that looks better , take out the limited functio functions but as for channel settings and it might turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . it could have like know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . that sounds pretty good , like this this market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight ","The marketing expert presents, talking about user functionality requirements taken from research of 100 people.

ES2012c.A,"for coming to this third meeting of the design group . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and people lose them . that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that people use . we want to go for long lasting battery and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , a_ as trendy remote control , and b_ as real reaction product . again i'll we'll have the three presentations from the three of you and then we'll make a final decision . and the decisions that we need to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , and think our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for long lasting power supply , then it's sealed for life and this is where i need kate's expert advice do we go for a custom designed chip ? or do we buy one off the shelf and programme it ourselves ? we had some discussions last time as to how we might go forward and we'll finalise those da today . and thi this is all linked in with the user interface , and then f for the next meeting kate will be looking at the s the look , feel and design , kendra the ho how the user actually uses it and andrew the product evaluation . and kate and kendra will be producing a model for us to to look at . inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . do we know by how much ? and do we know how long it'll take to develop a custom chip . we need to make a decision here . given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . given that , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , given that the the technology is not developed and given that it's never been done before , perhaps we ought to stick to to buttons , it will have voice recognition the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're si simple , cheap and reliable . fair enough , fine . three there's three buttons on a slider . we have to come up with is the actual shape we're looking at sliders for both a volume and channel change that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . that's different , certainly . also means you can drop it without damaging it . it's like the old swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those , people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , a long time . but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it's even better . the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it y you've then got the connection whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that the whole thing is all , completely soldered together and , giving people the option of buying a new complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on it will still work then if , if people lose the cover , they might be inclined to go out and spend however many euros on a new one rather than a complete new re remote . it's up to our marketing people to ma turn it into a fashion item . and , as external fashions change , then we get new covers on the market and , readily available . it's the thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me . and th the design that i've got , and it could be a home made design , this says this is not just a television remote control , given that we've got one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and one slider and nothing else , we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . and , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and i don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but know the organic , curved look , t to deliberately get away from the the square look of most current remotes and , whether the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . there's certainly the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the corporate logo prominently my idea was something a b probably bit fatter than this but tha that sorta shape that you can just ho hold it . it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , and fiddling with the buttons . we d we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . we need the manual controls my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway i'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . if we if we're going down that route , then we need some display . we actually use the television , ","The project manager opens the meeting by recapping the discussions of the previous meeting, telling the group this meeting's agenda, and stating what each person will do for the next meeting. He also talks about batteries and chips. He talks about minimizing the clutter on the remote, and suggests using a slide button like on a mouse. The marketing expert presents, talking about trend-watching and how fruits and vegetables are currently an important theme.

ES2012c.A,"we've actually very conveniently just come to good point to s to sum up kate and kendra now go away and pa play with a bit of plasticine or play dough , and actually put what we've discussed into something was gonna say concrete , and andrew n can go away and th think about how we can actually market this as a concept and not j not just a simple remote control . for simplicity of , manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for a long term battery source and make an assumption that we can aim for a battery that will last most people for we'll say at least five ten years i interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept . it should be cheap , if we avoid any , electrical connections . i if we can come up with some way of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want , then mean this is new . we d we don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a good selection of covers that they can use anyway , they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to any of the famous supermarkets , no , because we've got few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant . cer certainly wider angle than current , that if you're holding it , anyway like you're likely to and it's i it will work most of the time i sorta envisaged that if this was the thing , then the whole of the top would be the the infrared we're all clear where we go from here . very much and i'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . ","Then they close the meeting. They discuss what the remote should look like in terms of shape color, and then talk about components, materials, and energy sources. "
ES2012c.B,"i'll just be talking about the components design . just looked at what exactly do remotes do . they for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the t_v_ . the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a connection within the remote the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a morse code format . this signal's sent to the transistor and then sends it on to the light emitting diode which is then trai changed into a infrared light as for how we should end up using this in our remote couple of main questions are the buttons . the fewer buttons you have , the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . however to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost effective way of producing it . also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the lifetime or the five to ten years we also need to look at the chips , custom designed versus off the shelf , and the custom designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have upon . however that's gonna cost more , but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation , if we were definitely gonna go with the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip . i don't actually have any price information , a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's the world the sky is your limit , they're about the same cost really . there's a lot of slide buttons out there . i've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , that can kinda tie into our changing face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , like that . that all c also encourages 'em to buy new covers that's just it with the covers , you're tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . that we should make the whole thing yellow yellow seems a bit of a strong colour you'd want it narrower than a mouse though it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . and then it widens up top you can still i incorporate the voice with less buttons . if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness but the television would be the display like you hit menu and menu will come up on television ","Then the industrial designer talks about the components design and explains exactly what remotes do and how they operate.

ES2012c.C,"does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , if you can pre programme in like numbers one through ten and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , i kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then we should have it for the whole thing . anyway , i'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . did some research on the internet the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices . findings , a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . there're some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a v_ in volume bring a little picture of what ours could look like . just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , have the slide button on the side , if i'm using a mouse i like to be able to slide it up and down thought it might be good for volume to just be able to roll it and then have the up and down the only advantage i was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , this is just the volume and this is the channel . i was thinking just for the volume , what if we included the batteries in the cover ? like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . i was kinda picturing like shape that's almost like a mouse . because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand we could make it a slightly different shape but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and little wider than this , and then it would have a l wider thing to have the light , the infrared light at the t_v_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up the top we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .

ES2012c.D,"we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . like the shape of it almost like a mouse , this is my report on trend watching . the data's come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . and we got reports from paris , milan on new fashions . and the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel . i was gonna say twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative side of it . and the third being easy to use is probably a given , from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . clothes , shoes and furniture and spongy material to be used on the outside . if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is the line we gotta be going through . but fashions do don't last very long . we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it depending on the cost of the product itself , could we have cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? instead of having a ten year guarantee ? with interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . the fashions apply to furniture , i'm just i'm suddenly realising that we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels are we starting to get away from the voice functionality of it ? we're leaving out the buttons for the f less frequently used but we could incorporate that into the voice . our energy source is gonna be and interchangeable case ? and are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or ","He also talks about batteries and chips.

The user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market, which the team later evaluated, and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and addressed the issue of what happens when remotes no longer operate.

ES2013b.C,"it definitely needs lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , existing examples , technical functions design . first off , do agree with what sarah has defined as your personal preferences,yeah . we need more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions the same as what existing remotes have . if we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something i'd thought about and i presume we can miss out the functions really to a video or d_v_d_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , satellite , cable , t_v_ remote control . these are two models of existing remote controls . the one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control . it has fast forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . it also has seems to have channel up and channel down , but we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , i don't think we need them we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . i was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user friendly buttons and menu that you can access . but then i do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility . but we could go back to the pictures of the what're they called ? the pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , the style of these is terrible . not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand held device , colours , just every e everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . that's that for now . it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass produced , although what suddenly came into my head is , how they always take two a_a_ batteries could it be possible to have like a rechargeable internal battery like an m_p_ three player does ? with that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . you could you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing a_a_ batteries , and it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . but then again i d i don't know if this is within our price range or not . but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long term use it'll be much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a_a_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer have its little dock that you could put it in . still i don't know if it's quite within our price range . that's probably more what it is . we're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , things like screen settings and audio settings , i would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . we didn't come to any decision on the functions though . is that the yellow and black ? i'll just use it from their website .

ES2013b.D,"one of the biggest issues i found about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls and that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . my main goal here is to re envision the remote control in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and that means we do need to make some decisions about what keys or buttons on the remote control to perhaps keep and what ones to discard . and if we devote some energy into this , the recent productions of real reaction , the i go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . an interesting element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . these market research questionnaires looked into your concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . i leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this if and the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , i don't know if speech recognition should be should be included , that shows more about being open to technology . i did not receive any information on that , but the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very important , because there is a question about do you want an l_c_d_ screen and that wasn't responded to , but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , but the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and i'm making the leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than older people . or comfortable , the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is up to the designers . do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . it's better than my idea about solar , probably . but you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? it might be good to know who , who's actually buying televisions i have a chart here that i didn't include . my only comment is we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . if you're pressing enter , the thing would already be on , and when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter i was thinking you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , that has a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . it's definitely channel , volume , power . could you reiterate the new project requirements , ","The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of remote controls and the increasing interest among younger consumers in speech recognition.

ES2013c.A,"this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . and we should each have a presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . sarah , you presented a marketing research report which rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . and then steph did a second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use . kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass produced device , because of the twelve and a half pence cost . but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . we that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v_ , and that the function we was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand held . at that point we that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what do the current ones sell for . and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . it sounds like the covers that they use for the remote , your t your cell phone . perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management we need to come up with some specifics of the components , the materials , things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things . they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we've discussed were battery , kinetic or solar . you were saying that the kinetic would be useful , as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries . or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . what's the feelings of the group on the kinetic ? the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's possible .  the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . what about the case ? they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and we've discussed not having titanium . we've eliminated wood . we said plastic or rubber . the next part they want is the user interface concept . this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . and they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , marketing they want product evaluation . the look and feel design is for kate , steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . the two of you get to play with a pla modelling clay to do a prototype . and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . and that's the end of this meeting .

ES2013c.B,"we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . spongy is gonna be difficult , i'm afraid . we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , i was thinking titanium myself . w would it be helpful if described the components a bit , you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you , i've been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , this is the innards of a remote control and that's the back of the interface . and this is a push button one , you see these little buttons here , they're little rubber buttons that go through onto the board at the back and they push these buttons here . that's the basic construction that we've got to accommodate . we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the message to the receiver . first of all wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . we can have your bog standard double a_ batteries in a replaceable little compartment . we can have a hand a wind up , but i it is doesn't quite go with the the fruit and veg . one that is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where you actually get the energy by moving the device , or we had talked about solar power , but i thing that we that's not good in the dark . i'm afraid this is the options we've got on the case . it can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there is rubber , and it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . what does the interface look like ? push button , that's the one we're all familiar with . we can have scroll buttons and the scroll button can incorporate a push , you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel like that and push to select something . you can have multiple scroll buttons , and we can also incorporate an l_c_d_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've got three , simple , regular , advanced , if we want the cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices . i don't that is , but they think it's quite important we've got two options . we can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , it , won't necessarily l look like a pineapple , but it could have an l_c_d_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker . i'm afraid i don't have that information available . manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i'm afraid . we could do double curved rubber one , which would allow say a banana , but unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , i'd certainly support that idea . we can't have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . and the having the screen on the television screen is a good idea , do you want scroll buttons in that as that's a g clean design , but we can implement it with simple push buttons , we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy unfortunately i don't have costing information . i in terms of workability , the two front runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , chip on print is just a manufacturing technique and i would certainly recommend it , i'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but i agree , it's sounds like a idea if it is .

ES2013c.C,"and as for budgeting as if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . i have been influenced by pictures of ipods , possibly it might be more useful if kate went next . what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . i don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company . that's before i heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit wise . i don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says , just that my method was to look at the , my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar thing , including m_p_ three players , like hi fi remotes , not just television and these things . having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . it has scroll wheels without a display , was thinking that really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , you can scroll along and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . but i'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really and fun and good to hold and big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . what seems ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , not fancy but not minimalist , just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen just small along the bottom and and i definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber . titanium would be great , but it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . if we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then titanium's too futuristic . whereas a plastic's cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the picture of the kiddie one . and i quite like it , it's just smooth and hand held and it's got these easily reachable buttons something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a circle . up , down , left , right . i was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . and enter in the middle , and when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . but they all have this feature of this it's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a selection in this circle , either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . just something else i need to bring to your attention this is actually the volume up and down , but they both say v_ on them , we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . but we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . if we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . i've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . a good selling point . but it does depend how much how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . do you not think it might need like a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a spongy s thick spongy cover , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . i'd like push buttons with ","The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design.

ES2013c.D,"first thing i want to address is one of the points that florence brought up , which was current cost of the competition devices , and they're twenty to sixty euros , depending on branding . but that with the current price that we're searching for , we're within , even on the lower end , of the of the market . i investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my the theme of what i was to work on was trend watch . what's hot , fruit and veg . spongy . and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . this is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , and if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing . fancy . functional is out . and f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , i'm thinking polished , elegant , innovative , but a cut above . this is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . this is interesting , think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being important , but what's innovative is having it simple with with technologically superior fabrics or designed in interesting substances . ease of use . again , pretty low , it's the top three , but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit themed sleeves . i was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned , something similar to a summer dress . it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . initially we could start with fruit that would suit long hand held , banana , pineapple and pear . they could be interchangeable , they're spongy , what we're talking about is changing . this concept . everyone has a t_v_ remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , i'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . really open this up to any other feedback . this spongy fruit and veg . many of us would associate those with fancy . it would be very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . i was really thinking a lot about the i_ the imac gel gem tone . do you have any idea if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ? it seems that you guys are quite keen on the plastic , do you think we could put it in a fruit colour ? and have it abstract . we could call like a fruit name , i'm thinking we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are i've used kinetic in terms of watches you don't even notice that it's there . then i'll just say i support either from a marketing point of view i support either decision that the designers make on that .

ES2016b.B,"gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors which is what dictates the design the both the interface and the outer appearance i'm going to do a lot of the on the board . this is the basic premise of a remote control . the basic function is to send messages to another system . an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits . there's also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more used system . a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . what we have is different components that need to go in there . we'll start with an energy source . which is usually a battery this energy source is connected to the user interface itself . which can be buttons , whatever , which controls a chip . the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . and that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . the way you normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as that that it's working the energy source for one thing can be altered . what we probably cannot alter is the infrared , the sending device the infrared lamp . we cannot change the chip the user interface . that's something we can also discuss . as we've heard speech recognition is the hype in the moment . or if we just do the usual button thing . or we have a touch pad like that and the energy source . batteries . solar cells . it's always a question whether these components are available cheap enough , developed enough . talking of which scrolling function is not too bad . would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . then you hold it in your hand like this . and you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the side . you can also have it , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . causes a problem for left or right handed people actually . then there's another point of making it a two in one thing . if we have a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . you give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . like your zap zapping device is just u channels up down , volume , and on off . means the big one has to be sufficiently big . and perhaps heavy , ","The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and then the team discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design.

ES2016b.C,"having just listened to what corinne just said , i'll draw on some of the things as some things that relevant to what i wanna say . i'm just gonna approach the technical functions design . the method i used was to explore the technical functions of a remote control . and t s simplest approach that i came to is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . had some things sent to me . not very much . to look at similar devices . we discussed a universal one . but universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within the budget that we do it , because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . you have to set them , reset them to everything . and that would only add buttons . whereas the aim is to take away buttons . think it'd be better to concentrate on just a universal one for t_v_s . here's just two pictures of remote controls . but one is user centred . and you can straight away see there's less buttons . and the other one is engineer centred where that's more specified for the the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control and on what the have said and the market research and probably looking at something that should be user centred . fewer buttons , simpler to use , the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden some remote controls you might have come across have little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . our product should be user interface orientated . like i said to concentrate on t_v_ remote control , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work . sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone . and you need to take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as i did have a thought about the the tracking thing . if it came with holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . but if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sends out a beep to find where it is just by infrared . i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one handed . the ball is probably not a good idea . i don't know if that might cope with like the trend watching . it might be to look at the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . the bigger ones they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . on a side view . something that it would fit in the hand better . instantly always going for the right handed person . i'm just thinking if it was circular with the that the early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , ","The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote, presented two differently designed remotes available on the market, and described some features a user-centered remote should include.

ES2016b.D,"this is my report , which is going to be based on a survey first of all , the method that i used was by doing some marketing research , by doing research on some interviews that were conducted . and then some internet research . there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . and will show you some of the results from that , they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . that's definitely important . seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . and if anyone could clarify what that means ? zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . and some of them it looks like barely need to be included channel selection is used the most frequently . and then teletext was the next . volume and then power . and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r_s_i_ . as far as speech recognition goes , the younger group looks like they're all for it . from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . and it just went down incrementally . we could discuss this and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . at least if we're targeting the younger groups . in conclusion . some things that i drew from this are that we were correct . we definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . and then lastly that we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . i don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old but by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . power . you could buy like a special left handed version of the remote . special order .

ES2016c.B,"the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , its job is to for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television . we are talking this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . we are talking something more complicated it's going to be more expensive as we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . can also mix these . what we could use is , or what i was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . solar cell is interesting . may fail though , every here and there . the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem . you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it starts to work . i'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery . our interface options are push buttons . however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d_ into the remote control as if we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set up that we that i've just presented , the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control . with the titanium we cannot make it a curved design . with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . with rubber we could sh shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an l_c_d_ screen . how about affecting the surface of the actual remote control ? say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape but give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . we can still design a two piece remote without having a base , having one of them be a base station , when it comes to the chip on print , as i said , the more advanced features you want , the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive .

The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added. The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy. The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget. The costs were over budget, so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget.

IS1000b.A,"i c talk about it but i have no slides or anything . i've just been presented with some research we've done in a small focus group a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . i've just got a web page with some data on it . it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . i have an a web page yes . there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour . channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . and thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . i don't know how we'd go about combating that . and then it's got a demographic breakdown should be able to actually , if i email it to you now . one thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in a remote control . and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . that would not work you wanna have both options . this is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , which we'll be talking about later another thing it's talking about there is the l_c_d_ screen but there's no figures on that . how would that work ? is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the t_v_ or use the v_c_r_ ? but i don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . but taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , that's the the new and the funky things , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , how much longer have we got for the meeting we haven't talked about demographic we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? it's only a low market , it's a cheap end remote control , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it they're not just going to buy a new remote control just it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as but if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . i've got friends who've got many things they need a universal remote , we can't , with the price range . we're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product . if we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to l_c_d_ screens and things like that but if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t_v_s to use a remote control on . i don't know really what the price range for remote controls is . are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , what i'd like from a universal remote is choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , v_c_r_ and t_v_ . and just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .

IS1000c.A,"this is just a presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it people wanna buy it . we used some focus group surveys and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . the most important by far was the look and feel of it . it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want . that's a really feature , third on the list , innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use . they have to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables this is talking about just the feel of it , probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really spongy is the current thing . spongy is the current texture , but there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile if we make it like furry or soft that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , makes it stand out , the oranges and the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , a lot of them have the changeable covers , they can choose what colour the outside is . textured feel we just talked about . if it's part of the changeable covers then may they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one like that . still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , there are other aspects like l_c_d_ screens and speech recognition which weren't i don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . we're better doing something basic like this and very will be a really feature to put in . we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top by themselves , and then th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like b_b_c_ , rather than having to remember the number of it on the keypad . ten channels , at the most . but a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a small vocabulary . you can have it it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , either having the buttons you can feel the difference between them or if they light up we need specific costings then . do two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . one i've had before , a r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , can we think about having a non recta non rectangular one , with not just the straight little box we might be out of time for this meeting . is there anything else i need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? is this me designing a way to evaluate it ","Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends. She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting, contain a cool feature, and be somewhat intuitive. She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors, bold designs, and a spongy feel is appropriate. She lists ideas such as changable covers, a locator, speech recognition, and LCD screens. He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote. The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms. The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process, listing options such as various buttons, scroll wheels, integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse, and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip. They decide to make two designs, one more advanced than the other. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting. "
IS1000c.B,"i suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . i hope you both did some some work concerning a conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . we have some forty minutes to complete this do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? there is matthew . yes the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand i don't know whether my superiors would be glad with it because you have to introduce a complete new l line of of supplies it would be very complicated organisational those covers could go for three , five euro . because i'm not whether that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents . i'm to have every time i have to come down on this price again this might be a little limiting for your creativity , do we think these ideas an and my sp speech recognition , it's possible for twelve euro but then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the the furry case of the m we can give the the case a very normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , a wooden case . we should come to some decisions now about this . i understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , can we use same chip , with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features . when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is possible in the given budget , we should go for the more expensive chip , wh when you make a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . think we can just use more cheap plastic for a basic edition , let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . we now can concentrate on the basic remote control . it's possible i don't know whether you can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much . ju just make two designs , and the we can decide between th those designs . i don't know whether that's possible , you can start evaluating their work somehow . i don't know whether that's possible in the given time but a as far as possible . you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes and further instructions will be will be sent to you by by email . let's call this to an end .

IS1000c.C,"then the idea of having a remote is generally you have different keys and different structures , different forms , and they could be like buttons and they could be of varying sizes if you want to emphasize a particular key more than the other , and like you can have different colours having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . what i have found was that currently the they are mostly that the t_v_ , v_c_r_ , music system operated ones actually , if you want to follow the v_c_r_ and if you want to follow the s some soundtrack on the w see they have the common thing actually you can have there is also speech recognition to store channel information , names , if you have a multiple functionality , say t_v_ , v_c_r_ say it to the t_v_ and the t_v_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v exact channel numbers ex exactly , in the present market i saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . like the remote with l_c_d_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities you are watching a movie , and you are having a universal remote control and you want to you don't know really which functionality is now , use a simple toggle switch , and a display , press it the display says , i'm in t_v_ or d_v_d_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote that they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . i personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . i got a mail from the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi joe , like that , it's a limited vocabulary thing , and very isolated word and it's it is interesting , and storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing and having something like a blinking thing , like it could indicate you're it could indicate what is cal like the whether you have enough battery in your remote , the blinking . at the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also you can let them to do that . it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , you really need a some indicator , it could be a blinking option of l_e_d_ like if you have an l_c_d_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which need just six volt th three volts of d_c_ . you may need to check your battery usage and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . and then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something wanted to know like if you want to have a fo if you want to have the l_c_d_ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys how f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . i don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro like what will be the each individually the cost of it . it's it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . it will be much ch much expensive we can give them smooth keys , the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , as i was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition like that . one for like cost and the one with like higher end that then we can be easily comparing them ","The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms.

IS1000c.D,"the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? that's a very good idea , y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? some of them ? and isn't that too difficult i don't know if we still want the r_c_ to be easy to use , i would say that for programming keys , you said , it could be easily done within the package of twel twelve euros , i if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , and w how much it's cost , with a f cheap chip . what i'm gonna present here is very basic knowledge about the all the components that are inside a r_c_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . there is a set of components in a remote control the components in themself do not cost a lot there are two different types of two different ways of using the components for making a remote control . the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some transistors with an that aims at communicating the message and to send the message to the to the led that will transmit to the receiver . the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as with a different sequence for each key , electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . for our design we want some b programmable v_ v_l_s_i_ or f_p_g_a_ high technology , and also we'll use like in any high tech devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . my personal design we need to find a solution what what is the material of the cover we want to use . if it's plastic they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . and very cheap l_c_d_s , liquid crystal displays , i'm wondering , we might be able to integrate l_c_d_ into our r_c_ . and the final point is we have there are some compromise to do . we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel and that higher high tech needs more money which is a higher price range and the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but with twelve euros and if it's made for four million items , then we could be able to handle that . and for the designing of the cove cover layout then it's better to see that with the u_r_ exp u_r_i_ expert that we can it's really a team working it's simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . we could insert one that could underlie several functions exactly that's a very good idea , both if we had a budget of twenty euros , it will be but i it's a detailed plastic versus wood , and we need to centre our description on the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user , and with graphs or i don't know and not too m too many keys we need to also to make a decision on how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or ","Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends.

IS1000d.A,"we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . it's outside the budget then . that's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition . i like the shape of them , i do like the size and the shape . and we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . it's just a shortlist of criteria on the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , these are the things we identified as being important . the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . and then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as do you wanna go through and put through those on the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? just go through onto the whiteboard the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? look and feel , innovation you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ? one's bad and seven's the best . one's true and seven's false . on the scale u it's between functional and fancy we're looking at , isn't it the ink ? it's lost a battery . because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , but it wouldn't be picked up on the actual whiteboard . and the other one ? it's slightly better , the other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , it won't work i'd say two or three for that one , personally . it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . are we including like a location thing like trying to find it ? but th is there any there's no actual innovation in that i'd be up for seven for innovation . th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . innovation for this one is two ? one ? the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it , ease of use ? that's two for ease of use . three or a four . how it goes to the target demographic . we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? sh completely changed our demographic there , if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then imagine it being applying to the demographic we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , there's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one . and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? it's got the toys in it , it's got the l_c_d_ screen especially if we're gonna n have an l_c_d_ screen on a low range product then that's good . i'd probably go with three again for that one . and especially this has the speech recognition as and that makes it more appealing , the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . as it is , not really doing either of them . the spongy could be part of the feel of the buttons as have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons but i'm thinking one of the nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons that feels kinda spongy . but that's if you're using the covers . they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . you got the option of having different colours or different textures . the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics , even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . that's the feature that could be included in either of them . although it is more with the spongy buttons on the on the other one . the average of that is three six nine divided by five , five nine by five , one point s eight ? but we still got a very different price for those two they're not really comparable yet anyway . it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . that'll take us down to the budget . now we're either going button or l_c_d_s , l_c_d_ display . it would need twelve buttons . and that's without any special button supplements . we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as that's what we've got those the scroll wheel on the side we've got a scroll wheel for the volume this is even more than the than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros . but that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds on , without special colours or form or material . the l_c_d_ display is three francs , three euros , by itself .

IS1000d.D,"now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . you can go up and down the channels , if you have a video you can forward , back . this is a standard t_v_ one , and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . the extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel . and the other one is for the teletext you want to browse through from that . actually . it's a very basic minimal thing it is a very futuristic , it's like it's like a brain machine interface and all this we are thinking about in the future , it can come . then the this is the a more a little smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , in this way , th you see there are only six keys , they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . and they have more space actually and it's easy to use this and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have channel up and down and slow pause or s slow lo pause or stop , you have a l_c_d_ display , here and this is a functional thing which can change it's a toggle switch which could change the function you can have a integrated microphone over here , you want to do a speech recognition and that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the on your display . and here is a small l_e_d_ which tells you like are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier then we have a cover when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality  actually when you are watching the t_v_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , and this gives a protection to the l_c_d_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . gives a protection sixteen euros . three euros . if you have new more ideas we can add new more some more keys it should not be cluttering up everything . and now it easy to use . the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say but still i will give four in that case c can you get the batteries ? actually this is not going to protrude actually , which 'll be covering in a curve because right if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . no but except for the design of the surf . it's more of the feel . though it has more functionality actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , i would give this model to the old people actually . but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . in that case it's fine then . two because you can add lot of sophistication on that . we we it's the way they are going to be , actually . think it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , one point eight four point four point two . we ought to reconsider everything with this , you might use a a_a_ battery actually . are you talking about this or that ? we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? that is the sample sensor and sample speaker . we just need that actually . we need one . or we could even replace them by buttons actually . a actually it depends , it depends what functionalities you want to add into it , if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have l_c_d_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two euros at least . we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons . ","After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes, beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce. It contains an on-off button, volume switch, up/down channel function, 10 digits, and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function. The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone, has 6 keys, and is smooth. It also has a power button, channel up/down, slow pause/slow stop, LCD screen, toggle switch that changes it from audio to video, and microphone. It would cost 16 Euros to produce, which is out of the budget.

IS1001a.A,"welcome everyone . we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing a new remote control . will first start with a warm welcome opening then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . the goal is to have a remote control to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user friendly . the design step will be divided in three main points . first it will be the functional design . third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . and then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and like that . and then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point . will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to each of us to draw your favourite animal on the white board . your animal is recorded it's not lost . draw like a very simplified cow . here the financial objective of our project . that is to say to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of fifty million euros . if it's trendy , original i d fulfil the user needs . we have to decide if it can control one device or multiple . have the your opinion from the marketing side ? if it selled by its own i it would rather be for multiple device . and do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirement we should fulfil ? and do you have it also to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? fit in your hand , water proof as water proof would be very original . but we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof as we can sell all that together , plastic protection and and a waterproof box as we can have something you whistle and the remote control beep . that's a good idea , that's very original and that's can improve . we have to ask the quest of that's design to the industrial designer . try to find that for next meeting . will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design any working function we have discussed . then i will ask the user interf interface designer to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . and also will ask the market expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is needed in a remote control for the user . and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon . that's all for this point . ","The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals. They discussed making the remote able to control multiple devices, protection from water or from dropping the remote, and a locator function. The group discussed several of their initial ideas for the features of the product. The Project Manager then instructed the User Interface Designer to research users' requirements, and instructed the Industrial and User Interface Designers to research the functions and usability features that were discussed in the meeting.

IS1001b.A,"we are here for the functional design meeting i will take notes during this meeting i will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards then each of you will lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time we have a technical problem short cut to ami shared folder ? you can send it to me by email . i will try to show it to everyone , but we it seems that we are going to make a t_v_ remote control according to new requirements i received from the management you we have to make it more ergonomic to have l_c_d_ and voice . because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on t_v_ more where it seems that the market is more important . if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost it will add serious competitive advantage we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and like that anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's not used any more by users , and then also we have to make very clear that this this remote control is part of our products and show our corporate logo and colours on the design as that they identify it as one of our product . before finishing we can define what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control from the marketing expert key aspect is the easy to use aspect , few buttons , channel , volume control switch t_v_ on and off we can include that also . previous channel button . because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . have a wheel for incremental , have the digits on the lower side that can be closed i would say the wheel is better . it should be lightening in the dark because most people lost their remote control . and do we put an l_c_d_ display ? no l_c_d_ ? and no speech as because it w it would delay too much the development process that would be but eight months is really long we will move to next meeting in after the lunch break and i will make a summary of that meeting that i will put in the shared folder you can't see for next meeting send me your presentation before by email that we can see them altogether . ","The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions. She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens. The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints. "
IS1001b.B,"the question first of all what to control . most people want to have a remote for their hi fi and t_v_ and like that . and other people also want to have remotes for controlling whole house . there's a project called x_ house like that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers the finder feature by whistling or whatever . if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want the user interface will consist of two parts . and th the buttons part would be set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . like a video tape goes forward , backwards , fast and for special navigation you might have a t_v_ in the menu and you going to change and also parameter changing . if there are common parameters we should put special buttons for that or we could have everything generic voice command w we could specify anything . we could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . how much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . how should they how should we implement that ? because could be numerical only or could be also incremental . there is are some with a wheel like this . instead of having the up down buttons for you can have the wheel . if you do not multi function then there is no p point in having l_c_d_ . just increase the cost . ","The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible.

IS1001c.B,"you just have a very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a wheel control . the push button are usually extremely cheap , but have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . and we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if we could combine something with the push button . wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a push button . we should talk about the design of the box also which needs some money . the want to mention the problem of the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , we have already some good things with with the backlight of the push button . as soon as you thought to move the remote control you have the light . i don't think that this is really expensive , a little bit . and for look and feel , what about a piece of ice , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , we will just use a standard battery ? chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . want to have something to prin to fix my components onto that box , and that's it .

IS1002b.A,"we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that i forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations . we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . did you all receive that email ? does anyone have any overall tha that first point could also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that's presented , but we are being dictated that this should only be for the television . we're quite fixed . we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . we really have to innovate here that the last point is probably quite straightforward . the w it has to be branded . can you handle that black and yellow ? we have three presentations , and we'll go in order of participant number here . we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . do we have an idea of costs of different components ? but i t what the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . still think if it's cheap enough functionality wise to include , it really should be in there . even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as i understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , what we're getting into here is the idea of internet through the t_v_ there is a on digital t_v_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and there's other features on other systems where you can pause live t_v_ and things like that . they're just features from the internet from computers are coming into the t_v_ under the covers , if it's , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an button like that might do as in future proofing it . and neither do i a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . if we're keeping it basic we're loo what we're looking to sell it is it's just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that thing . but i if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty five euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard t_v_ but we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing presentation about this . does any of the the features that pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? onto participant four . now the question is can we make this for less than twelve fifty per ? we do we necessarily have to change the end cost because can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve fifty per product , if we can sell more based on this ? we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . i th it's important to remember that this remote has to work with multiple t_v_s , it's selling on its own . all you need to do is train them to the individual one , we really can't chase that . we're really looking for something basic . the one thing that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , where i'd be inclined to go back to upper level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . we're trying to get mind share about real reaction to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind share by either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable priced , and solid . is twenty five euros a mid market price for a remote ? i'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . if we can take it down to fifteen rather than twenty five and make a low profit margin on it , and communicate this to the more senior people within the company here to get a reaction . i w i don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . it i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one t_v_ user . but it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent .

The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project, again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor.

IS1002b.B,"one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . think our our target here is to have some very like sleek look remote but one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like this thing here . we want something that looks and it's fashionable and i'm the industrial designer . and we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need , just every remote'll need 'em . we need some kinda of power d power source . we have to decide on our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . we need a programmable digital signal processor to to take the input from the user and translate that into into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra red l_e_d_ , which you aim at the television which and it receives that signal . you need a on off switch and we also need to have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t_v_s . we need to know all the different all the different signals and that'll require some memory as here's just a basic layout of how the remote would work . you ha the v the power source is in the upper right hand corner there , and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra red l_e_d_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo transistor . this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w are gonna be necessary f to have a working remote . we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , that you can kinda say would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . the most costly components are gonna be the chip the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as the l_e_d_ and the transistors and everything else are they're pretty cheap . depending on what we want our functionality to be , the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and like that and h how much power . we we have to until we get to a more specific design phase for that . but and significant part of the cost could be the actual casing itself and the b the buttons and things like that , that's all i have really . i it's just the cost of an extra button . if it's possible you should try to have a talk with management about that . i'm just thinking with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people actually use every feature like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , it's just confusing to do to use all these functions . where the largest portion of the market is just gonna they lost their t_v_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their t_v_ . they want something that looks that that it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , market share . the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our profits . because as we add costs for things like for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , what percentage of the of the market is actually gonna use that ? all these things are pretty standard . and it's along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even address the issue of losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . what we can do is , that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . right ? not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? like a cradle that is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . it's a good opportunity for the user design you could have some neat little , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . and you could page the remote if you lose it . what do is look into ho pedro and look into how much this might increase our costs don't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that level we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , the d_v_d_ player and , the stereo system and all that . which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . but i do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . our market niche is people who need who have lost their remote and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . if you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . we need to , have a few designs to look at ","The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation.

IS1002b.B,"what's really important is it has to look good , it has to be durable , it has to a and it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . or what if it looks like a pen ? un unless you guys are die hard against the fact that it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . because i really in a certain sense it almost like for me i would want to have that just , because i know at the end of when i'm done watching t_v_ that when i'm done , better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . the locator'll definitely be more expensive . one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery .

IS1002b.C,"we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t_v_ that we people use our remote with . it's stupid decision . then the double r_ will be our function design . what i found is we want to do fashion and honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple and try to aim for design . if case will cost the same if it looks good or bad we ma we have to make it look good . something cute and small . the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . and although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for that have loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , tune in their the stations . there's no need to have that in the remote . as for what i would recommend for the interface design , and will change the colours on the logo , but we should go for the user oriented device , simple controls and good ergonomics . and although i th i'm still here recommending the teletext i'll remove that , the they're aiming at saying that you would use couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and like that but i still think teletext is way more convenient until we have the same commodities . and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and but we can remove it but we're not putting some there's no putting anything in the place of teletext . just i would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . as for , the case design i'll come up with more concrete ideas . right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small but we th that should be design . technology we'd we're not in the price range to do it . we should aim at design . we should keep it simple , medium low cost mar cost area and make it look good .

IS1002b.D,"what comes up for me is that if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than right . no , i agree with you . what i'm talking about is i see that one side we're eliminating something we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta ta . somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy it took they can't ac access their teletext . we're talking about eighty percent or ninety five percent of the televisions out there are teletext . it's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? we're talking about existing technology . i in the very beginning it said with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out moded teletext . i don't understand how those two things are connected . how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? don't see the cross over between computers and television . do see the cross over in some sense , but with the remote is used for television , i don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , and we're also marketing a product . it's what i'm seeing is a mid range cost product . we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing and to me if i'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for design i'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . i want to market it as exclusive . would market this product it at eighty nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design th but i don't think we have that flexibility . and if i'm coming in with a with twenty five euros , which is mid market price , then what am i going to give these people for this ? pedro , want to say quickly i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , sell things come to my mind is something that's voice activated . and of voice activated of how many times i've lost my remote and i can't find it . some way that find my remote by clapping my hands our competition out there has got these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their v_c_r_s , their d_v_d_s , their televisions and to me we have to make this a really special product but i don't see the market niche for this product without some really something really special to identify it as unique in the market . that's up to you then 'til you spoke and when i wrote this , i don't i'm marketing . know that i was identified as a we identified ourselves as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a distributor t to other wholesalers . and the th the twenty five euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . what i did is i decided that this needs to be a product in a sense can market itself . we're making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is . would like to have a product that we can sell easily . having something beauty , something attractive , something that in a sense will sell itself . innovation fits into what we're talking about here with design . cutting edge technology , i don't think we're gonna have that , unless we come up with some new age product a as far as the casing is concerned . i talked about environmentally sensitive , we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . wanted to talk about who we are as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . to me it's about selling d our identity our corporate identity along with the product . we're in the middle of the market , but again , because what i see is budget restrictions and limitations , i don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . i like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double . no . no , we have t we have to change the end cost . i my reaction is no , but see i see i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high tech design , ergonomics , all of this . they gave us a fundament a foundation of what they want , and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . i don't role we have in this in the corporate ladder do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and then discuss ?

IS1002c.B,"here's a look inside your really old looking remote control . you've got a printed circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate you've also got you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . you've got here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , you've got the l_e_d_ here on the end of the on the end of the printed circuit board . you've got a couple diodes here for i don't know who and whatnot . we've got a i in this drawing he in this example here , this is a eighteen pin chip it's two double a_ batteries . this is pretty standard remote . here are options for our power sources . you can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some hand dynamo where you crank it like that . that's the next bullet is the the kinetic provision of energy , it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it . we've got solar cells , which i don't think is a very good idea because you could not use your remote at night and finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . it is more mean it is more eco friendly than the cradle we have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . our material choices are a plastic latex ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , wood , or titanium . if we go with titanium we're gonna be limited in the amount of shapes we can do i can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , my recommendation personally would be to do some plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it to mak like a thick plastic inner shell and a t to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we'll have a lot more options just in terms of shape but these are curved and double curved i believe that the tech department , in their in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . i have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double curved . curved means just curved in one axis and double curved is curved in two axes with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and l_c_d_ display , or multiple scrolling wheels . these are all options that the user interface guy can has at his disposal to put together a user interface . for electronics , we have these very technical descriptions here . a simple chip , which is the least expensive , but i have no numbers to give you , a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense a simple chip is required to operate push buttons . an advanced chip is required to operate the l_c_d_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but i have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . that's the end of my presentation . it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel . then why don't you just press the up button ? even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the t_v_ . it's a bad idea frankly . are you talking about the picture ? that's not our b design , right the two big th points that we have far are the having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell with a plastic interior , my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales it's worth it to do it , but would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . no we can do multiple scroll wheels but i'm thinking something like kinda almost like these pens , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . or from my perspective l_c_d_ is a mistake and all you're doing it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last we have to for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . dunno about like the flip phone idea , the locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s i would imagine . the scroll wheel , in or out ? for me the scroll wheel actually might not be bad . i don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , now just though you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of t_v_s won't re the t_v_s won't respond exactly the same . you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip . it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , ","The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device.

IS1007a.B,"b did you send us an email about this ? each of us has a role to do . we already have our role . there are three kinds of designs , that's all . i'm doing the interface . working on i . user interface . see there's a role for everybody . what is the most important function aspect ? it should be easy to work with . we you can have a speech recognition interface . you just tell the television i want which channel . or you can say want to list all the programme tonight . just say want to press i wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . instead of pressing the channel number , i am choosing the programmes directly . the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but and it's more natural . but th the main idea i wanted to s i wanted to say is that there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch t_v_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either t_v_ channels or pr or the contain or the contents of the programme . because you see now all the t_v_ programmes are available on the webs . we just want to retrieve the content we can just use the service available . and then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . the most there are only seven buttons . just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , to choose among the sorted list the programme you want , you don't have to display here , just display on the t_v_ screen , right ? because all the t_v_ the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons we have sometimes to use the white board . but we are designing just remote control . do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . right ? first one is to buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . to choose content s or channels . technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . we will get some information in the next meeting , we will get information and then we'll come back in .

IS1007b.C,"right , will talk about the w working design and and will present my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve what we want to do . i'll do a survey about what is what is available on the market and what is the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . then will try with the technical team to build a prototype and how an and we can start troubleshooting first com communication problems or things like that . and when we are ready with this first prototype we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or things like that . wha what for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired think we u we can use a battery for the . then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . and the communication with the t_v_ set is made through infrared communication this is the schema of the o of the future remote controls you can see the components , battery and the two chips goes to the infrared connection to the t_v_ set . the one on top is for the the functionali the functionalities and the th red the green one is to putting things together , transform the data into qu into the format to to communicate with the t_v_ set . we should use a f_p_g_a_ for the functionalities which is easy to t f_p_g_a_ is just a chip you can you can pr programme it wi with wh whatever you want . and the bluetooth chip is just responsible to make the communication between the two devices . th the f_p_g_a_ will produce the data to send . we have to have embedded batteries in the and don't think it will need very much power to make it run , it's a good idea . also , but the goal is to sell our remote control . we have to sell a t_v_ with the remote control too . there is al there is a technology like show view who is already available on most of the t_v_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to do the processing on the remote control because yes , that's a good idea , we d we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on the t_v_ f four five buttons , it's sufficient . it's easy to build , it does not consume much power . then y you go to the main menu and you have go to channel but if you want to make big jump but you have to have a device when you could but something that says more clearly that right , left , up , down , the to have the ability to write something to the navigator , directly , or we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to make a speech recognisers runs on the small ts and this can allow to choose the program , without adding buttons s speech is a important extra feature we just have to find a mean how to add a m a microphone or yes a microphone into the remote control , but what about the new project's requirement ? we should give up with teletext , no ? we can j we can already think about a way to access the internet via the television . but we can think that in a few years there will be t_v_ set that can access the internet . it's a good idea if i if we think about how to build up our remote control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . not to implement it , but to to find a way to add this functionality in a in an easy manner , if is possible .

IS1007b.D,"one is a communication . it's a field programmable gateway arrays . or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? and the second one is for the software . and how about the battery power ? that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . we just make a small charger we do not want to make it p_d_a_ . but you have a catch there , assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . just give it a name and we call him . after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , most of the points which i want to are already covered here . and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that these are the findings which we got and adding of a speech interface is always good for a t_v_ remote we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . it's not going to take much space also . it's going to be very slim . and next one was the size of the remote control . it has to be very slim and small one . and most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , we have to look for a trade off . the features and the cost . little bit more if it's with extra features . for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . as discussed in the earlier meeting , but not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . as i discussed th that four points would be good for marketing . the speech interface and less reasonable cost . and the lighting adaptation and the teletext . and regarding the teletext these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . if you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . and if you are a french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french . and if i am a german then i would like to have the my options in german . the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .

IS1007c.B,"what is this single curved and the battery , is it rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? we might check with our r_ and d_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . keep in touch with the r_ and d_ department . the titanium case is the normal case that i'll show you some pictures that i have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . am not very plastic , titanium or whatever . there's another point i want to make , is that the you've seen them i le na my presentation that point out some why buttons are not the not the only ways you can use the user interface is it uses the aspect of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . the here are some examples . they cluster the buttons together . they group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as but this interface are confusing . there are too many buttons . some people are propose voice recognition receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used we might consider that , supposedly . somebody some people use some people use a spinning wheel th with the l_c_ display instead of using the buttons you have a l_c_d_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , touch screen , and some people propose a scroll button . integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . there are a few aspects that i collected here . this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , they are programmable , and then they also secure covers , to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . i'm just saying that the currently in the market there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . and you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . useful for children , and for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr children will not touch the button inside . this is another company that provides big buttons . i see that is useful for old people but for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . and this is another one the part that's a v_ standing for the volume . there's a up arrow and a down arrow . but you the see that in the v_ , the v_ appears to be the down arrow on the top it's confusing interface , and here are is here is a s short summary that i compiled after the findings i found . big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . and user customisable is important and finally simplicity is the key . we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . you are display on the screen . that eliminates all the complicated documentation , what i s propose is that remote controller , i it could be a cube , is small device that looks like a cube and you can just change the the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , if you re use the existing screen , we element eliminate the l_c_d_ , and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , you can find out how much an l_c_d_ will cost and also the cost for the speech recognition . ask our r_ and d_ department . and also the scroller button , how much will it cost . that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your controller any more if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , finally that wil eliminates the need for l_c_d_ , what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off t_v_ button , the off button , the remote there be s instruction on the screen , charge me . you never get it lost because every time you're off the computer the t_v_ you are asked the command the t_v_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by t_v_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . but that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than the numbers .

IS1007c.C,"will do my presentation on the components concept the first thing have done is to made a review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build a remote control . for energy sources we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to store the energy . we also we also can put a regular battery in the remote control . we didn't decide yet which battery we will put inside the remote . it's a point to discuss . concerning the interface we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated and this is the last point , the choice of chips . what i have f found is that basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the better way to provide energy because solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered environment . for the case think that titanium is is a good choice because it's trendy for the interface think that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by s just using rubber buttons , simple buttons it's it's the shape of the of the remote . you will have the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the it's more confog f comfortable that if these it's completely flat . the that's the point . the kinetic one is you can recharge by the and by by just by moving the ar your arm the the remote will accumulate energy . but i d i don't know it's if it is feasible because i don't know if yet if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy . we can see in our r_ and d_ if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . but as norman say if there is already a commercial product available who t who do this we can check to integrate it i into our new remote control . think you it's it's fine you have reviewed all the possibilities but if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the t_v_ screen i don't think we nee we need much buttons in the remote since we just have to navigate and to have a or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , that's a good idea . on the t_v_ screen the how to use your remote . don't really see the advantage of having l_c_d_ on the remote control if we have a big screen and display on the screen . it's fancy trendy and on but when you play with the ipod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s think we can focus on the on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but think l_c_d_ will make us spend a lot of money for not big results . compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . think that as we have seen in the presentation about fifty percent of the percent n choose the button think to have five simple button is sufficient for our functionality . but the is that we can add a functionality on the t_v_ screen and then you choose with the button to you navigate but if i if we could have a display a user interface that is very complete on the t_v_ screen that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and enter and you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . we can think about a vocal command like find and that's a good idea , we can think about having on the on the user interface when you switch on the t_v_ you can write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , things like that . for my part i will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use , where to use , and s and on . and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the t_v_ you have a list with with sports program playing now but every possible word has a probability to come about of the t_v_ if there is more than one person who is watching t_v_ the s the speech recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . think that's a good good option because it's simple and simple to implement also , ","The Industrial Designer presented options for each component.

IS1007c.D,"but people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say this is a complicated and let us see what the market demands . it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . and eighty percent of the people they are always l they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . and the current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . and seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations this should be the solution for them . we should have an l_c_d_ on the rem remote control . as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . if we have a l_c_d_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the t_v_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control . that should be found out by the industrial designers . and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . because they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a l_c_d_ on the remote not on the television . because when you have the l_c_d_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , if you have then l_c_d_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and this menu when you press the menu , in the l_c_d_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the and the third problem was to find the remote control . that's exactly what by voice commander . it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . and when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps , wherever it is . it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged . and the final point is a fancy look . as we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy , very big with lot of buttons . mean you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . but you can have an button for child lock . just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , that he can't use even these other four points they're the market demands and it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th these could be included . we have a problem there . you see if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on basketball score and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . think there should be a prefix to some numbers ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t_v_ twenty five it will be round about one or two percent . that will be too big . and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . if we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad reputation for our company . think we should specify some pre requirements if we want to use a voice commands , these are the practical problems . we need to take care of them in the design . ","The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated. The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost, complicated, and ugly. He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote. He suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen, but that they would inquire about cost before deciding. The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons. The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children.

IS1007d.A,"in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the remote control . let's see the what did you prepare . it's very costly , microphone array . how much does it cost this one ? it's above the budget . how many b battery is there ? the price should be below twelve and a half euro . the price of selling is twenty five euros . what's the price to p to produce ? we don't have all the options . it's below the budget . no it's just if i see the f the rate it's better to do it without l_c_d_ . because that's with l_c_d_ just will increase the price , what about the integration of speech recognition ? it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because parents will lose these or parents they can for forget where they put it or , that even if these modules will be functional will be optional . it inc increase . project evaluation project satisfaction , i don't know , we have to ask these question . think the teamwork was very good . without l_c_d_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . for your work and ","The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without.

IS1007d.B,"s discussed with guillaume . and we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an l_c_d_ or not because it's too expensive . one with and one without l_c_d_s . but both comes with a charger and then detachable and or control module . and detachable big buttons for all people the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it n the two a_a_s batteries in it . a_a_ rechargeable batteries . actually it's a flexible thing . i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , this button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . you can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . here i present another version without the l_c_d_ . w i'll come to that point later on . in either versions you they ha they use the same charger it's that same charger that you can use for the hand phone but again depends on the types . we have to investigate more on that , but but as the marketing manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular you want more function you pay more . if you want less function i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , the l_c_d_ , you can take it you can put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . it's pretty flexible in the price . the i the idea the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n that's our an innovation in this design here . now we come to other important features that i did not tell you . the first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add on . and then we also have security feature it's very robust , and the material , what's the material again ? again and the battery life is is an endurable one , again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . lithium ion may be a good one , again you pay for what you get , and then the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . when you finish watching your t_v_ and you the you t you turn off the t_v_ , and then there's this message coming out that put that back to the charger , and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , we didn't define the vocabulary it's up to the user to define and then because of the chil because children are using the device we have also a of t_v_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . but who will give the scoring we ourself or a third party ? we can improve on the design . som someone commented this is like a the stone age design . we have been focused all this time on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . from the innovation aspect i feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that the retrieval of t_v_ programmes by content , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've lot of functionalities . put six to seven . there w there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l_c_d_ ? we haven't really determined what are actually but you cannot display all on a l_c_d_ . anyway for the users who opt for l_c_d_ we'll give them the l_c_d_ , i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . the easy to use aspect is different for different people . for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . for kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , but what i'm trying to say here is that the we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . to improve on the design . the speech recogniser is a add on module . the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . but the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you gonna maintain the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add ons . i if don't buy now they can buy i in the future . attracting them to come back in again ","The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without.

IS1007d.C,"s i'll show you the two prototypes . here we have the first one with the beautiful l_c_d_ display . and you can just browse into the navigation menu by joystick like button . you can choose the direction you have on the on the side here the microphone for the speech recognition system here . and here the switch that control if you want it's a microphone array . it's just a single microphone , we put it here because when you are browsing your l_c_d_ you will be close to it's better to place it here th than here , and here is a little switch that control if you want the speaker recognition system to to be on or off . and this remote control comes up with its charger . this prototype is made for about fi fifteen dollars but it's just a prototype the and the production costs we can achieve about ten dollars . and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . we have the second version also with the different button configuration . the second version is also simpler , we d we had just have to put the microphone also . it's the same things as presented before . but here we have four buttons for navigation . press one button acting as a enter button . according to what you said it's more robust to the user . and it's also cheaper to produce . we can produce such remote control for about four dollars . you also have the two other modules for the parental control that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i if you if you want to have more power on what you do , and which channel you want to choose and on . h here is just the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch t_v_ , up they come up with their modules , we also have this module for old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . the titanium the price to produce for the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . the without the charger it's about two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems . two dollars for the for the add on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . if you sum up everything wi with the l_c_d_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus two . the total cost if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars . think that the technical in innovation is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen with just four buttons . i'll say three or four . four . it's more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated removing the l_c_d_ gives us a li more liberty to have a fancy look . it's the same for both will give a five , six . for both it's the same innovations . but you have the same programme on the t_v_ screen . if you have the l_c_d_ , think both are really easy to use and p the menu are clear , organised , will give a six for the easy to use . six . let's go back to our laboratory and because it's three different pieces to build but it's it's cheaper if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module , but but we are also the the components will have to change because we have to deal with the shape we can have the same global shape and then add on skins and with this tex spongy texture things like that . come up with new product . and also more more think it's a good idea to have clear points whenever we do a meeting prior to the meeting to have list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , we achieved project goal yes , more or less .

IS1007d.D,"is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? is that two or one ? and also the switch . and you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , and if you disable speech recognition system then ? but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . something like customised . we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and in the market the people are not really interested with l_c_d_ , without l_c_d_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and very handy to hold . and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . in that we could put l_c_d_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . and the third one is easy to use . here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . think it should be much more customised to make a different shapes . and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . finally we have these three criterias . one is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . now you have with l_c_d_ and without l_c_d_ , on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . according to you designers , on this scale the l_c_d_ remote control . how do you look how does it look ? d is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? take three on with l_c_d_ ? without l_c_d_ how would you rate it ? and in the sense of innovativeness , with l_c_d_ . without l_c_d_ ? actually to make it with l_c_d_ you make more efforts . then when it is without l_c_d_ there is not much innovativeness . on the l_c_d_ , according to what i understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have l_c_d_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . on the t_v_ you don't it doesn't display on the t_v_ now . then there is no meaning in having it on the t_v_ . without l_c_d_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without l_c_d_ and without speech recognition . without l_c_d_ take it five ? s think it's better to have this without l_c_d_ . as our programme manager s pro project manager says that without l_c_d_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use . that's going to be an optional . but if you have an add ons , the kids may just hide the parental module and what's the idea about the shape of the remote controls ? can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? or it could be like this the p_c_b_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior shape is different o for all . you need to look into the material . the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . this is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . and the leadership was excellent . and new ideas found . that is within the budget .

IS1008b.A,"actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . and we'll issue some information from all of you . and it's in the , in the sharing folder . and will invite the christine and the ed and agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . the agenda of the meeting is opening . then i'm going to talk about the project management , and i'm doing the project management and secretary both , to take the minutes of the meeting . and there are three presentations . one is new project requirements . and the second one about decision on remote control functions . and finally we are closing . and the meeting time will be forty minutes , management come with the new proposal , and i have to discuss a few points on this . both says new insights in the aim of your project . the one is the teletext becomes outmoded , because if because of the computer systems and the new technology . we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . and the second one is about the remote control . should be used only for the t_v_ . and the third point , it's very important to establish our marketing or corporate image , with this new project or new product . i'll invite christine to discuss about the functional design . if you can add other facility , other feature , like unbreakable . because especially today , you have the family and the kids , and the kids throw it if you can add the feature , for your fabric whatever in your outline design with unbreakable , that will give a lot of advantage for our product , because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing . i know the project plan and the budget . i will send you a mail , at the end of the day , the company wants to make at least the fifty million euro . and the price will be very reasonable on the sales side . that eddie will talk to you about how much the price how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market . and i have one the suggestion or opinion . this remote control , it can be for like universal , to use for any t_v_ . and it will be slim , but let's try it , with the different the designs , the functional designs . what do you think about the design , what he was talking about of the speech recognition ? what suggest to you , christine , if you need some the technical feedback , or some training , about this facility , especially for the speech recognition , recommend you some companies like intel or i_b_m_ , because they're already in this speech recognition part , and if you want , coordinate , to get some information , and you can let me know , what the details you require to add this feature in this project . we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from what today . but end of the day , you're the sales guy , it's it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us i don't mind to convince , the management to spend some more money on the project , if you can make out of the management says , they don't want certain facilities , they want something new , like speech recognit definitely they will agree , and hope convince the management on that , for anybody need any help , for time being , on this subjects , come back to me , and christine , try to help you to get some the technical the companies to help you for make a design slim , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , ","The Project Manager gave new requirements for the product: the remote will not include a teletext function, will only be used for television, and must show the corporate image.

IS1008b.B,"i figured we should identify some user requirements , and from my experience , i wanna and from research i did , the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those , and , as i said in the first meeting , and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in in the construction , especially in the the outside of the product i did a little history on the remote controls all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today which the one in the middle is r really something to keep in mind . you could throw it at things if the t_v_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . but just took some different schematics and this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . personal preferences , i'm really thinking outside the box here , and that we should consider perhaps having an a size remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . something that's very flexible and inflatable it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and blend in with things , think it needs to be waterproof , because sometimes they fall into cups one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , i keep pushing on the remote control , and i don't know if it's actually understood my message , think it should give you some an oral cue . and course i never wanna replace the battery . titanium would be heavy , too , wanted feedback , but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts . i like titanium . nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , it'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though . might be hard to find , though . training is always an issue with commands . we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , but anyway , think also that this might impact the battery life . what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly or set it out in the sun and it gets from the light , solar cell inside there clearly your research and and ours heading in the same direction , the only thing that i saw missing from your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . i also think that th f the feel of it is when you hold it , is something that was expressed more in my design those are the parameters that an industrial designer's more thinking about , th the look and the feel , do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , that would provide some guidance ? it says individual actions , i'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . and specific instructions will be sent by our coach . we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process , we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , our meeting time has run out .

IS1008b.C,"do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . it seems also like with the speech recognition , it's a great feature , but if you're watching t_v_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , then you have to make that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the t_v_ speech , and the user's speech . the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . in our case , existing remote controls . we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , and then what the remote control should look like , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off . you need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . you need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever . the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . here we've got two examples where here on the left hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . the buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that has the minimum functionalities that are needed . and it looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . i would be inclined to go towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons . my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design sleek and simple . that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , should we make a decision about what features we actually want to include , we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ? i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , ","The group then discussed hard materials to include in the design.

IS1008c.B,"why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , it chips , it if you drop it , if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , one thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having have to see how kid friendly it is and all that , it's a very short presentation , i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board i took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which i completely agree with christine's idea to have it molded , it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do quasi measurements on their hand size , if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . one thing might be interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . and also you had issues with the batteries running out , thought we could put a little battery life light on it that goes dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . you'd have something like this with an on off switch fairly big , in the corner and by itself , you don't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have one of those toggle displays for , channels and volume , for surfing channels and then volume , the volume would be the up and down , volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . and then here you'd have your standard , telephonish number pad . and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . again you can have a little l_c_d_ light somewhere , the flip thing and as you can see , it's a very simple design , which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , depending on how much the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . as you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad , that would be in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad a little bit lower it's used less frequently . once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and but th for that you'd also have to do an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . already the customisability is a really good new gimmick . it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have a big display right in front of you . if we're trying to keep costs down , then sacrificing the display is a way to go . it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for what about the buttons , would the buttons be wood too , or ","She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood, so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases.

IS1008c.C,"we were looking he specifically at the components the following components , the case , the power supply , the means of communications with the television set . in instance we had talked about using some speech recognition , you have to have microphone no you don't actually i haven't have to have microphone in the device , it has to hear the speaker it could be in the television set , could be in the device , and a w a way of making beeps or sounds you can find it when it's gets lost . our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , for the case , we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . course , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but that doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non option we can we can really explore , then we were thinking about rubber , but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and th there might be some problems with the m how it's goes with the board . and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , we still had titanium and wood available , but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood . then there's this other matter of the chips and we could use a simple design on the board , these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one . and then there was the regular which i regret that i've forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one . the other option was this advanced chip on print , we found that it includes this infrared sender , which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . and manufacturing has told us that they've recently developed a sensor and a speaker that would be integrated into this advanced chip on print , now jumping right to our personal preferences i'd really think we should , use some of some really exotic woods , like you guys come from tropical countries you can kinda think of some trees and some woods . that people will might really want to design their own cases , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , and then we should go with the solar cells as as the microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . and my recommendations for the new remote control w would be to have have it be made out of wood . it's multiple chip design and it's printed on to the circuit board . but i'll find out more at our next meeting . because it gets brittle , cracks we expect these these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your be like a copper hinge or context sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ else is in . what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like some foam rubber ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . we'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna learn about labour laws . in different countries and wher we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries . actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying a working wage to the person who made the device . do how much it costs , to add a little display like this do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? the advanced chip on print is what what we've deci we've determined and the engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case . a customisable and they could be rubber like they are now , ","The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation, which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design.

IS1008d.C,"i've done a presentation , but it covers work that we've both done , if i'm missing anything , christine can just correct me . from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and the colour would be customisable , you can stain the wood whatever colour . in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the l_c_d_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , then you just take it off . this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow l_c_d_ display . the yellow button you have is the on off button , it's really big , hard to miss . you have the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . the green are the channel changing . s and it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_ , and on the left hand side you have the ability to turn off the voice recognition . additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . but it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , just use my voice . it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . and the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as and part of a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . mean this is excessively heavy , that's it for our presentation actually . no we do , but it's not filled in . you're right , yes . you can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it highly customisable , on the web people can look at the different options they have , see what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , the weight and feel . think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , we want this done differently . the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . no , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and that's a good idea . that's actually good place to advertise it too . a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user tested and completely flopped , when it gets re released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .

IS1008d.D,"the prototype is very within the design and ideas that we've talked about on the previous meetings . now it goes into this next phase as the financial marketing we haven't come to mine yet , we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a l_c_ display . l_c_ display is gonna be very expensive , we don't have the price up there , if we add approximately two to three euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what the company had initially requested . but as far as production i'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see the problem with our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera this is just production cost , it is not advertising cost , it's not transportation cost and that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company . to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . it's gonna be very hard to reduce . now i'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . since we need to have some type of idea on a market we had independent study that says it this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which means that if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually a tremendous amount . if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty five euro , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our retailers . at two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit . did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan the fancy stylishness of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . but being that the market changes very quickly , there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . now we have to come up with a decision . can the company sell two million units ? can it sell it for fifty euros ? there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit . that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , right before the eur the world cup . world soccer . world cup soccer , ","The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group.

TS3009b.D,"i'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . the first findings are that people think most controls are very ug ugly . they also say , that's about thought it was fifty per cent , that more money will be spent on better looking controls . almost every user uses it d the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . furthermore , it's seventy five per cent of the users zaps a lot . thus it might be might be smart to make a big zapping button in the middle , you can reach it with your thumb . a lot of losers users lose their controls in their living room . it might be sensible to make some button on your television , that's your your control beeps that you can find this very easily . thirty four per cent thinks it's too too difficult to learn . it's better to put our attention to the design . you can pick up and use it , than next point . r_s_i_ . research shows that they like to have a little l_c_d_ screen on their zapping device . thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of the people like that . i don't have any information on that . and another thing is speech recognition . they also like that , have a table here about the l the relevance of the buttons . the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . but it's very important to make the power , channel and volume buttons near to the thumb , you can't have r_s_i_ consequences . we can make a symbol of the company right here . and if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . the symbol's always on and we've chose for the younger one . research has shown that it's a high interested in features . which programme you are l watching no not clickable . it should be at the top . alright , we go with the l_c_d_ screen ? we have few functions , and we can put the l_c_d_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . you should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance . but what he said about r_s_i_ was t kinda true . it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . the channel channel buttons should be far apart , up and down . right , just make some decisions . i do think we have to put that underneath a clip . but you can z you can zap t you can zap to the video channel from zero to but if we're choosing to incorporate these buttons , you have to have channel setting , for a screen fu channel setting .
