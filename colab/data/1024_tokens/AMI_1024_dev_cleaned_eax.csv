ES2005a.A,twenty five . but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . for what do we think a good size would be for this ? ,They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. 
ES2005a.B,"being as a marketing exper expert i will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? what speciality other remote controls are having they really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , ",
ES2005a.C,"making a profit of fifty million euros . it's go gonna have to be pretty damn trendy . the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things presumably that might be an idea to put into . you do the looking around at other remote controls . and you could look into how it's made i_e_ like how you make it all in one , how what materials are available to you whatever . shapes and colours and how to make it attractive . ","They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

ES2005a.D,"the universal ones . my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . we could think about colour ? and as you say , we need to have some gimmick , thought something like if you lose it and you can whistle , more like a p_d_a_ just hand held , you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ?

ES2005b.A,"and was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? is that a function we want in the remote ? much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping shouting , and then , what would the response be ? it beeps back at you plug it in , press f_ five ? and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and what novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . and novel feature which we just brought up was this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold it'll pick up as a distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say here i am of this sort . and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , right , more low tech and not too many buttons . missed the budget thing , it was fifty million euros ? guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic an energy source which'd probably just be your regular batteries we could do that too . the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power and lastly the transmission interface is just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . here's a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me . personal preferences , programmable options which just require a small amount of memory , just the user can put in their favourite channels and their preferred volume settings that when they turn it on it's not blasting . and the the bells and whistles that we mentioned they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and whistles . you just say whatever you want the remote for , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within within hearing range . there's a good chance the t_f_t_ screen would break or get damaged . no it's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits .

ES2005b.B,"f f_ eight . yes , i have to look at the market potential for this product , then the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey . seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also . but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five , they find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . computer adjusting , but if we add speech recognition as as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , glow in dark . we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . ","The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition. He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape.

ES2005b.D,"no signal . i'm concerned with what effect the apparatus should have on the user i want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . but i've got some pictures here of some leading ones . these are two leading remote controls at the moment . this one's got loads of buttons , personally i prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver think we need to l the ergonomics is quite important , and thought not too edgy and like a box , think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it looks . was bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow in the dark easy finder with the a whistle function or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . or a little base station . but what about something that's built into the t_v_ that you can press and it'll send out a little signal that will activate the remote control starts to beep . if it's not too expensive s it's a good gimmick . what as about the material is not this material , but more like this rubbery material , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic ","The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly.

ES2005c.B,"in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , when we did our remote control market survey we found that people l people do have preference for tho fancy mobi remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . when we did fashions recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that because you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . we can just have a remote control and casings of different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . in that way we need not to d have different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? solar power will w also not be a good idea , we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . you have to keep your pen separate , because i used your pen . or we are going to discuss something ?

ES2005c.C,"mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . i m the one thing about these ones is these kl secured areas i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing . like have it hinge rather than clip on or whatever . it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , although , th to be they have got they are going crazy with the l_c_d_ technology now , si since we're going for the the k the company colours , your lemon wasn't that far s i like the colourful buttons as like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , and that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . plastic initial plastic with a latex kinda sheath ? or limit even just a limited multi colour it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . although this also comes to shape as double curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . it does seem a bit again childish you don't necessarily have to have it clearly identified as a fruit just to have that fruitish shape , there's a good man . there's a good idea . speech recognition , how good is the speech recognition thing ? do we want to just have a device that sits and pretends it's a fruit ? l like think of a fruit that could sit independently on its own like an apple . again like we could have , mean , we could quite easily have the main body be a different not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour , you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it thing . it does leave them with an obligation to having a rechargeable stand , that not only it doubles as a stand , but for using it as recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . and if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . dele accidentally deleted what i was supposed to say next . our next meeting's in half an hour and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . i wonder if they mean like literally make it , buttons and everything . no , that's us our discussion over we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , there we go . warning , finish meeting now .

ES2007b.A,"just wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . right , welcome to meeting b_ . this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , i'm supposed to be doing now . and , i'm just here to liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and what this meeting is all about is i'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , we'll talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . this meeting it's not very long . it's probably down to about thirty five minutes now . want each of your presentations to not be too long , five minutes , something like that . if you haven't done a powerpoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a t_v_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . i d it sounds like you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or i would say it's if it's simple to do , i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it's gotta d look like it's in the r_ and r_ . it's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , i would say scra i'd say scrap that straight off . i'll see if get hold of them for the next meeting . we've decided that it's gonna be , we're going for a basic television remote . we should just go with the simplest option on everything , and that would be infra red , energy source , that would be batteries . mean we can look into using the s , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long lasting batteries . have you guys found out if we can e mail to each other ? can you all d e mail me your e mail addresses ? it was blue writing on a yellow background , but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products you can have a look at our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . and we stop for lunch now . ",The project manager had the team members re-introduce themselves and then briefed the team on his own duties and on the meeting agenda. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for batteries and infra-red signals. The user interface designer discussed what features the remote was required to have and presented two existing products which were based on different concepts. The project manager then introduced some new requirements to bear in mind when designing the remote. The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences on remotes in general and on voice recognition and the team discussed the option to have an ergonomically designed remote. The project manager briefed the team on the decisions made so far and the team discussed color options for the remote. 
ES2007b.B,"i'm gonna draw it on the board then . the idea is that we've got the energy source think two batteries , then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal , which could be an infra red signal , which will be sent by an electronic chip . swi i th changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but we can make the signal strong enough to go through walls if you fancy it . but it could come in different colours and have the r_r_ colours just somewhere ",The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for batteries and infra-red signals. The project manager briefed the team on the decisions made so far and the team discussed color options for the remote. 
ES2007b.C,"as far as the infra red signal , do we have control over , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the t_v_ , and still have it be operational ? and as far as methods , i was looking at already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities and does the basics , but things that seem like absolute must haves would be a volume control , channel keys up down , but then also a numerical key pad that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up down , and in the research that i was doing there's two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting i gathered that's what we were going after , the engineering centred ones provide a lot of functionality , the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . no that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know . what do you guys have a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? and what i didn't mention yet really is the like the ergonomic design . everything is going t ergonomic , and that could be one of our niches p in the market , what about just from the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? we should probably consult with our legal department we can do some really in that department , the ergonomic department , we can make some really good improvements . are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . and this is something that came on down from the higher ups , we are beholden to them . not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .

ES2007b.D,"is a battery like the only way of no like cha always changing batteries can get like annoying . how about bluetooth ? for our marketing report we observed remote control users in a usability lab , seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really and fancy . current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user . i was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . has to look really flashy groovy for people to buy it . and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in voice activating . but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . voice activation might not be the best . also with with buttons , a thing called r_s_i_ , can't we have different colours in the remotes , we have to have it one colour .

ES2007c.A,"alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , we're gonna hear your th three little presentations , o i'd like to hear who's g who's on the from catherine actually first . that might be an idea of using the rubber , rubber , we're all going we're all liking that idea ? let's have rubber push buttons , hey . is advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p_c_b_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the infra red sender ? if it's something that's inside the unit . i it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . let's not let's not bother with the chip on print . what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? but the fact that this rubber i is actually used in these anti r_s_i_ ps specific now the trouble is we've already decided that we're going with the that works already , that's cheap . they do . that would mean you'd need a television that has bluetooth in it , which no television does , this that's very good . we're ahead of the game there . right , we're gonna go back to going with the kinetic thing , and i'm not about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the from you catherine wi your y you're gonna be working on the look and feel design . gabriel , you're gonna be working on , come up with the user interface design . then you two are gonna be working together on this . and you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . come up ki be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some i some physical ideas . and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . we'll look into this lock key ","The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The team then discussed and decided what materials, components, and what type of battery to use in their product. This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote.

ES2007c.B,"for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , you can have a kinetic provision of energy , or you can use solar cells , but i'm not about that indoors , really , but think the what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . and if we want something fancier , the kinetic provision of energy could be for the case of the remotes itself , they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . you can have curved one or a double curved one , then the case material itself , it can be either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium . and th for each of them you have cases where titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . but if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . and also it doesn't break as easily you can have basic push buttons or a scroll wheels , like you have on a mouse , or you could have l_c_d_ , which gives you a display . and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push buttons . the push buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be if we get an advanced chip which is used for the l_c_d_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . if it's not chip on print then , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra red . i'm just guessing . but it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and the kinetic mo provision of energy then . it's been done for watches , but i haven't seen that for remotes , yet .

ES2007c.C,"there's sometimes combinations , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . mean what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t_v_ on like , turn the t_v_ on , and i turns comes on , a it just gives you a verbal response . we want it rub rubber double curved . rubber keys , i'm continuing with the user interface topic . and the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , like the coffee machine . already mentioned the speech recognition interface . we vetoed that idea . they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod . but they suggested going i a little bit into a niche , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done give you an example here of good layout and bad layout this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v_ on both of them , this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . was against the speech recognition and against going towards anything in a niche sense . i didn't think the spinning wheel or the l_c_ display were crucial for us . we're not gonna have any display we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . it will either have a lock button like we mentioned or a cover like that . it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too gaudy , i would say mayb couple of colours like like a black with yellow and somewhere , the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . it's different , but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator . we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a and an avocado key on them . the power button could be like a big apple where , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , just by the fact of choosing .

ES2008b.B,"you just have to push it in really hard . this is our working design presentation . had a bit of some issues with this , because i wasn't able to find everything i needed , what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . you make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . the findings that i got very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra red is the best way to do that the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , the components that we find here are the energy source , the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . and personal preferences , besides the fact that i can't spell , we need a long lasting energy source , we need a chip that works with the user interface , and we need a reliable and clear infra red signal , it's a british thing . if we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in electronics then you automatically , a younger group that's who's gonna be attracted to this . that's probably population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , but why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple but i th regardless we're aiming for the under sixty five but you could have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your ipod . that might contribute to less people losing it too if it stays in one place . hopefully it is there for people . in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements .

ES2008b.C,"there's a wee plug just that one there and then you have to press function f_ eight repetitive strain injury . i'm gonna talk about the technical functions design of the remote control we need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . it's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , it sends a message to the television first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . we need a clear idea of exactly what this product does , and what the end user is gonna want from this product . a way i'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , and then trying to get some feedback about h how these particular prototypes work , when a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . in some sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design but within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . the first of these is technological we need to find a balance between features and price . things like voice recognition would add to the price but it would also im improve the design of the product . i had a look on the web to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . in analysing these we can consider what things what's good about them , how we can improve on the designs that i found here's two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . on the left here we've got an engineering based design for a remote control , it's one that's got lots of buttons , everything you might possibly want to do is there , the one on the right is a lot more basic . it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . personally wa what i want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . that's ergonomically designed . there's certainly a market for technology that looks that was just on the d on the company web site , i suppose it's similar to a very basic web browser . this index appears on the television screen with just some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . and it gives you information , mostly rather boring like what's on t_v_ next and share prices and that thing . it's earl it's pretty old technology . it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . it's like double r_ . i would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises . si simplicity and fashion . it's for the ultimately lazy people , the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . it's going to appeal to people , people who have problems with technology , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , which are hidden away in some way we should investigate whether it needs a battery that's possible .

ES2008c.B,"components design . the main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or even a double curved case . i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . for buttons we have pushbuttons , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high tech and have an l_ l_c_d_ screen . circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , and then battery is where things get most exciting . we can have your basic double a_ batteries , but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery , simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . or a solar battery , although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . personal preferences that i was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . if we're going for fashion in our cases , that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . titanium , some wood . we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials , and we wanna go for simplicity . probably pushbuttons , but i'm intrigued by the idea of a scroll wheel , if anyone has anything and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . solar i don't think would be such a good idea , but we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an l_c_d_ . i'm not but i'll let as soon as i get any pictures . i know if we do have a double curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . no idea , no idea . i'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me you'd be advocating an l_c_d_ then ? we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v_c_r_ if i've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . if it's latex if it's latexy my understanding of a latex case is that it's hard to protect inside , there's something to be said , we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to r_ repetitive stress injuries and things could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? or the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . and you press the centre button , that's your all purpose select button right there . an l_c_d_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? in different fruit and vegetable colours , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . i don't really to tell you as far as decisions . if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , do we want a scroll wheel , when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . i'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if spongy is the in thing . what i've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . and we want a curved case , or a double curved ? it might be better to put our money into the like the kinetic battery and the case ","The industrial designer discussed possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, options for buttons, and options for batteries.

ES2008d.D,"could the middle button of the on screen menu function as a power button ? i like this one , it just it's like small but still like cute looking , but how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , looking thing we're supposed to have one that we do it for . i was a little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do , i have to like write something on the whiteboard , some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . what we wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i'll tabulate an average and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true or false , first we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective . in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle i'm gonna say it's like a three . and same scale for functionality , is it functional ? it's extremely functional , is it technologically innovative ? not really , not much , we don't have the l_c_d_ screen , and if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if it's made of latex or rubber i it's spongy all the way . and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? is it gonna be yellow ? and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , i'm gonna give it a one . also we talked earlier about r_s_i_ and wanting to prevent any like carpal tunnely thing . do we think that the latex grip appropriately takes that into account ? i'll give it a two , and the ease of learning it . also earlier we had something about losing it and now we're not addressing that i'm gonna give it a four , how w how does it address just being simple ? it like wants to be simple but it's not like simple , and fashionable ? it's bringing technology and fashion together real really and does it meet our like demographic need for international appeal , that whole thing ? don't we need plastic , and it was rubber and special colour , we have six . if i'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , we could've taken that into account . the pen was a little distracting for me personally , that was the last one , like i chose not to do a powerpoint i would break it . i would break it . looks like a penguin , like with no eye . nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , the excel thing is pretty and usually , like whiteboards are good , like crossing out ideas , or like if we had like a brainstorming period . we all needed them separately , on the whiteboards in this room . it is black , grey . feel like if you're really doing like a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , ","The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic.

ES2015b.B,"i will take this time just to apologise . i , i only , received my emails later on . was too busy carried away doing my own thing , was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . one is the visibility in the dark , and we could use illuminated buttons , or we could use fluorescent materials also we could use an alarm . if we lost the remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , another thing we d missed out on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . from previous researches i've carried out on other projects , we've learnt about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . they can be heated and and cooled , and they change the shape of the metal . the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , everything would spring apart . all the individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , the user would return the p product to the company , it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . also there is components . but i haven't put this plan together yet . this would actually show the circuit diagram . although i haven't come up with the final circuit yet . i it just shows what energy source . it could be a battery , i was just wondering about the , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , i d , what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . it's just information that like television timetables , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and more research into that one . like big b buttons , for people you are visually impaired . the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .

ES2015b.C,"there're two functional design options . a multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . and a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . a single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . that a single function remote control would be preferable , it'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . and less functions would have to be included . it would be cheaper to make . and with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . might be quite expensive to do that though . i don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your t_v_ , you'd want to be able to use it , would you be able to , put the little device anywhere ? it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , would it need a battery then ? and then that would be more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as ","The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote.

ES2015b.D,"as far as we know , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? because we're trying to do much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . i'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . i've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , and some internet research . and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . not just in electronic fashion . any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and actually to go with that , i'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . teletext , now i'm not too clear on what that is . and has a r a high relevance of six point five . it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . remote controls are often lost somewhere . remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . but we'll have to also avoid , buttons responding to the slightest touch as guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . an l_c_d_ screen though might be something that , you can shift through pages li the way this powerpoint is working . our priority really should be unique design . in my opinion it should be , user friendly and unique . i th myself , voice recognition scares me off . if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy but if we wanna make fifty million , and have everyone want this remote control , we should stick to the basics . think , the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . it's probably r_ r_r_ in yellow . are we going to write off the l_c_d_ option ? no l_c_d_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . the other option , referring to the battery thing is , how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds when you're s and then it goes , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . it might be perceived as tacky , glow in the dark . i was just gonna throw out there the thought about personalising the remote control . dunno if there's something that diff , like five different face plates . you could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .

ES2015c.B,"first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . there are several components of , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . we could use a basic battery , there's a hand powered dynamo which is a thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite useful . lots of considerations for the case , like what shape it would be , curved or flat . we don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the anti r_s_i_ . titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . right our choice for buttons as with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons . they're quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . my personal preferences ? we could go for the kinetic energy source . it's not been seen before , it could be quite a , a novelty factor , and also energy saving you're producing the energy , you don't need an external battery supply or solar panels . rubber casing i thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti r_s_i_ and like more choice with aesthetics . and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , if the , if it was just , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . it was the whole thing would be removable . you can get outer casing for ipods and something , that's just it's protective as as far as i know . it should be . like as a backup for something . may that could be the backup . like if the kinetic thing , what's best about that is that it's instant energy . but if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus much on that . it'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . it can be a bit , overwhelming . i'd assume an internal light , that comes through . there would have to , have to be some parts transparent around the buttons , if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . i don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . we possibly could take a more abstract design . like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , i , we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential . that's the simple . regular chip . because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as we're just going for power , channels , volume , we can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , i thi we should keep to that rather than moving to animals ","The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote, energy source options, and materials for the remote, case, and buttons.

ES2015d.B,"it's palm held . one plus one would be eleven , we can further define that . i wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . we went for like a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . and the feel of it , we've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . as for the colours , we were presented with limited range of colours for this prototype . but we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . or the combination . and we're thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just blends in banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . we thought of the components it was definitely focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , we've been quite successful with the rubber coating th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that we would've necessarily chosen . diff if you can visualise this in colours it would look quite fancy . and the use of the rubber . and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no l_c_d_ control , if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's probably halfway . again the colour comes into this . does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . easy to use . but it's not obvious from the outside that's gonna happen you can't s particularly see an alarm . we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . four we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , to go about our design task . and like if we had decided to use the l_c_d_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . and also our personal coach helped us along the way , fantastic . very much .

IS1003c.A,"let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . i'm not the one in the middle is very attractive . we'll have big discussion i suppose after that , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . do you think they will be able to use gestures ? because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , they will get injuries because of that ? or if you say channel three two three four six five , they will be bored after a while . but suppose you got a cold . you have a mute remote controller . but suppose you have a family watching t_v_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? they say channel four channel three all the time , how much will it cost ? but there is one problem that baba talked about is the international the recognition system will be able to understand french . and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? seems to be quite complex . but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . you you can build a black box and put it on t_v_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller . try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller ? but w we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . let's go to the industrial designer . we'll be able to take a decision after that , think there's something wrong with your you record it somewhere else . it will be interesting after your presentation to have baba's presentation . and it can attract all the ecological k consumers but about the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics we can try to do something with wood . and think something very low level wou would be enough . we have only five minutes left . we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , cheap imprint you s you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working something spongy . it's natural . we can stay with wood . and what about the user interface concept ? google and fancy ? because that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . we'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . and l_c_d_ buttons . for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not too difficult to add . commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .  we'll you will all have to work in your direction . you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition . you will have to work more , baba , on the spongy way to add spongy touch to the buttons and try to find shape for the wooden remote control . and i sup we'll have to evaluate th the product too . you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us modelling a cl a clay remote control , and that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .

IS1004b.B,"the powerstick . spanish name would work what does it mean in spanish ? you could have the fonts special , although you don't wanna cut cut women out of the potential buyers though , th the on though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . i was still was still working on this twenty five euro price point because actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low price even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching t_v_ you're gonna have a lot of this background noise from the t_v_ which might interfere with the while researching this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote , and then also searched for which are the top rated remote controls on epinions dot com , which is a customer written review site . and this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant , all the functions are controlled through the l_c_d_ screen but the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control , and it's difficult to to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of changing the channel . because lot of this can't be done for twenty five eu euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the l_c_d_ screen this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's very simple , this is something else we might wanna consider , is really limiting the number of buttons , but also the location and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . think one option is to have little flip open door that that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons if i had my perfect remote control , i'd probably just have no numbers on it because they're just in the way . one of the really useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . the scroll wheel could be used without an l_c_d_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . and we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . then you say potentially you can then do other like change the lights , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , one other thing that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets , though , actually i'm not if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i can't hear it very i don't really want to drown out what people are saying by talking when i'm instead of pressing up on a remote control . you say we're focusing on t_v_ , but is it still a like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of televisions ? for twenty five euro ? it's impossible . because for twenty five euro all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , would like to know if there's any chance of increasing the of increasing the unit price . you could have the name of the programme , you could have the start time where it's up to . the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have wireless internet connection or a can we increase the price point of this remote control ?

IS1004c.A,"today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of l_c_d_ screen on the remote control because of costs . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform too long . and you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a l_c_d_ on a banana also . you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . you are user interface guy . is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? this is not s really to do control . comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . this is out of discussion . it looks like we're going completely to forget about the l_c_d_ thing . no we can't use that . but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than in wood . yes it is . if you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . before st before ending the meeting i'd like to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . we need to take some de decisions about about what we're going to do . we're going for a stylish banana shape . we'll have a base station extra on the side . we that means we need a button on th on the basis . basis station ,   can you go quickly  we are going to add also you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo button . and you have two wheels . you have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface , you two you have to work together to model the first first prototype . marketing expert have to go to product evaluation . ","The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design. He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. Then they move on to the three presentations. They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. Next, the user interface specialist presents. He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver. After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV.

IS1004c.B,"what do by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of a banana , which fruit are you thinking of ? or you want just some like fruit logo on the i'm not , i'm not really if that would really appeal to everyone though , like just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , is fruit but it has to be easy to to use though and to hold probably the only thing is a banana that think of , a cucumber . received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , it means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . you could build that in , you could link the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on the remote control . but it means we c we can consider this from theoretical or usability viewpoint without worrying too much about how to develop it because we have this already done . it's it'll recognize guess keywords , but keywords in a certain order like a phrase . it's designed as a fun thing , it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , i've just done a quick mock up of some of the features of our potential funky looking remote control but i've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , but it's important , to have two scroll wheels because , you want one for the channel , but you also want one for the volume , i've also included this turbo button because every design should have a turbo button , with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if if i'm going if i'm scrolling past them but we can discuss about what other buttons we need , it's just couple of scroll wheels and a button it's hard to get many buttons on a banana you need an on and off switch , but you could o you could turn it on by taking the top off the banana i f it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , to say hello in the morning . i don't know if that speech recognition is , even if we can do it , it's not really appropriate for television environment . it might be useful to have some base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and and the remote control starts beeping , this is a way of finding the remote . that fits in with the spongy design philosophy . but are we set on the banana idea ? capsicum or pepper . i don't know , it seems a little bit bulky to me , like but like a banana you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel on top are there any issues where we place this chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana ? it depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then we wanna sell a collection of fruit , like a different fruit for each device . that's a pretty handy feature . i'm just wondering actually , i this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's it seemed like it first seems a bit niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was stylised banana ? rather than having it yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it silver . like still in the shape of a banana . but just not exactly the same texture as a banana which it's probably best actually on the underneath of the device , we need a power on off switch as if the traditional user is gonna buy a banana remote ","The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends. They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. They have the option of using that technology. He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have. After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. They agree on having base station with the remote.

"
IS1004c.C,"this is going to be about the component design . first thing is we need power source for the remote control . was of the idea that we can have two power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used it'll be pretty innovative kind . then we need plastic with some elasticity that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , and then it should be double curve . the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve . but plastic is is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down push buttons for the traditional users that they don't feel they are alienated , then there are different chips , one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . we can have it at one of the boundaries that things are slightly better . or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , our t_v_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v_c_r_ d_v_d_ players which are usually attached with the t_v_ , you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping where the remote is . basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the thing sits . l_c_d_ has already been ruled out , a_s_r_ has been ruled out . but our targets are very high , means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make . ","Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control. He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. They agree on having base station with the remote. "
IS1004c.D,"i investigate deeper the preference of the users . what i found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they want something new technologic technologically speaking , what they find more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . now more aspect , ma more a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to watch , to see . all this fashion it's fruit and the theme is fruit and vegetables . and also in the u_s_a_ the current the mor the most popular feeling it's a spongy . i didn't miss and i saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . vegetable textures and all this kind . i ha i haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the remote control may could remind some vegetable , instead of vegetable , some natur natural object no , not n not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend will be different . do you want a an l_c_d_ with twenty five euros ? and also it's i'm not convinced about this l_c_d_ we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . but i'm a bit worried about the budget .

IS1006b.D,"as you you already know me , sammy benjo . i am the expert in marketing and i want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , what i suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what could be and what should be a good remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls what they like , what they don't like we've conducted a survey on the use of remote controls what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . first of all , they find it very ugly . they're not colour , not shape , they're all the same , what is interesting is that it seems that they were people are ready to pay for and look and fancy looking remote control , think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that and the other thing is that the current remote controls are not easy to use and it the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . we see that they zap very often think this is a very important functionality and most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used , think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they they don't even find it it's often lost somewhere in the in your home if we have something where we could ask the remote control where are you ? like something to like t phones . some of the phones have some of this functionality . and because of the fact that there are many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , most of the people say they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . and they are bad for r_s_i_ but don't remember what is r_s_i_ . but we have to take this into account . we've listed a couple of that may be used by u the user in the current available remote controls but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . people want to have a power button . channel selection is often used very often used now i remember what is r_s_i_ it's repetitivity stress injury . volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . all of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . it seems that people find teletext relevant , but seems that it's average relevant at least , if there are good reason not to put teletext it's one of the thing the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , you wouldn't have to tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . we've conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . and as the age goes up the relevance goes down . now it really depends on the targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? if we are targeting young people then it's probably something we have to consider . if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be that's my findings . we should aim at the young people . but think they are those who might be more interested in a new device . in general the early adopters of a new device are young people , then teletext is useless for them because they have other means of finding their information . i would say the simplest one as long as there are the find the buttons that i need every time i need a button . and when does it turn off ? according to your distance to and the angle if you have a stereo system . i'm not about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? is it a touch screen but it has to be with an back light somehow . if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would i do can i do that with this ? these days we have hundreds of channels , one thing is that as i said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . even if they are only watching four or five channels , they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , the user will just be able to say can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or it will be something like volume , up , down . first of all this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . very expensive , in a given room there might be more than one remote control . we would have each one and with our own personal settings . but that's ex that's expensive .

Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. "
TS3004a.A,"hello . hello . you have to put it exactly on the actually my laptop doesn't work , you all read what we are going to do or not ? made a simple presentation . how does this work ? that's my name , . we're going to make remote control , are we going to this agenda of our meeting . this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . it has to be original , trendy , user friendly first we have three steps of making the remote control . fir the first thing is th the functional design , we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and how the the remote control works , that's where we're going to look in the functional design , the second thing is the conceptual design , that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . and we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market . and the third thing is the detailed design it's exactly how it looks and whatever . these are two smartboards , with the s an introduction of that one . and you already saw all that you here can put things in the red project map . what we're going to do first is you have to draw favourite animal on the whiteboard and and say why it's your favourite animal . and we have to use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . first have to show you , you can come here to have a look how it works . use pen format . and a different colour can use here line width ten . just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . it's a very elephant , you can see . it's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . it's in format . just make a new blank page . you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , these pens would be just you write it down and you download it to word , but i d it would be just in typed words in word , it's not that as i th thought it would be . now we just have to save everything , what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros . and we have to make a profit of fifty million euros , we have to use a big market in europe . the production cost are about half the price of selling price , can someone make a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , we're gonna have a little discussion about what experience are with a remote control the and everything , that's a good question . i don't think you can buy a universal remote control for twenty five euros , we just say that's universal remote control . lot of buttons on the remote control . what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? but it's not t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . and if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too fragile fragile . you can put games on your remote control . whatever . if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because it's too expensive . the option , just the option , that's does it has to b have to be like a different form than a normal remote control it's very hard to make it fold open and to l look like it's very we have to keep it like square , just normal remote control . just think about it . we have to close this to finish this meeting , we have another thirty minutes , then we're going to meet again . this if you have to n know if it's for s a t_v_ , a d_v_d_ player , all that things . what's in the market , what buttons do you have . see you in thirty minutes . ","The Project Manager introduced himself and the project to the group. He presented an agenda for the rest of the project. The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the board. The Project Manager discussed the projected price point, profit aim, and production cost for the project. The group discussed their initial ideas about the product design. They decided to make the remote a universal remote. They discussed the form of the device; it was suggested that the device could have a folding-open design or a touch-screen interface. They discussed energy source options and could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand. They also discussed how to make the remote look more unique; it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device.

TS3004a.C,"my laptop is crashing . it probably would be universal . and also for the v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ player and how big should it be ? o or you could th think of an small touch screen on the remote control . or to keep it easy and small . and how about the batteries ? should you put it in a recharger if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but i don't the project projection costs are for such a thing . and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . and what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are like when you fold it open , when i'm watching t_v_ i'm just using like five buttons or ",They decided to make the remote a universal remote.

TS3005b.C,"i'll go first . i'll go first i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . when you press a button , that's when you do pr when you want to turn up the volume , little connection is made on a little print plate the chip makes a morse code like signal which then is si signalled to several transistors and that makes the infra red lights signal which is sent to the television set . the findings that i found searching up some detailed information about the remote controls , are that they are very easy to produce , it's possible to make them in mass production and the technology's already available , made a little animation of about how a tran our remote controller works . the sub component , i suppose that you understand what a sub component is , is f in this example it's the button . when it is pressed down , the switch is ter is is switched on , with the wire is sent to the chip in co operation with the battery wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control . it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , personally pref prefer that it would be p come available in the various colours , and easy to use buttons . perhaps soft touch , touch screen buttons because the rubber buttons are always they slightly they can be slightly damaged , the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore . and as i said before th we can make several designs . standby options , but all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to to get but that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . a touch screen probably even more . perhaps we should focus on that l_c_d_ screen . if you wanted the minimal use b buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p press them down , just like a touch screen . that they will send you some information about the cost of l_c_d_ screens . if you you receive an email about that , can you post it in the but in a sub menu like that . think it's also important to make it possible to how do you call it in english , to not use batteries , and go to standby mode when you don't use it , it should be standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . just a cable , or a even a a charger where you can mount it on . something like that , functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , make it possible to not display button at ten points certain systems already exist , it should be done . if it could be done , should be done . colours the main colour of the remote control is the colour of the l_c_d_ screen . make it available in different colours , because when you touch the l_c_d_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . it looks a lot more fancy if you use if you don't have any buttons on the s on remote control .

TS3005b.D,"we're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , the methods i prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five years are more interested in fj features like l_c_d_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . we don't have to make it very small , like like a mobile phone seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex remote control has to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , those they those have to h be find very easily . buttons . like what all colleagues said , have to be minimalized . or in l_c_d_ screen . because we have the l_c_d_ screen , we have the various options . but an l_c_d_ screen , the problem with the l_ sc l_c_d_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the l_c_d_ screen a lot . we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement l_c_d_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . and the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . we have to keep in mind to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . but like i said , l_c_d_ screen is easily to use and it should be easy to use . especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , it's easy to implement a button with a s what which especially do that , because some t_v_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's not relaxed younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in l_c_d_ screen . you don't know how much it costs , the l_c_d_ screen . i don't have any costs here , it's the most easier thing , but our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . but market share fro for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then we should be sticking to rubber buttons . it'll look fancy with l_c_d_ screen . only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . the most important things on a f on an remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power s power usage . and a teletext , but that is not of the question . and other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , power supply is one of the most important things . because i don't think people will like it who that you have to turn it on first and then use it , think it's better when th the t_v_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . of put it in a recharger . charger . that this should be standard . large button large buttons . also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . an l_c_d_ screen should be suf sufficient . it's better to have l_ l_c_d_ screen , if the costs al allow it . but that should also be with f should be also with l_c_d_ screen . curved ? we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub menus . we could check the other remote controls with technical functions . wide screen , high screen , different things you have , it should be available , but then in separate screen settings channel settings . or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . you only have channel button or volume button . only the on and o on and off button .

TS3005c.C,"components design , first of all i've subtracted some of the components that is that are used are w from what the remote control's formed . first of all , the case , the surrounding of the remote control . the case was is made from rubber , i suppose . because when you use a remote control a lot of people will drop their remote control the titanium was also an option . but it's a very expensive material . rubber is , the best suitable material to use for our it's poss it's also possible to create fancy colours with rubber . titanium you have to paint it and with that it's possible to scratch it h i had an idea single covered curved , single curved . it's t two dimensional . it's it's best to draw of an idea like this . it also looks when it's on your table . it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands . the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already . thought about the l_c_d_ touch screen , and it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . this should be our button component . the batteries , we also thought about that already , will be chargeable with an option for a mount station and they should be long lasting , not not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition there should be some more investigation on that side . my personal preferences i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours . they are rather boring for for use with rubber . we could make a little r_ and r_ on the top of the machine . i suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in a lot of possible colours , it's possible to make very fancy remote controls as i said before rubber is is impossible to damage severely but i if you drop it's not broken right away s instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium . changing just the shape of the remote control ? round corners , but s but square , soft rubber . and the l_c_d_ screen was rather small . but it should be larger . three quarters . but if yo if you make the l_c_d_ screen as large as the remote control itself , you'll always get some because if you lose the pen you can't use the docking station . chip on print with a simple sim not a simple but a chip on print , what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it's always clear for the remote control when you press certain button . but when you got a l_c_d_ screen , with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place , but it the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume . it has to have some calculation unit or c_p_u_ and the case , we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber hard rubber and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ? got a single curved rubber if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . we'll leave that to the usability engineering then . not how much n not how often it's used , but it does it doesn't really matter , you can make a very sensitive microphone , but that's not import that's not im very important but it doesn't makes it any more fancy because you get to see interface type . you get w when you use the settings menu to look up some some channels on your on your television , you should scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . then it's very handy to scroll down , what's the standard colour ? but if you use silver , rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .

TS3008d.A,"welcome to the detailed design meeting . we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . did we want to have a m mute button ? there are different ways for remote controls to do like i call it teens and twenties . but do we have do we need extra buttons , but you don't actually need them , becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds i know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , you can still select the twenty number in the twenty or in the ten . when you put a button on it with like one and then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , when you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . but you don't underst you don't understand my point . that special but button you're talking about , that's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv t_v_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu you can still put another number on it . when you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . that's the same thing as the button with the one and it i know for that some televisions that w th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . we'll apply them then for now . app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . but i still it all t_v_s in some ways support it , it's more c is m we don't we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but there's more to in than wha than what you just said . let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because we have to consider the docking station anyway , because we have some cost issues still to come . because we're gonna use one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . but and we have to agree upon the exact colours , it really depends on taste . but we d we didn't we're not planning to use fronts , i believe . let that let's make that a one . it's something we really put work into . two , because of the menu button t two . but i do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . the rubber or seven let's leave it open for for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . more through like function t_v_ functionalities and think about it la later on definitely . a two . you can put that on the side if we would like to . and i will i th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . make it a two . which is quite a great score . i received spreadsheet . i'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , first of all , the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . we include one battery . we indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . we should know how many simple chips , regular chips you can look it up right now . but it will it will be lot of problems . we went for the double curved case made out of plastic and rubber . and with a special colour . we we have special colours . then the push button , i was just counting them . you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use , that's bit of a problem , because i re but i really don't understand that , because imagine a remote control with far more push buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet . and plus these two , f plus the mute button , and it's will be eighteen . i don't understand . let's make it just one . but then still , when we there's no room for a docking station we'll give the buttons special colour . we'll give them a special form . because the buttons will be will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , but the problem now is that the there's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . you can find it in your email right now , but when we skip when we when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still we need something else to make it special , you can look at it for s presentation .

TS3011b.B,"the function of remote control is to send messages to the television set . then i found two different remote controls , the multi function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling i already mentioned in the previous discussion . and the ease of use remote control with the less p possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons . but my in my opinion , the easy to use r_c_ is the best possi possibility for us . the glow in the dark concept we discussed . if we use the leds , i does it use much more energy it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in the device that shines on all the buttons , but not for each button one led , i'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? another device is not a solution . but t_v_s don't have all buttons . but we can have just home stat a base station next to the t_v_ . just a little antenna i don't think people would bother walking to the t_v_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . just a base station next to the t_v_ is the best possibility . and do we even prefer the sound above the leds , the lightning function ? just through the easy design . we can make design when there's not mu much buttons in it . it's just an easy way of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . instead of a stick . just a round button should be the trick , i wouldn't buy it personally . a remote control without the ten digits . then we should just take a look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition . ",The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. 
TS3011b.C,"and the m most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to a t_v_ set . there's a energy source here . the user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using infrared light , it's almost every piece of equipment every piece of every t_v_ set is controlled infrared . and the more luxury remote controls have lithium buttons . we should consider that . personally we should infra use infrared , because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every t_v_ set . another important point is we really should use energy sparse , friendly components . for cost effectiveness , we should really use a very low cost circuit board , and the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques , blinking leds and all that fancy they're p f power friendly leds also . no , they're they're a little bit more expensive , there's no elaborate technique used in this equipment . and your t_v_ set starts to make a weird sound , because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and perform a some and then the remote control reports itself , but that will be very costly , but before i do that i w i want to warn you that by implementing this function the technical design will become more complicated  we should save costs by not implementing a lot of functions it's more important to make the make it look like a very friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by these kinds of sticks like that . i don't know if it's user friendly . but if you're regular t_v_ user , and you just want to watch the dutch television networks , you can you can use about ten buttons . that's enough . but these ten buttons look a bit dull . you can experiment by with shape or with size or with colour , that thing . it can be combined with the find the remote control . when you add speech recognition to your remote control , it's very easy to change the channel . that's one thing . but i'm afraid it will be a bit costly . we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . there are some hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . it's very cheap . it's just a case with two metal contacts . we've decided to implement a seemingly easy design . but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . but there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing speech techniques , voice recognition , that these kinds of things . if we just add chip which does the voice recognition , our circuit board will become even more cheap . we drop the voice recognition ? ","The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design. "

The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design. After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1).
