Bdb001.A,"Oh , I remember seeing an example of this .  Yeah .  Mmm .  So you 're essentially defining a lattice .  Yeah .  How - how  Oh , that 's  That 's actually very nicely handled here  because you could you could all you 'd have to change is the , um , time - stamps in the time - line without without , uh , changing the I Ds .  Except the time - line is gonna be huge .  If you say  suppose you have a phone - level alignment .  You 'd have you 'd have  Why  Mmm .  But but why not use it for phone - level ?  It 's just a matter of it 's just a matter of it being bigger .  But if you have  you know , barring memory limitations , or uh I w I mean this is still the m  Oh , no .  You would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone - level information , I 'd imagine .  You  Mm - hmm .  Or you just compre  I mean , I like text formats .  Um ,  b you can always , uh , G - zip them ,  and , um , you know , c decompress them on the fly if y if space is really a concern .  Right ,  OK .  I would say  OK , so frame - level is probably not a good idea .  But for phone - level stuff it 's perfectly  Like phones , or syllables , or anything like that .  But but but most of the frames are actually not speech .  So ,  you know , people don't  v Look at it , words times the average The average number of phones in an English word is , I don't know , five maybe ?  So , look at it , t number of words times five .  That 's not that not  Exactly .  Yeah .  I mean , I 've I 've used them .  I don't know what their structure is .  I 've forgot what the str  Hmm .  Yeah ,  th we have  Actually , we we use a generalization of the the Sphere format .  Um ,  but  Yeah , so there is something like that  but it 's , um , probably not as sophist  They ha it has its own  I mean , Entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , S - SD or some so SF or something like that .  Hmm ?  Right .  Mmm .  Do they already have tools ?  As long as uh each tag is on one line .  Hmm .  If we want to  Do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ?  We should we should find out .  It 's a hassle  if  I I think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , I mean , it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that  It seems to me you want to keep the frame - level stuff separate .  And then  Now now how would you how would you represent , um , multiple speakers in this framework ?  Were You would just represent them as  You would have like a speaker tag or something ?  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Is i ?  Well , channel or speaker or whatever .  It doesn't  Right .  But but so how in the NIST format do we express a hierarchical relationship between , um , say , an utterance and the words within it ?  So how do you tell that these are the words that belong to that utterance ?  Mm - hmm .  OK .  So  So here 's the thing .  Um  Hhh .  Well , the thing  the thing is that some something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose .  So f  s  Um ,  well ,  s let 's let 's ta so let 's  so  y So for instance @ @ sup  Suppose you have a word sequence  and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence .  f Say , one segmentation is in terms of , um , you know , uh , sentences .  And another segmentation is in terms of , um , I don't know , prosodic phrases .  And let 's say that they don't nest .  So , you know , a prosodic phrase may cross two sentences or something .  I don't know if that 's true or not  but let 's as  Right .  Yeah .  So , you want to be s you want to say this this word is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase .  But the phrase is not part of the sentence  and neither is the sentence part of the phrase .  So , you would have to have two different pointers from the word up one level up ,  one to the sent  Right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  The the o the other issue that you had was , how do you actually efficiently extract , um find and extract information in a structure of this type ?  So you gave some examples like  No , that 's not clear .  I mean , yeah , you c sure you can do it ,  but can you do it sort of l l you know , it  y y you gotta you gotta do this you you 're gonna want to do this very quickly  or else you 'll spend all your time sort of searching through very complex data structures  Yeah .  You want sort of a grep that 's that works at the structural on the structural representation .  Yeah , but it 's it 's not clear that that 's  ","So you 're essentially defining a lattice .  That 's actually very nicely handled here  because you could you could all you 'd have to change is the , um , time - stamps in the time - line without without , uh , changing the I Ds .

Bdb001.A,"That 's relative to the structure of the XML document ,  not to the structure of what you 're representing in the document .  Right .  Right .  Be  Because here you 're specifying a lattice .  So the underlying that 's the underlying data structure .  And you want to be able to search in that lattice .  That 's different from searching through the text .  Um  Hhh .  Hmm .  But  Hmm .  But this is  I I 'm still , um , not convinced that you can do much at all on the text on the flat file that that you know , the text representation .  e  Because the text representation is gonna be , uh , not reflecting the structure of of your words and annotations .  It 's just it 's  No .  You you have to  what you have to do is you have to basically  Y yeah . You can use Perl to read it in and construct a internal representation that is essentially a lattice .  But , the  and then  Right .  But that 's what you 'll have to do .  Bec - be  Oh , maybe  um  Well  Ma  well , maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you 'll you 'll be dealing with ,  because , um , you know , Adam might have one opinion but you might have another ,  so  I think the more eyes look at this the better .  Mmm .  Is there an is there an IP - API ?  OK .  There used to be a problem that they get too large ,  and so basically the uh the filesystem wouldn't  Maybe you could extend the API to , uh , support , uh , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk  so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f  Yeah .  OK .  What does the P stand for anyway ?  No , P - files were around way before Quicknet .  P - files were were around when w with , um , RAP .  Right ?  You worked with P - files .  I worked with P - files .  No .  Yeah .  j I think there 's  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Um ,  it would be nice  um ,  eh , gr this is sort of r regarding uh , uh it 's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion ,  but , when it comes to annotations , um , you often find yourself in the situation where you have different annotations of the same , say , word sequence .  OK ?  And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other .  So , once this data gets out there , some people might start annotating this for , I don't know , dialogue acts or , um , you know , topics or what the heck .  You know ,  there 's a zillion things that people might annotate this for .  And the only thing that is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence ,  or approximately .  Or the times .  But , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you don't necessarily want to or topics you don't really want to be dealing with time - marks .  You 'd it 's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence , right ?  I mean , most people aren't as sophisticated as as we are here with , you know , uh , time alignments and stuff .  So  So the the the point is  Right .  So ,  um ,  the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with , uh , word sequences that are differently annotated .  And you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version .  OK ?  Um , and we had this problem very massively , uh , at SRI when we worked , uh , a while back on , uh well , on dialogue acts as well as , uh , you know ,  um , what was it ?  uh ,  utterance types .  There 's , uh , automatic , uh , punctuation and stuff like that .  Because we had one set of annotations that were based on , uh , one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation ,  and then we had another version that was based on , uh , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation .  So , we had these two different versions which were you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical .  So it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations .  No .  No .  But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , um , that mediates between various versions ,  and uh , sort of like th uh , you know , you have this thing in UNIX where you have , uh , diff .  There 's the , uh , diff that actually tries to reconcile different two diffs f based on the same original .  Something like that ,  um , but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this uh , this annotation format .  So  So somewhere in the API you would like to have like a merge or some some function that merges two two versions .  Right .  Is  Exactly .  Right .  ","but , when it comes to annotations , um , you often find yourself in the situation where you have different annotations of the same , say , word sequence .  And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other .  But , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you don't necessarily want to or topics you don't really want to be dealing with time - marks .  And you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version .  But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , um , that mediates between various versions ,  ",
Bdb001.A,"So so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by , uh , doing uh , by doing Hhh .  Both were based on words ,  so , bo we have two versions of the same words intersp you know , sprinkled with with different tags for annotations .  And we did diff .  Exactly !  And that 's how  Yeah .  But , you know , it had lots of errors  and things would end up in the wrong order , and so forth .  Uh ,  so ,  um , if you had a more  Uh ,  it it was a kluge  because it was basically reducing everything to uh , to uh , uh , to textual alignment .  Um ,  so  And you 're gonna get that  because if the data gets out , people will do all kinds of things to it .  And , uh , s you know , several years from now you might want to look into , um , the prosody of referring expressions .  And someone at the university of who knows where has annotated the referring expressions .  So you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data .  OK ?  Yeah .  Right .  Time time times are ephemeral .  Um  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Or she .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Ah , well .  For th for the for the benefit of science we 'll read the digits .  ",,
Bdb001.B,"Channel two .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Hmm .  True .  I 've used the P - file , I think .  I 've looked at it at least , briefly , I think when we were doing s something .  Oh , in there .  Where are those annotations coming from ?  ",,
Bdb001.C,"Yeah , we had a long discussion about how much w how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out .  So  Morgan wants to make it hard .  Did did did it ?  I didn't even check yesterday whether it was moving .  So .  Channel three ?  Channel three ?  Mm - hmm ?  Yeah ,  it has a little indicator on it on the AF .  Yep .  Test .  What ?  Did you see Hannibal recently or something ?  Yeah .  Yeah , I 'm I 'm familiar with that .  I mean , we I sort of already have developed an XML format for this sort of stuff .  And so the only question is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not ?  Have you looked at that ?  I mean , I had a web page up .  So  You mean , this  I guess I am gonna be standing up and drawing on the board .  Um , so so it definitely had that as a concept .  So tha it has a single time - line ,  and then you can have lots of different sections ,  each of which have I Ds attached to it ,  and then you can refer from other sections to those I Ds ,  if you want to .  So that ,  um  so that you start with with a time - line tag .  "" Time - line "" .  And then you have a bunch of times .  I don't e I don't remember exactly what my notation was ,  but it  Yeah ,  "" T equals one point three two "" ,  uh  And then I I also had optional things like accuracy ,  and then "" ID equals T one , uh , one seven "" .  And then , I also wanted to to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp .  Yeah , so these are arbitrary , assigned by a program ,  not not by a user .  So you have a whole bunch of those .  And then somewhere la further down you might have something like an utterance tag  which has "" start equals T - seventeen ,  end equals T - eighteen "" .  So what that 's saying is , we know it starts at this particular time .  We don't know when it ends .  Right ?  But it ends at this T - eighteen ,  which may be somewhere else .  We say there 's another utterance .  We don't know what the t time actually is  but we know that it 's the same time as this end time .  You know , thirty - eight ,  whatever you want .  OK .  Yes ,  exactly .  And then , uh and then these also have I Ds .  Right ?  So you could you could have some sort of other other tag later in the file that would be something like , um , oh , I don't know , uh , "" noise - type equals door - slam "" .  You know ?  And then , uh , you could either say "" time equals a particular time - mark "" or you could do other sorts of references .  So or or you might have a prosody  "" Prosody ""  right ? D ? T ?  D ? T ?  T ?  You like the D ?  That 's a good D .  Um ,  you know , so you could have some sort of type here ,  and then you could have ,  um  the utterance that it 's referring to could be U - seventeen or something like that .  Oh , well .  Right .  That 's , the who that 's why you do that extra level of indirection .  So that you can just change the time - line .  Yes .  Yeah , this  I don't think I would do this for phone - level .  I think for phone - level you want to use some sort of binary representation  because it 'll be too dense otherwise .  I would use just an existing an existing way of doing it .  It 's parsing limitations .  I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for .  Right .  I mean , you 'd y  I I am imagining you 'd have multiple versions of this depending on the information that you want .  Um ,  I 'm just  what I 'm wondering is whether  I think for word - level , this would be OK .  For word - level , it 's alright .  For lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that I just I don't know .  I don't know if that  Yeah , I mean , for something like that I would use P - file  or or any frame - level stuff I would use P - file .  Uh , that 's a well , or something like it .  It 's ICS uh , ICSI has a format for frame - level representation of features .  Um .  Right .  Right .  Or or there 's a there 's a particular way in XML to refer to external resources .  So you would say "" refer to this external file "" .  Um ,  so that external file wouldn't be in  More compact ,  which I think is is better .  I mean , if you did it at this  You don't want to do it with that  Anything at frame - level you had better encode binary  or it 's gonna be really painful .  Well , but if you 're talking about one per frame , you 're talking about gigabyte - size files .  ","I mean , we I sort of already have developed an XML format for this sort of stuff .  So tha it has a single time - line ,  And then you have a bunch of times .  And then , I also wanted to to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp .

Bdb001.C,"You 're gonna actually run out of space in your filesystem for one file .  Right ?  Because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most O Ss .  Yep .  So I think it it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing .  But I think , a anything at frame - level , even P - file , is too verbose .  I would use something tighter than P - files .  So .  It 's whatever you want , actually .  So that what 's nice about the P - file It i  Built into it is the concept of frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure .  And then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values .  And it can take different types .  So it th they don't all have to be floats .  You know , you can have integers and you can have doubles , and all that sort of stuff .  Um .  Right ?  And it has a header it has a header format that describes it to some extent .  So ,  the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file ,  even though they 're always sequential .  And so it does waste a lot of space .  But it 's still a lot tighter than than ASCII .  And we have a lot of tools already to deal with it .  Yeah ,  there 's a ton of it .  Man - pages and , uh , source code , and me .  Yeah , it 's not standard .  I mean , it 's something that we developed at ICSI .  But , uh  But it 's been used here  and and , you know , we have a well - configured system that you can distribute for free ,  and  Well , what does H T K do for features ?  Or does it even have a concept of features ?  I 'm just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ?  They generate their own .  Ah , right .  Right .  And a and again , if you have a  if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna  Yeah , I mean , they 'd be emo enormous .  Right .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah , the other thing  We should look at ATLAS ,  the NIST thing ,  and see if they have anything at that level .  I mean , I 'm not sure what to do about this with ATLAS ,  because they chose a different route .  I chose something that  Th - there are sort of two choices .  Your your file format can know about know that you 're talking about language and speech , which is what I chose , and time ,  or your file format can just be a graph representation .  And then the application has to impose the structure on top .  So what it looked like ATLAS chose is , they chose the other way ,  which was their file format is just nodes and links ,  and you have to interpret what they mean yourself .  Uh , because I knew that we were doing speech ,  and I thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be t for the tags to say "" it 's an utterance "" , as opposed to the tag to say "" it 's a link "" .  So , but  Yeah ,  they 're reasonably compatible .  Yep .  So ,  well , the other thing is if we choose to use ATLAS , which maybe we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it .  Yeah .  Yeah .  The only thing  Yeah .  I mean , I I chose this for a couple reasons .  One of them is that it 's easy to parse .  You don't need a full XML parser .  It 's very easy to just write a Perl script to parse it .  Exactly .  Exactly .  Which I always do .  Well , I have it structured .  Right ?  So each type tag has only particular items that it can take .  Sure .  If you have more information .  So what What NIST would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like "" link start equals , um , you know , some node ID ,  end equals some other node ID "" ,  and then "" type "" would be "" utterance "" .  You know , so it 's very similar .  Write a translator .  But it se  Since they are developing a big  they 're developing a big infrastructure .  And so it seems to me that if if we want to use that , we might as well go directly to what they 're doing , rather than  The I looked at it  The last time I looked at it was a while ago ,  probably a year ago ,  uh , when we first started talking about this .  And at that time at least it was still not very complete .  And so , specifically they didn't have any external format representation at that time .  They just had the sort of conceptual node uh , annotated transcription graph ,  which I really liked .  And that 's exactly what this stuff is based on .  Since then , they 've developed their own external file format ,  which is , uh , you know , this sort of s this sort of thing .  Um , and apparently they 've also developed a lot of tools ,  but I haven't looked at them .  Maybe I should .  ","Because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most O Ss .

The respective frame-level representation can be handled by P-files, a technology developed at ICSI, which also comes with a library of tools. Two main options were discussed as to the organisation of the collected data. On the other hand, the ATLAS (NIST) technology offers a very similar, but more generic organisational scheme based on nodes and links. Its advantages are that it is easier to read, parse, map onto the Transcriber format and to expand with extra features. These are labeled with domain specific types, like ""utterance"" or ""speaker"". This option offer well-developed infrastructure and flexibility as to the type of data storage (flat XML files or relational database). "
Bdb001.C,"Um , th what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail  that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other .  Yeah , we might as well .  Yep .  So I 'll I 'll take a closer look at it .  And  Right .  The  Yep .  The other thing the other way that I sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the Transcriber format .  Um ,  but  Yep .  It 's almost the same .  The the the the point is with this , though , is that you can't really add any supplementary information .  Right ?  So if you suddenly decide that you want  Yeah .  You 'd have to make a different type .  Right .  Right .  Yep .  Right .  Right .  Huge .  Um ,  there 's a spea speaker tag up at the top which identifies them  and then each utt  the way I had it is each turn or each utterance , I don't even remember now , had a speaker ID tag attached to it .  And in this format you would have a different tag ,  which which would , uh , be linked to the link .  So so somewhere else you would have another thing that would be ,  um  Let 's see , would it be a node or a link ?  Um  And so so this one would have , um , an ID is link link seventy - four or something like that .  And then somewhere up here you would have a link that that , uh , you know , was referencing L - seventy - four and had speaker Adam .  You know ,  or something like that .  This isn't quite right .  I have to look at it again .  Um , you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they 're all belonging to this ID .  Right .  And then each utterance could refer to a turn ,  and each turn could refer to something higher up .  Well , that 's why I didn't call it "" sentence "" .  Yeah .  Sure .  I mean , so you would you would have yet another tag .  You 'd have another tag which says this is of type "" sentence "" .  And ,  what  Right .  You would have another tag somewhere .  It 's well , there 're two ways of doing it .  You could have some sort of link type  type equals "" sentence "" ,  and ID is "" S - whatever "" .  And then lower down you could have an utterance .  So the type is "" utterance "" equals "" utt "" .  And you could either say that  No .  I don't know  I take that back .  Can you can you say that this is part of this ,  or do you say this is part of this ?  I think  So  Right .  Well , I think I 'm I think w I had better look at it again  because I I 'm  There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection that I 'm forgetting .  Right .  I I 'm pretty sure that you can do that ,  but I 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting .  So so what you would end up having is a tag saying "" here 's a word ,  and it starts here and it ends here "" .  And then lower down you would say "" here 's a prosodic boundary  and it has these words in it "" .  And lower down you 'd have "" here 's a sentence ,  and it has these words in it "" .  Yep .  So I think that 's that would wor  Let me look at it again .  So .  Well  Right .  I mean , that 's gonna be  Is the rising pitch a feature ,  or is it gonna be in the same file ?  But the  I mean , that 's gonna be hard regardless ,  right ?  Because you 're gonna have to write a program that goes through your feature file and looks for rising pitches .  OK .  Well , in that case you would add that to this format  r  Right .  You have that .  There 's a standard again in XML , specifically for searching XML documents structured X - XML documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position .  You use it as a tool .  You use it as a tool ,  not an end - user .  It 's not an end - user thing .  It 's it 's you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search .  It 's a graph ,  but  Well ,  no , no , no .  The whole point is that the text and the lattice are isomorphic .  They represent each other completely .  So that  I mean th  Yeah , but that 's gonna be the trouble no matter what .  Right ?  No matter what format you choose , you 're gonna have the trou you 're gonna have the difficulty of relating the the frame - level features  Yep .  Right .  Transfer .  The , uh  One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they 're trying to define an API which is independent of the back store ,  so that , uh , you could define a single API and the the storage could be flat XML files or a database .  My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , um , just a flat file and , uh , search tools I bet will be enough .  ","Um , th what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail  So I 'll I 'll take a closer look at it .  The other thing the other way that I sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the Transcriber format .  The the the the point is with this , though , is that you can't really add any supplementary information .  there 's a spea speaker tag up at the top which identifies them  the way I had it is each turn or each utterance , I don't even remember now , had a speaker ID tag attached to it .  Um , you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they 're all belonging to this ID .  Well , I think I 'm I think w I had better look at it again  I I 'm pretty sure that you can do that ,  but I 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting .  There 's a standard again in XML , specifically for searching XML documents structured X - XML documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position .  It 's it 's you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search .  No matter what format you choose , you 're gonna have the trou you 're gonna have the difficulty of relating the the frame - level features  One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they 're trying to define an API which is independent of the back store ,  so that , uh , you could define a single API and the the storage could be flat XML files or a database .  My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , um , just a flat file and , uh , search tools I bet will be enough .  ","Its advantages are that it is easier to read, parse, map onto the Transcriber format and to expand with extra features. XML standards offer libraries that can be used for the development of search tools. This option offer well-developed infrastructure and flexibility as to the type of data storage (flat XML files or relational database). "
Bdb001.C,"But that 's the advantage of ATLAS , is that if we actually take decide to go that route completely and we program to their API , then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy .  Yep .  I guess I 'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the the whole framework that that NIST is talking about , with ATLAS and a database and all that sort of stuff ,  cuz it 's a big learning curve , just to get going .  Whereas if we just do a flat file format , sure , it may not be as efficient  but everyone can program in Perl and and use it .  Right ?  So , as opposed to  Well , if it 's not representing it , then how do you recover it ?  Of course it 's representing it .  That 's the whole point .  OK .  Well , that was a different point .  Right ?  So what I was saying is that  For Perl if you want to just do Perl .  If you wanted to use the structured XML query language , that 's a different thing .  And it 's a set of tools that let you specify given the D - DDT DTD of the document , um , what sorts of structural searches you want to do .  So you want to say that , you know , you 're looking for , um , a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it , um , and , uh , refers to a particular value .  And so the point isn't that an end - user , who is looking for a query like you specified , wouldn't program it in this language .  What you would do is , someone would build a tool that used that as a library .  So that they so that you wouldn't have to construct the internal representations yourself .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  I think that there are quick and dirty solutions ,  and then there are long - term , big - infrastructure solutions .  And so we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both .  Um  Right .  And so it seems to me that  I mean , I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,  but if we use the ATLAS external file representation , um , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as I said in Perl ,  and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole ATLAS inter infrastructure ,  which has all that built in .  Sure .  Well , I wouldn't wait for the formats , because anything you pick we 'll be able to translate to another form .  Hi , Jane .  Can you  Oh , well .  Sure .  We 're about done .  Well , I think the other thing we might want to look at is alternatives to P - file .  I mean , th the reason I like P - file is I 'm already familiar with it ,  we have expertise here ,  and so if we pick something else , there 's the learning - curve problem .  But , I mean , it is just something we developed at ICSI .  And so  Yeah .  There 's an API for it .  And , uh ,  a bunch of libraries , P - file utilities .  Well , that 's gonna be a problem no matter what .  You have the two - gigabyte limit on the filesystem size .  And we definitely hit that with Broadcast News .  Yep .  Most of the tools can handle that .  So that  we didn't do it at the API - level .  We did it at the t tool - level .  That that most many of them can s you can specify several P - files  and they 'll just be done sequentially .  So .  Sure .  I mean , if you do "" man P - file "" or "" apropos P - file "" , you 'll see a lot .  I have no idea .  I didn't de I didn't develop it .  You know , it was I think it was Dave Johnson .  So it 's all part of the Quicknet library .  It has all the utilities for it .  Oh , were they ?  Mm - hmm .  But there are ni they 're  The Quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle P - files ,  so it works pretty well .  Neither do I .  It 's a Phil file ?  Yeah , I 've been meaning to look at the ATLAS stuff again anyway .  So , just keep  Yeah , I think it it w  And , w uh , as I said , I what I did with this stuff I based it on theirs .  It 's just they hadn't actually come up with an external format yet .  So now that they have come up with a format , it doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it .  But let me look at it again .  As I said , that  There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection  and I 'm just blanking on exactly how it works .  I gotta look at it again .  Yeah , I 've seen it .  Yep .  Easy easy to map .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Well , I mean , is that  I mean , it doesn't .  I mean , that not for the topic of this meeting .

Yeah .  Diff .  Yep .  Yep .  There 's actually a diff library you can use to do things like that that so you have different formats .  Yeah , I think it 's gonna be very hard .  Any sort of structured anything when you try to merge is really , really hard  because you ha i  The hard part isn't the file format .  The hard part is specifying what you mean by "" merge "" .

Or she .  Sure .  But what if what if they change the words ?  Sure .  But they could have changed it a little .  The the point is , that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript ,  so how do you merge it back in ?  I understand what you 're saying .  And I I guess the answer is , um , it 's gonna be different every time .  It 's j it 's just gonna be  I it 's exactly what I said before ,  which is that "" what do you mean by "" merge "" ? ""  So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times , well , what do you mean by "" merge "" ?  If you tell me what you mean , I can write a program to do it .  Right .  And that 's about all you can do .  So so in so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences ,  extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours ,  and use that .  Right .  Right ,  exactly .

Bdb001.E,"Are you talking about the overlap a annotations ?  Yeah .  So what I was imagining was um , so Dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons .  And so put , uh , a a green ribbon on for an overlap code .  And since we w we  I I think it 's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now .  And so it 's nice to have  However , you know , you want to have it , uh , time time uh , located in the discourse .

It won't it 'll be independent of the time bins ,  however these e evolve , shrink , or whatever ,  increase ,  or  Also , you could have different time bins for different purposes .  And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique , uh , you know , anchored , clear .  And it would just end up on a separate ribbon .  So the overlap coding is gonna be easy with respect to that .  You look puzzled .  OK .  What , the codes themselves ?  Or the ?  Well , we don't have to go into the codes .  We don't have to go into the codes .  But let me just  No .  W the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon ,  you know ,  and and and let 's say that this is a time bin .

Exactly .  It 's very disconcerting .  OK .  So , um ,  I was gonna try to get out of here , like , in half an hour ,  um ,  cuz I really appreciate people coming ,  and the main thing that I was gonna ask people to help with today is to give input on what kinds of database format we should use in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts ,  so anything that transcribers or discourse coders or whatever put in the signal , with time - marks for , like , words and phone boundaries and all the stuff we get out of the forced alignments and the recognizer .

So ,  I actually mostly need to be able to link up , or  I it 's it 's a question both of what the representation is and  OK ,  yeah .  So you should , definitely .  Mm - hmm .  Right ,  right .  Right .  OK .  It 's an O instead of an I ,  but the D is good .  Yeah .  OK .  So ,  I mean , that seems that seems g great for all of the encoding of things with time  and ,  um  I I guess my question is more , uh , what d what do you do with , say , a forced alignment ?  I mean you 've got all these phone labels ,  and what do you do if you just conceptually , if you get , um , transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing , cuz you 've got a new recognition output ,  or s sort of what 's the , um , sequence of going from the waveforms that stay the same , the transcripts that may or may not change , and then the utterance which where the time boundaries that may or may not change ?  Um .  And you 'd be able to propagate all of the the information ?  Yeah ,  yeah , especially at the phone - level .  The we we have phone - level backtraces .  Um  OK .  So , if you were doing that and you had this sort of companion , uh , thing that gets called up for phone - level , uh , what would that look like ?  How would you ?  H h  So you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your in your XML or something .  Um ,  cuz th it does get very bush with  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Definitely .  I mean , we actually have  So , one thing that Don is doing , is we 're we 're running For every frame , you get a pitch value ,  and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values  depending on  Meaning ?  OK .  That you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an ID .  And  OK .  So that might that might work .  I mean these are long meetings  and with for every frame ,  um  These are big files .  These are really  I mean  And th it 's  Phones are every five frames though ,  so .  Or something like that .  Yeah ,  but we actually  Oh , so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the  long pause phones .  Yeah .  OK .  That 's true .  But you do have to keep them in there .  Y yeah .  OK .  OK .  So  Do you Are you familiar with it ?  I haven't seen this particular format ,  but  OK .  Oh .  So that that sounds that sounds about what I w  You do ?  OK .  Is there some documentation on this somewhere ?  OK ,  great .  So ,  I mean , that sounds good .

But it 's been used here  and people 've  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Th - this is exactly the kind of decision It 's just whatever  Actually , I I just you know , we we 've done this stuff on prosodics  and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files ,  and we just have an ASCII , uh , output of frame - by - frame .  Which is fine ,  but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files .  I mean , we could do it .  I was just thinking if there 's something that where all the frame values are  Hmm ?  They 're they 're fair they 're quite large .  And these are for ten - minute Switchboard conversations ,  and  So it 's doable ,  it 's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame - by - frame  and it doesn't have any kind of ,  um  I I don't know enough about what we 're gonna do with the data .

Bdb001.F,"And just , I mean we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do .

But ,  I suppose that as long as they have a type here that specifies "" utt "" ,  um ,  it 's yeah , close enough that  You have to make a different type .

Um ,  and then from the recognition side we have backtraces at the phone - level .  If if it can handle that , it could handle states or whatever .  And then at the prosody - level we have frame sort of like cepstral feature files ,  uh , like these P - files or anything like that .  And that 's sort of the world of things that I  And then we have the aligned channels , of course ,  and  Yeah .  I I definitely agree  and I wanted to find actually a f a nicer format or a maybe a more compact format than what we used before .

Actually , it 's the channel , I think , that  I mean , w  yeah , channel is what the channelized output out  Yeah , but  And what if you actually have  So right now what you have as utterance , um , the closest thing that comes out of the channelized is the stuff between the segment boundaries that the transcribers put in or that Thilo put in ,  which may or may not actually be , like , a s it 's usually not um , the beginning and end of a sentence , say .  So ,  right .  Um , so it 's like a segment or something .  So ,  I mean , I assume this is possible , that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe , you can say , you know , from for from the c beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence , from the annotations , this is a unit ,  even though it never actually  i It 's only a unit by virtue of the annotations at the word - level .

That 's what I exactly what I meant by the utterances versus the sentence could be sort of  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  An - Right .  So you would be able to go in and say , you know , "" give me all the words in the bound in the prosodic phrase  and give me all the words in the ""  Yeah .  Um , OK .  OK .  That 's good .

So i if it  I I mean , I can't do it ,  but I can  um ,  Right .  You 'd need a p sort of a paradigm for how to do it .  But an example would be "" find all the cases in which Adam started to talk while Andreas was talking and his pitch was rising ,  Andreas 's pitch "" .  That kind of thing .  Well , the rising pitch will never be hand - annotated .  So the all the prosodic features are going to be automatically  So they 're gonna be in those  So  Right .  So normally what we would do is we would say "" what do we wanna assign rising pitch to ? ""  Are we gonna assign it to words ?  Are we gonna just assign it to sort of  when it 's rising we have a begin - end rise representation ?  But suppose we dump out this file  and we say , uh , for every word we just classify it as , w you know , rise or fall or neither ?  OK .

And so that might be  I mean , it 'd be good for us to know to use a format where we know we can easily , um , input that to some database if other people are using it .  Something like that .  So  OK .  Is a  See , I think the kinds of questions , at least in the next to the end of this year , are there may be a lot of different ones ,  but they 'll all have a similar nature .  They 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , uh , an a value ,  like a continuous value ,  like the slope of something .  But  you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh , either at the word - level or at the segment - level ,  or or something like that .  They 're not gonna be at the phone - level and they 're no not gonna be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things .  And so the main thing is just being able  Well , I guess , the two goals .  Um , one that Chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over , that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions ,  and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there .  And that would that would do it ,  I mean , for me .  In the between ,  right .  And especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away ,  even if your tools change .  Yeah .  I mean , that sounds good to me .  I I don't  So  if if you would l look at that and let us know what you think .  I mean , I think we 're sort of guinea pigs ,  cuz I I want to get the prosody work done  but I don't want to waste time , you know , getting the  Yeah ?  OK .  Yeah , definitely .  Especially if there 's , e um you know , if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right  Oh , hi .  the right representation ,  then , i you know , I hope it won't  We don't actually need the whole full - blown thing to be ready ,  so .  Um ,  ","So we would basically be sort of , um , taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanna query in relation to the words that are already in the file ,  Well , I guess , the two goals .  Um , one that Chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over , that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions ,  and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there .  ",
Bdb001.F,"so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what ,  um  I think we 're we 're we 're actually just  yeah ,  wrapping up ,  but ,  um  Yeah ,  sorry , it 's a uh short meeting ,  but , um  Well , I don't know .  Is there anything else ,  like  I mean that helps me a lot ,  but  So , I guess ,  yeah ,  if if you and Don can if you can show him the P - file stuff and see .  So this would be like for the F - zero  It 's like the history of ICSI .  Like  Yeah ?  And that isn't really , I guess , as important as the the main I don't know what you call it , the the main sort of word - level  Huh .  OK .  Well , that 's really useful .  I mean , this is exactly the kind of thing that I wanted to settle .  Um ,  so  Great .  Yeah .  I guess it 's also sort of a political deci  I mean , if if you feel like that 's a community that would be good to tie into anyway , then it 's sounds like it 's worth doing .  OK ,  great .  Cuz we actually can start  I mean , we can start with , um , I guess , this input from Dave 's ,  which you had printed out , the channelized input .  Cuz he has all of the channels ,  you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that .  So that would be i directly ,  um  Yeah .  And so then it would just be a matter of getting making sure to handle the annotations that are , you know , not at the word - level and , um , t to import the  Well , right now , I g Jane would would  Yeah .  Yeah ,  any kind of annotation that , like , isn't already there .  Uh , you know , anything you can envision .  Right .  Or the time .  I guess .  Mm - hmm .  Well , all the Switchboard in it .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  W - diff or diff .  Yeah .  You could definitely do that with the  But the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the utterances is the the speaker ons and offs .  So if you have a good ,  um  Yeah .  You just have to know wha what to tie it to .  And  Right , right .  But ,  d isn't that something where whoever if if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different ye um , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they  You know what I mean ?  Then Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help .  But the problem is exactly as Adam said , that you get , you know , y you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow ,  so  But they 've also  Exactly .  And so that 's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data , say that you know , that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that .  Uh , yeah , time is the  Time is passing !  Yeah .  He he 's a language modeling person , though .  But still they  Exactly .  Yeah .  Yeah .  You only know the boundaries of the  Right .  Right .  You can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that 's it .  And beyond that , all you know is is relative ordering  and sometimes even that is wrong .  So .  And then infer that their time - marks are somewhere in between .  Yeah , exactly .  Definitely .  Definitely .  Alright .  Well , I guess , w I I didn't want to keep people too long  and Adam wanted t people  I 'll read the digits .  If anyone else offers to , that 'd be great .  And  if not , I guess  Thanks thanks a lot .  It 's really helpful .  I mean , Adam and Don will sort of meet  and I think that 's great .  Very useful .  Go next .  ",,
Bmr001.A,"OK .  We 're somewhere in between .  OK , so we have some sheets for uh some standard doohickies to  OK , so this is February second , eh , two thousand ,  this is eh meeting number one with Adam and Dan and Morgan , about five o ' clock uh in the afternoon .  A range of microphones .  What 's this one here ?  This this one is has a couple of cheezy electrettes and  That 's connected too , or ?  That 's connected .  It 's got two to both channels .  Yeah .  OK .  OK .  This is  Mm - hmm .  Um , I have no idea which one I 'm I 'm on .  Oh one !  Oh , I 'm number one .  OK , which is a a l a lapel ,  in fact it 's sticking through my lapel .  I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody 's home movies .  Yeah , OK .  OK , what do we do with the stuff on top ?  But I  Do we say it after we  What are we why are we writing it down ?  Oh .  OK That 's good .  So I don't need to fill that out right now .  So maybe we should just say it .  So then we 're not spending the time writing it out .  So that we 're spending the time talking .  I 'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things .  Right ?  Oh .  Right .  OK , so this is Morgan .  I 'm going to read some numbers now .  That 's my group .  Yeah .  I don't know if I said mine was transcript zero ,  but it was .  Oh , good .  OK .  That 's a little bit .  So , so where are we in this ?  Let 's see , so we now we now have a few mikes that work .  How long did it take you to set this up ?  Are we gonna I mean , is it gonna be over there , or is it gonna be in there ?  So that 's what 's gonna happen .  Oh I mean , I don't know .  Did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had ?  Uh , how much are we talking about here ?  Yeah , I mean , you know , we we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without without worrying about it .  I mean , I think um I 'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that that uh stuff gets broken or or you know .  Yeah .  Yeah , and there 's also the minor matter , it 'd be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say "" yes , this is where we do such - and - such "" , and then be able to see uh , you know , some kind of I mean it 's less important than doing what we 're doing right now  but  So .  Well , we should be able to just go buy some preamps , I would think .  Yeah .  Are we ?  Well .  I guess I 'd sort of figured that that Jim would do that at some point .  Right ?  Yeah .  OK .  Well If it 's too noisy and if there 's something we can buy , again for , you know , moderate amount of price , even if it takes a couple boxes or something , maybe we should just do it .  And then and then later we can uh replace it with  Because there may be other considerations that will go into the design .  I mean , uh our getting some experience with this may help to determine some of things that are I don't know might change this design , So .  There was uh a statement made uh which I don't think is right , by the way , but there was a statement made at the uh DARPA Communicator meeting I was at recently that um microphone multiple microphones at a distance of less than three feet or something like that were totally useless ,  completely irrelevant .  Yeah .  for nois noise cancelling .  Um , my counter argument is is an uh uh um , a white rat .  uh , which has th it 's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well .  Um but Yeah .  Right .  But I think that if my point is I guess if you if you have a um a uh s a volume in between the two the two uh uh sensors and you do something cleverer , there clearly are ways to get more out of it .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh very strong statements as a matter of fact , like one shouldn't even question it  and this was one of them that was kind of funny .  Um but I I I what I take it to mean is doing doing the dumb thing uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it  but I think it will be interesting to do other things that aren't dumb .  So I I still think it 's potentially interesting to do that .  Although we we 'll have to be uh a aware of this if we 're writing proposals about it , wherever , that there may well be reviewers who will say , "" well everyone knows that you can't get anything out of it if it 's if it 's close "" .  Uh , that is an interesting point .  Yeah .  Certainly you can get some  Yeah .  Hopefully .  ",,
Bmr001.A,"Well , we 're getting some we we 're getting some right now .  Well someone someone might be interested in in it .  Maybe .  But on the other hand , suppose that uh , you 're the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a PDA to to a meeting  and and and therefore you bring it in ,  and you probably want it to be as near to people as possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table .  Well .  Yeah .  Well , I think we should .  I mean , I think at least with two .  Right ?  Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh  uh OK maybe you th you 're the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they 're a few inches apart ,  but what if you have two of these things ?  And you know we have this this idea of the handshake back and forth and say "" I 'm here , I 'm here ""  "" We 're now an array . ""  Yeah  So uh so where are we uh now ?  I mean so we 've just uh We 're doing this recording so we show we can we 're capable of doing recording  uh there 's I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have to have more if we had more people participating in the meeting we 'd wouldn't quite be ready for that .  Uh .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  So a little bit of futzing , there 's the issue about a cabinet , we might want to change some pre - amps .  So we can do some more recordings but there 's there 's a little little bit of ramp up on that over the next month , say .  Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today , that that um uh if you downsample it sounded like it came it sounded like it was something like a gig gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample  and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour , if you used all if you used all  no , if you used all the channels .  Something like that ?  I thought it was one gigabyte .  It couldn't be twelve .  How 'd you cut it ?  OK , so that 's so that 's two gigabytes .  And then  Right .  But that 's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels .  So you can  right , so you can  Oh , we 'll do the higher math later , maybe but it 's so it 's so maybe like a gig or two a an hour ,  um but um  OK , that is a bit more than I thought .  Yeah so this 'll take some thought cuz we have we um  If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow .  What would you do ?  I mean  So what would we do for training ?  So if we 're if we 're training distant mi we 'd just use one of them ?  OK .  Well , although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff .  Right .  But you don't want to be constantly take putting that on disk and off disk and on disk .  Yeah .  The thing is it 's really not very expensive right now .  So it 's more of an issue of of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and figuring out where it goes .  Well , we don't it doesn't need to be backed up .  Yeah .  I think the only one using it has been Javier ,  but at this point I think it 's he 's only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago ,  so if nobody else is doing feature calculation  Pardon ?  How much space is that using up ?  Do you have any idea ?  Yeah , couple hours !  Well , anyway for this this recording we 're fine  cuz we 're only we 're only  how many mikes are we recording right now ?  OK .  Yeah , well that we can do something about .  Yeah .  What 's it do ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , so I think initially we should take up more space until we 've analyzed this and get a better sense of it  because uh we don I mean we 're not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point  we 're talking about a half hour of of speech  and so uh we should look at this carefully  but  Yeah , I was interested when I saw the twenty - four on there .  Wow , I mean that 's probably eight bits of noise .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  It 's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine ,  right ?  Didn't we already get that ?  Cuz you you can't have uh component tolerances that are uh sixteen million one in sixteen million parts ,  so .  I 'm s  Oh !  Yeah .  Hmm .  But we can FTP stuff over ,  right ?  So it 's connected .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  Um .  One suggestion I have is that um I think this maybe we should just read some more you made more of these ,  right ?  I think we should read some more because because this is very f  we we need to to work the the the uh the talkers more  ",,
Bmr001.A,"because we 're not gonna have that many meetings  and this is a pretty tiny amount of data .  So maybe we should do another number list and  Yeah .  Well this is us .  We 'll have a fair amount of annoyance  yeah I think  uh .  So , can we do we do another set ?  Are we are we are we sort of  we talked out about what we 're  OK .  Right .  I think they would .  And also he 's he 's he 's got at least one woman .  And we 're we have a little problem of no women ,  Yeah , well , when L when Liz uh Shriberg starts coming , then there 's another woman although she  Yeah .  Ah , that 's right .  That was it .  So .  Yeah .  No , well , actually we could have Jane uh Jane 's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of  probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she would be interested enough and have her read  Yeah .  Yeah .  Um I think that one of the neat things about having this little pilot thing from today is we should try it a couple different ways ,  so we should try to do it internally ,  maybe ask ask Jane if we could get her to do it or or or have her supervise a linguistics student or somebody  and uh see how long it takes , and you know , multiply out the cost ,  and then send send the same thing out , or maybe split it in halves or something something like that to a to an outside service  and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is .  And then we can assess it .  No .  No .  Right .  This was this was the point of having near zero skew .  Right ?  So you just pick one , with the best sounding one , and give it to somebody and they transcribe it .  Right .  Yeah , you could do fancy things , but it seems like that 's enough .  Yeah But uh I don't know .  This meeting , so , say it 's maybe going to be a half hour or something ,  and and uh we 've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty times uh real time to do this kind of transcription  um so you know in in principle then it 'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this .  And uh we 'll see which one of those seems closest to right  and if they ramped up , if towards the end it was faster you know , get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever does it  and um then uh like I say , check it out with an external service and see if it 's faster , cheaper , better , worse , whatever .  Then we 'll go from there .  I don't know .  I do I don't know the answer to that .  I don't know .  Well , I mean there 's this Cyber Transcriber service ,  right ?  And at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them what is the output of the recognizer .  So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like .  If it 's you know , if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing ,  or do you point ,  or I don't know .  There 's supposed to be some out out out - of - work shepherders or something in Scotland but  Ah , the internet .  Yeah .  Inexpensive .  OK so we 're degenerating ,  right .  Are are are we done with uh MR business ,  or ?  I mean what what 's maybe we should what are our action items ?  So there 's there 's the continuing process of cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that .  There 's taking the results of this meeting and putting it in some kind of decent form ,  probably getting some kind of single channel merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple sound file of some sort to a transcriber to deal with it rather than this massive thing .  That 's a little bit of stuff to do .  Right ?  Yeah , although it it it it may be separating out these numbers from the rest .  Yeah .  And then  Yeah and uh  Right .  So , with this next  Sure .  OK .  How many more you got ?  Well , let 's do some more while we got them here .  Well , you know , it 's not , but  Yeah , there 's just two more .  uh  OK .  So .  OK .  OK .  I 'd say we 're done .  So , is it it 's going to disk ,  or is this  And how how much disk do we have ?  ",,
Bmr001.B,"OK , so we 're live .  Are we live or are we Memorex ?  Right . So .  Is that alright ?  OK .  Yep .  Yeah , both channels .  Although the gain is pretty low .  So for the um read numbers task , I have extracted these  OK .  Right and I 'm now talking on microphone number two ,  uh , the wireless microphone number two .  I 'm  Actually , i  Yes , it 'll be pretty horrible .  So , what I have on these forms here is for the read numbers read digits tasks and it 's extracted directly from Aurora  and uh  So what I was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading reading the numbers on the form .  Fill it out .  No , you don't need to .  So that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing .  W Why don't you want to fill it out right now ?  Just so that  OK .  And so you have to be sure to pause between each line , since we 're going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way .  So I definitely wasn't pausing enough between them .  That 'll be an issue .  Yep .  Mm - hmm !  Right and that that included a fair amount of fiddling around , since it 's it 's more or less the first time we 've tried to do it .  I mean , ev eventually we 'll want to like tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't aren't people aren't tripping over the wires and so on .  Right .  Do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that ?  Well , I I can help them get done um one question is budget .  Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that .  Well , I think our intention at this point is when we 're not using it to record a meeting we 'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on .  So .  Right .  Not have it  Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway .  Sure .  Because we we 're gonna have to put it in a PDA .  Right ?  If we have microphones in a PDA it 's gonna need bias and a pre - amp .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  You you mean for noise cancelling , or ?  Do they mean omnidirectional ,  is that their point ?  I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions .  But .  Oh , I see .  It 's Oh , OK , so they 're not talking about how far apart the mikes are , they 're talking about how far they are from the speaker .  Hmm .  Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it ?  Cuz that 's that 's one way we could sneak it in .  Well .  Oh , you mean for location ?  OK .  Depends on who 's working on it .  Yeah , right .  but someone has to write some software to to actually do it .  Someone might .  Oh that 's uh  I was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake PDA right in front of someone instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now .  on the thought that my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little PDA in front of us and so the acoustics uh you might want to try to match the acoustics .  No , and I don't need to meet with those people .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  That 's right .  Three ,  right ?  So I guess this a pretty dense group  but it it 's getting a lot higher .  Well , I 'm trying to be .  So .  Except I s got a PDA way before  Well I was doing hand I was doing wearable computers at Boeing , so I guess I sort of count .  But .  Mm - hmm .  Well . Five with wireless .  So we could have eight .  Nine .  Excuse me , nine .  Five with wireless and four without , and four with wired .  Um , we don't have headsets though .  Oh , OK so we just have to c wander around and collect them up .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , there 's one in my office .  So .  So , we 'll just have to see if that works .  Right and also I would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely .  So , um , you know , we 're gonna want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the how we 're gonna store it all .  It was more than that .  We said , four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else .  And then we cut in half , by  That 's forty minutes  So , six gigabytes .  Yeah .  I came out at the gig an hour , at one point .  That that 's one computation I did for sixteen channels , sixteen bit .  Is it two gig an hour ?  I 'm off by an order of magni  That 's alright .  ",,
Bmr001.B,"Order of two .  Factor of two .  How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space  cuz it I mean it 's a nine gig drive and there 's four gig on sc on scratch and there 's about three gig unused , it looked like , on the home directory .  I just don't know enough about LINUX .  How hard is it to repartition ?  It 's a pain .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  So I 've I 've already created a "" U U , doctor speech , data , MR "" directory , or had Jane do it and uh um but there 's not a lot of free space around .  So it it it has currently about four gig on the drive that I think she 's going to put it on um .  And so we need we definitely need to go buy uh you know forty gig fifty gig of drive drive space .  That 's true .  I hadn't even thought about that , although it 'd be kind of interesting .  Yeah , it 's pretty horrible .  Yeah so it might be four .  Right ?  But it wouldn't be sixteen .  But that 's a separate training .  No wait .  More disk is better .  Absolutely .  I mean my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk .  And just not bother .  And back up .  Right , then it doesn't need to be backed up .  Yeah , we were talking about that .  I 'm not sure if anyone 's still using it .  I 'll send mail to speech local .  I 'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone 's still using it .  So that would last us for a while .  Well , right now we don't have any choice .  It r still records all sixteen channels .  It 's just most of them are all zeroes .  So that that 's on our list too .  Yep .  It 's mostly a question of user interface .  How do we how do we specify which ones are on ?  Yeah , so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way  do we ?  So these large sections when you guys aren't talking  Run what on those ?  OK .  Yeah , so , P Z  Yeah .  Yeah , it 's something that that we definitely need to look at with this .  Maybe we shouldn't 've subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try .  Right .  Yeah , so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P Z Ms are better than the middle sixteen bits .  Regardless , yeah .  W I was just noticing on the on the there 's a view meter , software view meter and the PZM gain is real low .  So .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah , that 's right .  We 've got lots of bits of noise .  Right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here .  You know , I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output .  Oh , it 's just not working .  OK .  Yeah , that way we don't we can't listen to it on this machine .  Right .  And we 've looked at it so we know it 's working .  I mean , you can see the little squiggles , and it looks like speech so  You just can't listen .  Right .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well right I I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page .  It 's just a question of uh of how much uh annoyance I wanted to put uh people going to meetings through .  Mm - hmm .  Sure .  Us , to begin with .  I think that 's the intention .  Well , I think I think , um , certainly us , Meeting Recorder .  Um , us other groups .  It just depends on how many meetings we 're we 're having .  Um .  Jerry also said it would be he would be willing to have his group , some of the AI meetings do it as well .  And uh  Exactly exactly .  I think there are enough incidental meetings for us to to do this .  And if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough , um , then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well .  Which I 'm interested in .  I mean , that 's one of the things , the whole reason I want a PDA as opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meetings .  Right .  That 's right .  That 's why I put ten on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty .  Right .  Well , I I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times , just for the novelty .  Oh , that 's a good point !  Boy , that 's abs I had never I hadn't even thought about that .  Oh , man !  Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I mean it 's a different style .  But I think that 's alright .  Um , we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones  Um , I had another question briefly about transcription .  So are we going get an external service or are we gonna do it ?  I mean who 's gonna generate the transcripts ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  ",,
Bmr001.B,"Yeah , the the problem of course is that it 's you know , in in this meeting it 's three four five six seven eight , it 's nine transcripts , potentially .  Oh , you 're right , yeah , yeah , yeah .  Right .  So the only thing we 'll have to be careful with is that they 're  well , what are they listening to ?  They 're going to have to make speaker assignments ,  and wh and which recording are they gonna listen to ?  Oh , that would be interesting .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yet .  So that I mean , that 's one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is gonna be another chunk of work .  Um .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field and we do an initial recognition pass , is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript , if the near field mike does a reasonably good job ?  I bet it isn't , unless it 's really close to right .  Right .  Some errors , yeah .  Not in Scotland .  Not in Scotland .  They they sheep they s they they speak cheap English ,  right ?  Sure .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  And then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition would be interesting to do .  That 's what I mean .  Yeah just doing a digits on it uh , connected digits .  You wanna read ?  Oh I on I did ten but I can I have a script to generate them automatically .  OK .  That 's why ,  yep .  Go ahead .  OK , go ahead and read it and then fill it out .  OK .  ",,
Bmr001.C,"OK , so that 's  Wait .  You 're going to sit there ?  Yeah , OK ,  maybe I 'll put this thing here then .  Yeah .  Yeah , that 's that 's the dummy dummy PDA .  Yeah , it is .  Oh , hang on .  Yeah , it is at the moment .  Yep .  Hang on , let 's let 's OK let 's just let 's just name the microphones .  So I 'm speaking on the ear mounted uh wired headset thing .  OK .  Yeah .  You 're on one .  Absolutely .  Yes .  OK so this is this is the PZM nearest the eh eh the machine room end of the table .  Then there 's  I know , but yeah .  It 's number three , it says , but we 'll be able to figure it out .  This is at the middle of the table  This further down the table .  And this this one is right at the end of the table ,  OK ?  And then we 've got the uh  This is the left side of the dummy PDA and this would be the right side .  Very exciting .  No .  Just write it down .  OK .  Well , how about you give me one of those  and we can fill it out  and Morgan can read  and then we can do it like that .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  This is these are things we will find out .  OK .  Can I have something to write on the back of ?  Thanks .  Oh !  It didn't doesn't take Well , I mean as you see we haven't really set it up that well , but it doesn't it doesn't take long to set up .  I mean , We just came up here one night after recording so it took like twenty minutes something like that .  I mean it 's  Yeah , I mean the equipment  Right .  The equip Me and Adam went through it yesterday , just looked at everything .  But it 's all kind of here and set up , so it 's just a question of turning it all on .  And , um running the program .  Right .  Um , it 's it 's gonna b it 's for reasons because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there .  There 's more equipment in there .  But there 's the idea is that there are these microphones on the table ,  there are some cables coming down sort of under a nice mat ,  and then that 's they a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there .  And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors , so that so that it 's not open to fiddling .  That 's  We need to do that .  It 's on a list of things to do .  I keep on hoping that they 're gonna get done but they don't .  I  Yeah !  Yeah .  Um . I don't know .  A cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollars , two hundred dollars something like that .  I mean .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But , well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean there 's one big issue with the equipment still , which is um ultimately we 're gonna well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets ,  but there 's this amplification problem .  I built this thing , it 's that 's it 's very noisy .  We 're actually recording I 'm I 'm going through it at the moment , but it 's so noisy that I am not using for this .  it 's it 's designed to be used for the for the desktop meeting as well .  But I 'm using running that through my uh damp machine as a pre - amp as an alternative .  Yeah .  It 's just it eh  You see how clumsy this is  right ?  I have to use these batteries to bias them .  And I 'm only get two channels and there 're a bunch of There are like three connectors in the circuit .  The thing is , like , it 's it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one in one swoop .  So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one .  um And I 'm still not sure .  I mean , I think I probably know how to fix this .  I can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but it 's kind of a buy .  Well , we could just  Yeah .  Well n  Yeah .  Jim is busy at the moment .  That 's the problem .  I was kind of hoping that Jim was going to build this box .  But um but he hasn't had time .  Well , I think I think he is quite interested in doing it .  But .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh !  Oh .  OK .  This happened .  I think uh , I mean , uh my guess is that means it 's just that if it 's if it 's near field , the mathematics of beam beam steering is different .  If the f if the wavefronts are not approximately planar then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work .  I guess .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Right , right , right .  I mean the um The the weird thing is that actually delay in some beam - forming is not is not the clever thing to do .  ",,
Bmr001.C,"The the the underwater guys do this stuff which is different .  And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible .  Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get separation , you sort of you want them very close .  And And the math is too difficult for me to understand but it 's but it 's there .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well we could I mean .  By the time We 'll have we 'll have data so we can actually you know , demonstrate that .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  But I mean .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep , yep .  For those those we can make several several more of these and then we can have actual recording with you know three P D  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right , right .  Yeah .  And that that seems very uh easy to believe scenario , I mean , given the number of palm pilots we 've got on the table right now , so .  Yeah .  Yeah , but But that it 's  We 're not , even , you know It 's we 're just It 's not like we We we may be technical , but we 're not particularly PDA people .  So it 's That 's just how it is .  Well , I know .  Well , that 's true .  I mean .  OK .  Right .  Well we 've got we 've got Right now we could have two more people on wireless ,  with a trip to Leo 's Audio we could get a third extra person on wireless ,  and uh right now we could have three more three more people wearing mikes like this , and that would just work .  I mean I 'm not sure how how good the quality is on this mike but I think it 's going to be OK .  So we could actually have eight people with with headset mikes with , I mean , basically no extra effort .  Yeah .  Nine .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  We have the um the ones we 've been using , the ones we got for the PC .  Yeah , yeah .  I think we have three of those .  So , and the h  Right , right .  They don't all work , but the nice ones , the um Plan - Plantronic ones work .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Per channel , or ?  We figured out that it was t twelve gig twelve gigabytes an hour ?  For for all the channels ?  Was that with or without the  Cuz no , we 've only no , I mean we 've only got four gigabytes and that  Yeah .  Right .  And then we then we cut it in half .  But By s saving sixteen bits on instead of thirty instead of thirty - two .  Well no I mean it 's uh four gigabytes for forty minutes .  Forty - eight kilohertz , yeah .  So we can actually triple that .  So , hang on  so that would OK  Well I think it 's I think it 's two gig an hour .  Cuz like , we don't Maybe we don't We don't need to save all channels ,  right ?  So , on average . We could we don't we we wouldn't use all the channels , necessarily .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I 'm sure .  Yeah .  It 's a pain .  I mean , you know , because cuz we 've got data on "" user "" ,  right ?  And then we 'd have to back it all up and copy it back on again .  Yeah .  Hmm .  No .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  We don't need all we don't necessarily need it all on - line .  I mean it will be different subsets .  So you won't you won't , you know , do all sixteen channels in a single  Yeah .  You typically train I mean you 'd have fi you 'd have fifty hours  we 'd only use one of the PZM channels ,  something like this ,  and so that would you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels at once .  But it 's kind of painful for because basically , if we put them on C Ds then each CD will have all the channels for one recording ,  and then when you want to build the P - files , you just want to get one of those files off each of the sessions  and  Yeah .  Well , maybe two of them , but I mean we wouldn't use we 'd only use the distant mikes ,  right ?  Yeah .  Right if if we if we burn it all on CD - ROM , then , um ,  in fact , we could you know we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that .  Somebody used it recently .  Yeah .  It 's uh twenty C Ds ,  so that 's twelve gigabytes .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Probably , we could we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win .  I think that 's a good  Shorten .  Tony Robinson 's uh lossless compression thing .  Um , it it does AR modeling  and so it looks at a section , it runs an AR model to sort of r w to whiten it and then quantizes the residual with a nice with the three bits it can get away with .  Something like that .  ",,
Bmr001.C,"So I think it On on each block it 'll it 'll compress you know if there 's load on in any range it 'll use ratio bits .  I think it does that .  Yeah , well .  Well , it 's OK ,  it 's only the first try .  I what I 'm thinking is um obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four , so we can just have different gain things that we use you know per channel .  Yeah .  I think probably the bottom four bits are not any good ,  Right ?  Although you know it claims they are .  But probably the  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah !  Oh yeah !  These theories things are pretty amazing .  And And there 's help help they seem they seem good though they seem to be  Oh , God knows .  Yeah , yeah .  Right .  Right .  That that card that machine 's got sound They 've got a sound blaster built into it .  I just I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out how well the sound infrastructure would deal with both at once  but I think yeah , that 's , uh probably it will be fine .  There 's no ,  For a couple of reasons .  Well , but the @ @ There are two ways we could listen to it .  There 's a sound there 's actually sound output built into this thing .  But the driver I haven't the driver may not support it yet .  And then there 's also the sound or the sound card built in .  But I don't know how to I don't know how the operating system would like having two sound cards .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Sure .  Well no , OK , the question I still have about what we 're going to do is what is what eh OK , so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we 're in a situation where we can with , you know , ten minutes of preparation , we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording .  Um .  What are wh When are we Are we going to do that ?  Who are they going to be ?  What meetings are we going to record ?  So which which meetings What meetings do we have ?  I mean like "" us "" being the Meeting Recorder people or "" us "" being anything that speech local does .  Yeah .  And we should have like we should have Decoder meetings and stuff .  Yeah , I mean that 's the thing .  It 's OK to g  Right .  Yeah .  Right .  Well , we 've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case .  Cuz that that 's the real goal .  Right .  But I mean if we if we want Jerry 's group to use it then we probably @ @ won't ask them to read any numbers ,  right ?  Cuz .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's great .  I know .  I know , it 's a disaster .  It 's alright  she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her ,  right ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  We could we could have the reading group in here .  Yeah .  I mean .  Yeah , it 's great .  OK .  Mm - hmm  Mm - hmm .  Well , Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually ,  right ?  You would send I mean , uh a transcriber is used I mean , I don't know , assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting ,  right ?  And so they they just have to indicate that the speaker changes .  Right ?  Yeah .  So so they they 're gonna they 're gonna have to make speaker assignments or something like this .  For one of one of @ @ .  Or we could mix we could mix the the headset mikes , you know , just to make a single high q high quality  and we could do and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that you only , you know you only you cut it out when there 's no energy .  So you don't @ @ noise .  Yeah .  I mean there 's it 's If we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this , probably .  Yeah .  And Yeah .  As much work as you want .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Wow .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah .  I have just because it 's such an un  The transcribing is sort of something I can imagine doing , whereas having this distraction of having sort of something that looks like it might be right but has got some very wrong bits in is sort of a less less easy thing to do .  I 'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for  Yeah Yeah , that 's true ,  that 's true .  Yeah , by fixing up transcripts .  Yeah , but Yeah .  Yeah .  They should all be in India right now .  That 's where the good , but the cheap English speakers are .  I 'm sorry , yeah .  Well they don't speak such clear English  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Wow .  What fun it is .  It 's interesting that um it m it 's not clear whether it 's better to have them written as as words or or figures .  ",,
Bmr001.C,"But , of course , to get zero and "" O ""s distinguished we you have to do it .  But it 's kind of weird to read .  Thanks .  OK .  Oh , I wonder I wonder if we ran out of disk space yet .  ",,
Bmr002.A,"Channel one .  off by one .  Right .  So go ahead .  Can So we can do them again ?  Yeah .  I 'm on channel one  Mike one ,  channel zero , probably .  Channel zero .

Yeah .  Well , one th  The other thing is is that we might be  Oh .  Well , that 's what I was gonna say , is that Adam has foot pedals that we could probably try and rig something up to  Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow and change it w  Does it lose the memory once you 've unpowered it ?  Right .  Right , this is the pilot data .  Hmm .  Awesome .  Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard was at least , I mean , the output was that they had speaker turns  and they um analyzed it in terms of , you know , "" this is where this speaker change came in ""  and of course that gets really difficult when you 're talking about  I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were talking about in uh your lunch talk ,  is that is that you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that that , you know , disrupt the um the segment you know the segmentation .  Right .  Right .  So . So  So we maybe we should look at the um the tools that Mississippi State has .  Because , I d I I know that they published um i annotation tools ,  you know , for their ins  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Sure .  We can hear all your conversations along the way .  Right , but we can do automated alignment .  That 's not a problem  I think  I th  Well , to get to get the r to get the actual transcript , I think we 'll do OK  because of because of the separate channels .  Right .  Right .  Right .  Well I know that I know that um the Mississippi State tools , at least th what the produce does not come out in STM format .  They they basically give  um They subdivide into WAVE files  and then they give for each , they give a one oh , you know , a WAVE file that g indicates where the start and stop times are ,  and then um and then give the uh whatever the sentence information .  But I mean Ni - i i i it as you said , it was easy to convert back and forth between um that file and STM format ,  in fact what I did is I took the Mississippi State data , and just made STM files out of it .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , looks like Looks like uh work packages .  Must be a European project .  Oh , so they 're using the Alembic Workbench , from Mitre .  I guess .  I don't know .  Oh ,  this is ,  I see .  They 're reviewing , and  I see .  Mitre ,  But that kind of thing I think we would probably want to extract automatically .  I mean , e this is , the this is a conversation that we should have with Liz .  Right ,  I think ,  because she 's going to be She 's going to be the one who 's the most concerned about this kind of thing .  And so she may have some ideas . on on that particular issue .  Yeah .  Can I see that ?  Right .  Oh , so this 'd this w is probably what the L D C uses .  I mean they do a lot of transcription at the L D  I could ask my contacts at the LDC what what it is they actually use .  I mean , I know , I mean I 've got I 've got contacts up there ,  so .  So .  Yeah .  No .  Right .  We 're very good at time alignments .  Right .  OK .  Uses what ?  So it 's very interest I mean , it 's interesting that one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman from the LDC  Which means that I don't know what "" coordinator "" means in in terms of that .  I mean  What what is what is what is this web page from ?  Sure .  I see .  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  Right .  Actually what I would have come up with was w w "" What was the web address of that thing "" ,  which we didn't  we didn't record that .  Right .  slash slash capital CTA slash , l  Yeah .  Yeah .

OK , now , that means if I 'm going to be standing in there looking , then someone else has to write them down .  because I won  OK .  Fine .  Let 's not try to do anything too easy .  Testing .  Yep .  They 're in the folder right there .  You may .  So , Jane , can you talk into your mike ?  You said it 's mike four ?  Well , hmm , I 'm glad you like it .  Uh Eric , what mike are you ?  Mike one  Looks like it . S  talk again ?  Thank you .  OK .  Um , can you do taps on the P D  and the P Z  And you have to actually check what the nu  The - Start with P Z  Thank you .  I can't tell .  Yep .  Thanks .  F Thank you .  OK .  And PDA ,  left , right ?  I don't see anything .  Ah .  Yep .  All OK .  Thank you .  Did we just record all that ?  Should we start it over ?  OK .  The ones that aren't filled out are the ones you want to hand out .  I threw the ones out , that we already recorded  but we didn't record .  Right . So the first task is to read some digits .  So I 'll go ahead and start .  And This is Adam on mike number two ,  So . If you could just fill out the form ,  and then later on we 'll read it , with pauses between .  And we 're session two .  Let her fill it out and go ahead and read .  So you wanna pause briefly between each one  so that the person transcribing can tell where one ends and one begins .  So , a short sentence between each line .  Well , you can intone it however you want .  Imagine that you 're reading a number phone number to someone .  Yep .  OK . Good .  Thanks .  So we 'll probably do another one at the end of the meeting .  just to get some more digits .  And , uh  Thank you .  What - what 's your mike number , Jane ?  Dan doesn't remember what sex he is .  That 's true , it 's it 's really difficult .  Well , don't you  I I wrote a scanner program that scans these forms in .  Anyway . So , why did I call you all here ?  Um , what I 'd like to talk about is , um the transcription .  So , as part of this um project , we need to transcribe these meetings .  um , to do training and test and so on .  and , uh , so we need word transcripts and , uh , speaker change identification .  So , speaker ID .  And , uh so I 'd sort of like to know who 's going to do that ,  hi Jane ,  and uh what tools to use ,  what other resources you might need ,  and also what we  things like just the data format and how we 're going to do it .  Oh really ?  Cuz Morgan said he asked you .  Mm - hmm .  And so , one of the first questions is , "" do you need help ? ""  That 's not the first question .  Ah right .  Uh , that 's  I I was saying before we don't really have to worry about people being surprised by it .  Play .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , I actually have some foot pedals for the P C .  Uh , keyboard .  and they generate keystrokes .  Um There 's a little program that downloads into it .  Um .  But the program probably only runs in Windows ,  although I bet we could program it once  And and then put it on another machine and it would work .  I haven't used them .  I don't know .  I don't think it does .  I 'm not using them anymore .  I used to use them .  So they 're currently set up for Shift , Control , and Alt .  But I r I don't use them .  They 're not even plugged in .  And so tha uh if that would help , uh I 'm certainly willing to donate them .  And it it is a PC connection ,  so it would have to go on a P C somewhere .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , yeah , you are generating it .  Well , that that was part of the question ,  is that if , for if we 're doing this regularly  Imagine we 're doing a couple of hours a week of transcripts  um , of recording ,  uh , I wouldn't expect you to do it all .  So the question is do you know of resources that we could use .  So are there grad students or undergrads or just commercial services ?  Oh , really ?  So we only have to give them credits ,  We don't have to give them money ?  Oh , you do have to pay them .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  ",,
Bmr002.B,"Well , we we need to We need to find out how much that will cost , so I can pass that on to Morgan ,  cuz right now we have almost no money .  So so the cheaper we can do it , the better .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , if in terms of transcripts , sure ,  but in terms of speaker change it might be nice to get the actual time .  Right .  Oh , in terms of data format , what are we going to do about that ?  I mean , you have the S T M format , where you have you know , every phrase , every utterance is is a single speaker .  I mean , is that the right way to do it ?  Or  Is that the right way to do it ?  OK .  OK . So that means that for each utterance , we 'll need the time marks ,  the start and end of each utterance .  Mm - hmm .  Well , X Waves have some as well ,  but they 're pretty low level .  They 're designed for um for phoneme - level  Although , they actually have a nice tool for that could be used for speaker change marking .  OK .  Ha - Have you looked at it already ?  Mm - hmm .  a a is this  Oh . So , these are p particularly for time alignment ?  Right . are they just for time alignment or are they for transcription as well ?  Th - i It 's wireless .  I mean it won't  Sure .  Yeah , don't talk to yourself too much .  So , For the digits For the d  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I 'm not sure if we can do automated alignment or not .  I mean , e especially in e with speaker change in a meeting like this , where we 're overlapping so much ,  I don't think we 're gonna have a a prayer .  Oh , that 's true .  Right .  We could just do it through these .  I hadn't even thought about that .  Sure .  Um . In terms of data formats , uh what I did for the Digits stuff was just to hand - rolled my own . That looks like this form .  You know , it 's just uh something that 's easy to parse in Perl .  Um . Probably for the full one , we 'll want to do something like S T  I mean , some format that our tools already work with .  Yeah , presumably .  Yeah , I guess that 's true .  Yeah .  OK . "" MATE Mark - up Framework "" .  OK ?  Oh , no !  It has the word "" X M L "" in it !  Is that free ?  But it doesn't have enough pictures .  So , I think it will require too much reading to understand whether this is anything that we can easily use .  "" TEI "" is ?  Oh .  Well , I guess XML makes some amount of sense .  I 'm not actually familiar with it  but it seems to be the sort of thing that this would be good for .  But  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right , but it 's I think for the initial task , just getting the word transcripts and speaker change is highest on my list .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Well I think that uh  It sounds like you 're at least a little familiar with these tools , Jane ,  so Are y Do you feel comfortable just picking one ?  Um , because  OK .  Signed language is interesting .  Well , so , how should we proceed on picking a tool ?  Jane , do you want to pick a few  and we 'll download them and try them out ?  Is that the right thing to do ?  No , we 're not going to do time alignment .  Right , and so but , in terms of what the transcriber needs to do , they 're not going to have to do time alignment .  Except maybe for word speaker change ,  but  OK , then we 'll have to use it .  No no question .  Boy , the recognition on what you just mumbled is going to be really horrible .  Yeah .  OK , So , so , it 's called "" Transcriber "" you said ?  gacks  Mm - hmm .  Well , I think  Well , I just wrote down the French site  and I will check it and try to download it  And uh see what it looks like .  Yeah , they have a  I vaguely recall that they have a pages uh tools page somewhere ,  with like lists and lists and lists of uh various and assorted tools .  Mm - hmm .  So , Um , we 'll start with "" Transcriber ""  and if it looks like that 's not gonna do what we need , we 'll move on to the Mississippi State  and if it doesn't look like that 's going to work , we 'll look at something else .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Also , I wanted to mention just in passing that uh another thing that we 're going to want to start collecting is queries for the meetings .  So if over the next couple of days you find yourself wondering what we talked about in the meeting , write down the sort of query you 'd like to make .  Do you understand what I mean ?  So , imagine that we had Meeting Recorder all done , and you had one ,  what might you do with it ?  So ,  if they occur to you .  Right .  ",,
Bmr002.B,"That 's a good one .  Send m So , if you could just email me them .  Yeah , except we didn't record .  So .  It 's WWW dot ETCA dot FR .  s l slash lots of other stuff , yeah .  So , when is she showing up ?  April .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Right , since we have almost none right now , let 's  We need to move forward from there .  But uh , yeah , I guess it 's O K .  And then , uh there 's also just the general question of will it handle multiple channels or should we just  Dan and I spoke about this briefly ,  do we want to try to combine channels somehow to make the transcriber 's job easier ?  I was listening to some of it  and uh  like , if you just listen to the far P Z M the person sitting at this end of the table you can hardly hear at all .  on on the transcript ,  so there may be  it may be worthwhile to at least try a little bit to combine the channels .  Huh .  Neat !  Oh , so , that would be interesting as well to do that .  Well , I bet if you used this one the two s most separated P Z  Well , maybe , maybe not .  Big ears .  Right .  OK ,  do we have anything else to talk about with transcribes ?  And we 'll run a train a neural net  and create a recognizer  and do information retrieval  and  Well , that 's my interest .  I mean , other people have different interests ,  so .  That 's what I want .  Right .  Right .  Well , what the so , the reason we 're doing near field as well is if that doesn't work we wanna back we want some something that will work .  Right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Why ?  Y  The question is , "" is it will it work well enough to do information retrieval ? ""  So , w will the application the Meeting Recorder application , work ?  So , Is Part of the research is um "" is fifty percent accuracy enough to do an useful information retrieval ? ""  It might be .  That 's right ,  Well , but you know we have to try .  We we we could simply not do the project .  But I think that 's a bad solution .  Oh , I didn't know that .  Yep .  He has he has the open piece of paper .  So , open notebook .  I have one  but I 've carefully covered it so that it doesn't  Well , I think to some extent with things like the stress and the other prosodic things  an and tighter time alignments that we can do  I think we should probably do those  but only once we have a consumer of that data  ' You know , so right now we have a consumer of the word transcripts and the speaker change .  Me .  I want those things to work .  And so I would like to get that done as quickly as possible .  And so , if if Liz or someone else wants to do some work on uh prosody and on stress and so on then we can go back to the data and generate the uh the transcripts that we need .  Even for an undergrad ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Accuracy ?  Certainty ,  islands of certainty .  Yeah .  No .  Mm - hmm .  Sure .  All caps .  Anything else ?  I 'm gonna go download "" Transcriber ""  and Jane and I will look at it  Oh  Well I think the answer is we need to record as many as we can .  Right ? I don't see any reason not to try to record a meeting or two a week .  Um .  I mean , more if we can .  And uh so I wanna um I wanna start by in the next couple weeks just doing the Speech group  until we get to the point where we 're fairly comfortable with the hardware and the software and everything works .  and then I think I 'll  also uh a Jerry volunteered to have his group do a few .  So , I 'll uh try to get those as well .  We have five of the wireless .  And then we were going to be getting a bunch of wired ones as well .  I mean notice that n  your you you stood up and walked around .  None of the rest of us have .  And so we could have wired mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal .  for bigger meetings .  So .  It really makes you feel like you 're doing real work  when you get all this hardware .  Yep .  Why ?  I had noticed that you were talking quietly ,  and I was actually going to ask you .  I was going to ask you to speak up .  But I didn't want you to feel self - conscious .  Oh .  I 've been trying to rotate it through .  So , Dan will get it next time .  Do you feel like a television star ?  That that makes sense ,  right ?  Cuz he 's not heavily encumbered with this  N You should have run it under your sweater , though .  I think we 're there .  uh  He he he changed the downsampling .  OK , so this is Adam , on uh  mike number two , wireless headset  OK ?  Thanks very much .  Just control - C , Dan ?  ",,
Bmr002.C,"I think that 's recording now .  Um , do it again .  That 's uh That 's in channel one .  Channel one .  Let me make sure .  There are no There 's only one connection element .  It 's zero - based .  Unfortunately the mikes are you know  This this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes .  Consistently not equal to the numbers numbers on the channels .  Well , you can write it down .  I mean Write down whatever you like .  I don't know .  You can do whatever any way you like .  The weird thing is that um it means that it varies when you move your head around  but I think it 's probably the better solution .  OK ?  Do we have the numbers ? the the sheets , that we did from last time ?  so we can do them again ?  Great .  I 'm on uh mike three .  This is mike three ,  coming in here .  It 's moving around as I move my head backwards and forwards .  So that 's just the way it goes .  That 's life .  That 's just what it does .  That 's right .  OK .  P Z Ms ? or or not P Z  Because this is PZM number three .  Let 's list them in order .  PZM number three was the furthest away .  This is the next one in , which is PZM number four , apparently .  PZ  What - Can you can you see other stuff happening ?  This is PZM number four .  which is closest to the machine room .  I mean I don't know .  It 's all hopeless .  This is uh one side of PDA , I guess .  We could actually give these sides names ,  right ?  This would be left ,  wouldn't it .  I know ,  but I 'm just asking .  I wasn't asking you .  This is this is PDA left .  You getting something there ?  And this is PDA right .  They will vary in future .  Because it depends which one of these shows more consistency then .  No .  Well , we 're w we 're so ahead of the game now ,  cuz we 've got built - in downsampling now .  We 've got built - in downsampling .  And so it 's only recording sixteen kilohertz data ,  and we 've got  We 're not select We 're not recording the empty channels .  What about the ones that we didn't record ?  OK ?  Fine .  Then it doesn't matter ,  does it .  Before that .  OK .  So , this is Dan on mike three ,  wireless headset ,  I 'm wearing it around my neck .  which may be different than wearing it on the head .  And  Great .  It 's kind of weird .  That was great , what you did .  Um  Yeah , cuz I figure no one 's going to be able to figure it out  from the from my name .  So ,  Yeah .  Oh , right , right , right .  Well , hang on .  Well , Well , I guess .  Do you So , do you  What are what are we talking about ?  That you 're gonna you 're gonna do transcriptions ?  You 're going to listen to these things and  OK .  D I And do you have a clear I mean , is that  Do you sort of  Are you going to have to make up what you do  or do you have a very clear idea of what you 're going to do ?  So I mean , is it is it Is this l Is it like something you 've done before ?  or  Yeah .  And ,  Yeah .  Yeah ,  because as people are going to be listening to it afterwards  and saying "" Oh listen to her .  She couldn't even speak true English sentences ! ""  Oh , you 're meant You 're meant to speak naturally .  You 're meant to say "" Oh , I didn't realize we were being recorded ! ""  It 's just It 's just jewelry .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  The problem is The nice thing about transcribers is they have foot pedals ,  Oh .  I see .  I I I actually have one .  Well , Sarah has one  because she does a lot of transcribing of interviews .  But The crazy thing is we 'd have to convert the s we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette . to use it .  I mean , given that we 've already got them digitally it would be  you know , it 's quite tempting to use some kind of uh software thing .  But but then there 's the question of the ergonomic interface , that  OK .  What do they connect to ?  Oh , that 's totally cool .  now how how do you how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ?  Hmm .  And this is Windows ?  Uh - huh .  So hang on .  You have You have these foot pedals but you d you 're not using them .  Yeah .  Wow .  That 's so cool .  OK .  Well ,  the d the well , the uh The part that 's not wonderful is someone has to write the software .  Yeah .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well ,  Yeah , absolutely .  Yeah .  What 's her name ?  OK .  Uh - huh .  So  Oh , OK .  So , the p I mean , what I 'm hearing is that the problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts is kind of I mean , it 's not a it 's not an unfamiliar problem .  ",,
Bmr002.C,"So that  So that I mean that basically , there are standard solutions and we should just adopt adopt them  and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost ,  I mean there 's We 're we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost  cuz probably the low cost solution 's already been established .  And so that 's just whatever it is .  That 's how we 'll do it .  See what I mean ?  Mm - hmm .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Well , whatever they people who have had to do this  I mean the only thing is I wonder if our requirements are different from um I mean there 's than than what 's been done in the past  than discourse analyzers  because maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align you know , how much time aligned detail we need and uh how much detail in terms of people .  I don I don't know how much ti I don't think we do need any time aligned detail .  I think we just have basically one text file which runs from beginning to end .  But .  Sure .  But not if it costs more .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  Right , I mean , the it 's sort of it 's a little In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it with Switchboard  because the telephone is so actually people are less flexible in what they do .  In this kind of situation where we 've got nonverbal channels then there 's a lot of overlap  and there 's just that it 's not a very good model .  Well , every utterance is a single speaker ,  right ?  It 's just that utterances can overlap .  I mean ,  I think so .  I think I think I mean , I think when I 'm when  Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence , and that should be like one utterance  and then I had a couple of backchannels in there  and they should be just overlapping things that  I don't think that we should break Eric 's sentences for those . I think  Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere  but we can't necessarily I mean , we we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us if we give them software  but we may not  in which case we 'll have to get them some other way ,  like with forced alignment later ,  I mean you know all this can be done .  Yeah .  Phoneme phoneme phoneme transcriptions .  Yeah .  There 's a there are there 's a whole bunch of tools .  There 's a some web page , where they have a list of like ten of them or something .  No , no , no . There 's some I mean , I just there are there are a lot of a lot of @ @ these things .  Oh , EAGLES .  Yeah , that 's the European one .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  You don't  Just take the thing with you .  Well , I don't know what will happen ,  but you may as well .  Sure . Sure . Sure .  My uh My s  Yeah , so be just  Yeah .  Yeah ,  that 's true .  You can leave it behind as well if you want .  I I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing ,  right ?  So they probably will have tools to address the actual the the the transcriber support  and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you ,  which is , you know , exactly the problem we have .  Right .  Right .  But then again we don't have to do it .  and  Oh sure , we are .  We 've got individual microphones .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well ,  Yes ,  although that might @ @ presumably we 'll have one we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between .  When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM ,  but if we 're rather than rather than designing our own format , we 'll just take whatever comes out of the tools that we can find to use , I think .  I I I 've got no idea what that 'll look like .  but  on our speaker phones .  Right .  Mmm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Good .  Right .  Oh , good .  It must be It must be fundable then .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  Alembic ?  No .  Mm - hmm .  I don't think so .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Because the transcriber 's put in intonational tags ?  Or maybe not .  Well .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Who 's it from ?  Right .  Is it the French one ?  U Penn .  I think that I 've heard of this one .  It was the one that Steve Renals mentioned .  Sure .  Can I see ?  Well Well , We are going to do time alignment .  but we 'll probably do it ourselves ,  right ?  So we 're not we 're not concerned about getting getting about buying and or bringing in tools .  We 're not very good  but we 're proud of ourselves .  We 're very proud of our time alignment .  Right .  I mean , it 's not a bad  Oh look !  It uses Snack !  Um .  It uses Snack .  That 's a TCL audio thing that I had some involvement with .  Yeah .  If I have to use it  ",,
Bmr002.C,"I 'm sure I 'm sure It 's a TCL - based thing .  I 'm sure it 's just wonderful .  Yes , T "" Transcriber was developed with the scripting language TCL TK and C extensions .  It relies on the Snack sound extension , which allows support for most common audio formats . ""  Yeah .  It 's the French one .  I mean , no , I I  But I 've never downloaded it .  Someone mentioned it to me .  And that 's probably why they mentioned it to me ,  because they thought I would be excited because it 's TCL - based .  Oh "" Deliverable D - three point one "" ,  Oh yeah .  Transcriber  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  That 's a fine question .  Wow .  So this thing , this uh deliverable D - three point one of the MATE project is a review of a lot of different tools .  They 're actually , they seem to be more  the tool the main focus of the tools is you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns transi transcriptions with uh discourse roles  and things like that .  But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well .  And I could be wrong .  Right .  I Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs ,  listened to them in stereo .  And I was very impressed by how well you could hear separate speakers ,  but I haven't I haven't done very extensive tests .  you get a certain amount of spatial information .  It 's not It 's not consistent  but it 's Gives you some noise  Yeah , yeah ,  you 'd get get wide coverage .  Right .  Right .  But I mean But you would you would You know , you 'd get good You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table .  So .  Well , what is what is the goal ?  again ?  We 're going to end up with some I mean , ultimately , we 're going to end up with transcriptions of these meetings .  What ,  and then Then Then we 'll be done ,  huh ?  Um .  Of course , there are different kinds of recos  so we 're going to actually train a recognizer based on these uh , far - field mikes  cuz what we that 's the problem we 're trying to solve .  OK .  We need a lot of I mean  Well and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately .  Um .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Close mikes .  I mean I  yeah , I feel like that What we 're actually going to do with these data is very unclear to me  Well , because I don't think that 's a That 's not going to work .  Right ?  OK . We 're going to get horrible performance on that .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Well , we know the answer to that , but unfortunately , will we get fifty percent p accuracy ?  Yeah .  And are they specifically far field mikes ?  OK .  Yeah .  Well , I mean , that would be tremendously useful information  assuming that we actually pursue it ,  but um we 've got a huge problem ,  because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data .  And um it 's just eh it 's very frightening .  uh - uh  Who , Eric ?  Outrageous !  Laying out his folders .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Lea ?  I see .  Yeah .  OK . If you think it won't slow you down at all .  Yeah .  Yeah , that 's great .  No , well , presumably there 's a an annotation standard for prefix characters or something like that .  That 's what they 're using here .  OK .  Yeah , exactly .  Exactly .  Exactly .  Well , so , um  What is the plan ?  We 're gonna  I mean , How many How many How many meetings ?  What about r our recording schedule ?  How many meetings are we going to record ?  Um .  Which ones are we going to transcribe ?  Um .  Do we  OK .  Absolutely .  Yeah .  OK .  Five .  Well .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  If we can do anything with it , yeah .  I don't feel like you 're speaking unnaturally quietly .  I mean I feel like it 's all quite normal .  Yeah .  Eric 's really got it easy cuz he 's got the lapel mike , which is so unobtrusive .  They 're much more expensive .  I I Which I don't understand  but there it is .  Right , it 's because they make people feel like television stars .  So you can charge more for it .  Yeah , that 's it .  That must be it .  Yeah .  OK .  Well , I don't mind .  Oh , we should read some more numbers , then .  Are we are we are we there ?  Are we at that point ?  More space than you can  We 've got two hours of space now .  Yeah .  In theory .  Assuming it 's recording anything .  OK .  Yep .  ",,
Bmr002.D,"Well  Write down that poem .  Let us know when you 're done , though  cuz we want to start the meeting .  Now , how do you do the mike ?  I keep getting it in my nose .  Oh !  Oh ! This is good .  Oh ! I like this .  I like this .  I like this ,  this is much more comfortable .  I could have it more at the midline .  Boy ! It 's very adjustable now .  I 'm on number four .  May I pass the folder to Dan ?  OK .  I 'm mike I 'm on mike four .  and it 's a very nice microphone ,  very modern .  I like it very much .  You didn't get the s head restraint with your system ?  I did modify my my mike uh distance from my speaking apparatus .  Slightly .  That 's a good way .  Should I draw a map ?  OK .  He 's labelling he 's labelling right now .  Now .  OK .  We have what ? What do we have ?  Well done .  Well done .  You 're probably wondering why I brought you all here today .  Yeah .  Good .  Shall I n  I 'd like to hear one  Yeah , I 'd like to hear one more .  Could I hear you next ?  OK .  So , basically they 're kind of like sentences but with n numbers instead of words .  OK .  So , I 'm I 'm on uh number four with the microphone around my neck  and I will read these .  OK .  It really sounds like sentences .  Your intonation sounds like somewhat like sentence intonation .  OK .  Yeah ?  Um ,  OK .  If I were to be dictating a phone number , I would have done that more slowly ,  but uh which would have been easier for the of course , for the machine .  But . Was that an OK pace ?  OK .  Just as long as it 's with you know , uh within the constraints .  Number four .  Oh , Sorry .  and the voice .  Just no way .  Yes .  Oh , you did .  Oh .  Um , because my name was was mentioned when I wasn't around ,  but I 'm most happy .  Oh , uh he did .  and and I approved .  but I think that I was uh proposed before I was asked ?  And that doesn't matter  cuz I think there was probably an a uh y an indication that that I was interested in advance  and , in which case , I thank you .  Yeah .  I 'm going to provide I 'm going to be  once I 'm given the data , I will provide w word - level transcripts with uh indication of speakers ,  and um  I guess speaker change in any case ,  so speaker ID ,  and words .  Yeah .  Well  I 've transcribed a lot .  But um e you know , the I mean , there are always ways of doing things more efficiently or more uh in a more technical technically sophisticated way ?  Do you have to speak true English sentences when you do this ?  "" She can't speak ! ""  "" It 's terrible ! ""  OK , So um  Yeah .  "" No one told me that . ""  "" This microphone , what 's this doing around my neck ? ""  OK , so um typically , what I w you know I in uh i what I 've done before is I have a uh tape recorder , with a reverse button .  And you just , you know , if it 's word level e you know , you do a e a r I just hit the r re the rewind button every couple of words  and type what I know  and then and then at the end do a breeze through to be sure that everything 's correct .  However , they do have software these days which with a digitized uh record you can have control over replay through some sort of an interface .  Um . I 've never used one of those .  I know it would be an a wonderful idea .  It 's just I haven't transcribed in in awhile .  I mean  Foot pedals ? I 've used transcribing machines .  That 's fine .  um But I frankly didn't find it any more use to me than my hand - held taperecorder .  However , if we have a transcribing machine I would accept it .  The other thing is , you know , having getting hold of a transcriber .  I think that CogSci has one .  And I could probably borrow one .  You have one yourself ?  Oh , I see !  Oh , super !  Oh , I see .  OK .  Oh , OK .  I kn  Oh , that 'd be super .  This is great .  This sounds wonderful .  I 'm I 'm open to  Yeah , that 's true .  Well , you know  Now , we 're at a pilot phase right now ,  and what I was told is that beginning ,  you know , that the the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh or f you know half hour to forty minutes of running text .  And so , for the pilot thing , you know , of course this would be useful .  And I w I wou I 'm assu I 'm assuming that I would not be uh you know e eh uh transcribing all of it .  Yeah .  No .  No , no .  Yes .  Mm - hmm , yeah , OK , so now I 've I 've been involved with some of that . At at CogSci ,  ",,
Bmr002.D,"um So , Susan E Susan Ervin - Tripp , who you know um would typically , and I 've done this too , supervise undergrads to do this kind of thing  and they c you know , you can give them like  if you give them a little bit of instruction and and make it interesting for them they can do it as a two ninety - eight or s  or , not two ninety - eight , what is it , one whatever , undergraduate research credit .  Because what you do is , you can you know , build it into some sort of a  Well uh , you have to be sure you give them compensation for you know . of some of some sort .

So  Oh , But that 's a s  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  I should 've  Yes .  Are you speaking about Mississippi State per se ?  or are y  Yeah .  Actually , I wanted to mention There are two projects , which are international , huge projects focused on this kind of thing , actually .  One of them 's MATE ,  one of them 's EAGLES .  and um . And both of them have  You know , I saw I know you know about the big book .  I think you got it as a prize or something .  Got a surprise .  And um and they have you know , a lot of  and MATE is a project which is being run out of Denmark  and um they have a lot uh big uh , e  you know , they 're trying to set up a a work bench or something or other .  And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them .  So , I mean , there are things that in terms of like the time alignment issue  I mean , you guys are more expert on that , I mean , than I am ,  but I want to say that I know for a fact , I keep running across these ,  and those would be my first two choices of looking at . EAGLES and MATE .  And I have the documentation downstairs .  I didn't think to bring it .  Oh , I have ,  but I wasn't interested in that particular issue .  So , we 're talking now , once you have words you know , how do you time align it .  and that 's .  Well , these are uh tools  So , MATE and EAGLES are both within the so - called uh Language Engineering branch ,  and um so they 're intended for this kind of a comp compu s computer science application type of approach .  These are not discourse types of tools .  So . They  Can I be excused ,  and I 'll go down and get my stuff ?  because um I I do think  Are you serious ?

Both of these are Eur - European ,  but they have you know , American contributions , and stuff .  Yeah .  Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things .  What they 're doing is trying to bring together  and they rate things .  I wasn't focused on that  so I didn't  Let me show y  Have you seen this one , Dan ?  And I 'll try to get one for you , too .  Oh , you 've got one .  What are you looking at here ?  He 's got the Mark - up Framework .  Oh , yeah .  Different coding schemes .  OK .

Bmr002.D,"These things do seem to be  That 's the Text Encoding Initiative .  That 's a way of marking mark - up .  so , you know , but focus on tools to do this stuff  um , I do have a file also in addition to those things ,  but  it 'll take me just a second here  Well , yeah ,  I mean , if you start with a a basic transcription and a good filter . You can  I mean , that 's sort of my feeling about it ,  that you should be you should be able to translate between an XML and non - XML version  cuz most at least , you know , with a focus on discourse , mostly .  Oh ! I wanted to  This this approach here This is Uli Heid from Stuttgart  is um a query language for research in phonetics where he wants to build in ToBI tags  and so you can determine  um I wanted to mention this to you .

Well that 's what Morgan mentioned to me , too .  I mean , if in terms of the t the type  But you asked me about uh tools and things  and um There 's this one  um This is called "" Transcriber "" .  um "" binary distribution for for uh Linux and Solaris and SGI and Windows "" .  "" Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of speech corpora . ""  "" It allows to manually segment , label and transcribe speech signals ""  And ,  uh , let 's see ,  where did I get this ?  I got this from U Penn .  But  It is possible .  It could be French .  I can't really tell .  I 've never used any of them .  And so um I think it would be something that we should work uh together with , in terms of uh seeing how this  Here 's another thing I got .  OK .  Oh !  Good idea .  Great idea .  Excellent idea .  "" Automatic annotation of prosody in Verbmobil . ""  This is the other think that um This is part of EAGLES ,  but um ,  but here again , it 's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this .  Why do I feel like I 'm whispering ?  Oh !  I think that would be lovely .  Now , so , are we talking about the stage of uh simply the word stage ?  or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment as well ?  OK .  OK .  Absolutely .  Yeah ,  OK .  Good .  Oh good , OK .  Fine .  Oh , cool .  Very cool .  Cool .  Cool .  Yeah .  Cool .  Oh , cool !  OK .  There .  There you go .  I I love it when they  c  Did you see this one ?  The - , Did you see this one here ?  OK .  Whoa !  Yeah .  Well , I apparently ,  you know , I roam around on on topics like this  And I think I got this off the U Penn  and it does in fact cite a French site ,  so um they have some sort of an arrangement .  Good .  You - you can access it through um through the , uh , whatever  I can't remember which aspect of U of U Penn I was following ,  but It must have been the LDC .  I I I bet you anything .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yes .  Well there 's They have a special project , as I 'm remembering ,  and um , usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse ,  but they uh they show up in resources .  I like that very much ,  and I and I like the idea of also doing one that 's tied in with these larger corp corpus projects .  So that , you know , the fact that , yeah , it 's U Penn and all that .  Yeah .  Oh , good idea .  It 's like the PDA thing .  So , like "" did the French system use Tcl ? ""  if anyone wants to know .  But you could get it through the U Penn  Yes !  Yeah , there you go .  Exactly .  Well , my my impression  I I I really thought of these resources in the context of you you asking about time aligning the  you know , What would you need to indicate  and were there tools for that  because um I suspect that would be uh pretty time intensive .  I also wanted to say , in terms of like disc you know , if there are discussions about intonation contours I do have a certain amount of background in that  and I really would be I 'd like to be involved in that .  Yeah .  Oh , not right now ,  but I mean in the future .  ",,
Bmr002.D,"So at this meeting with Liz I you know , I mean  I I do I 'd like to I like that stuff .  So these are near near field ?  there  OK .  You know , if if we were to add in addition , and I 'm offering this , um to the word level , also the uh , so , stressed words , within utterances  I do think that that would help the information retrieval .  OK .  Oh , good point .  Do you think  So , are are you familiar with this the MARS the MARSEC project ?  Um , So , I 'll put this over here ,  cuz he seems to be the chairman .  Um .  Oh , he 's not ?  Well  Uh - huh .  He  Yeah .  Well , he can y y  discuss discuss among yourselves .  So , this is a project that um has time - aligned spoken data  which is um I see it as sort of in - between um these fields  because a lot of the time when people do rich um intonational and and stress - oriented transcription they don't have the digital record at the same time  and the don't have it time - aligned .  I don't know how large this is , actually .  But I just was sort of thinking that um I 'm I 'm  and it 's British  And you know  So .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I 'm d  Mm - hmm .  OK .  One thing about that is that is that um in the process of of doing the word level ? it really is just as easy to put the stress in at that point .  simply the stressed  Oh , oh ,  well , see in my pilot stuff ,  so in the half hour or so that I 'm doing . I 'd just as soon put it in ,  because I do think that you 'd find that those would be words  I mean You know of course , Rosaria 's pursuing this this area  but I really do think from everything that I 've run across that um you you should get gain in terms of the uh uh what you were saying ,  the information retrieval aspects from that .  And I wouldn't be too surprised  I mean , it 's it 's like uh  I mean I don't know how how reliable Lea is ,  but if this idea of islands of of um for di whatever they are .  r r islands of reliability or whatever it is .  The stressed w stressed words .  Is that it ?  OK .  I mean  The claim that uh words that get stressed are easier to recognize .  So , I mean , I I think it c there 's be sort of a benefit with very minimal input .  Cuz when you listen to a sentence , you can tell If it 's contrastive stress  you say "" Oh ! that word was stressed ""  and why the heck not put it in at the word level ?  So so , I mean , the part that I 'm doing , I 'm really happy to supply that without any  cuz it it 's just it 's there .  It 's not it doesn't take any thinking .  I 'm not going to talk about , you know uh , trying grade them in any kind of careful way ,  but just indicate if th if there 's a prominent word , to indicate it .  Whatever .  Whatever .  People  Yeah , people do different different ways ,  a and so just as long as it 's systematic in my view , you can always filter it into some other format .  How many of these do you have ,  these near mikes ?  Oh , OK .  OK .  Oh .  Oh , I see .  OK .  I see .  Interesting .  Very interesting .  Wow ,  I 'm just really impressed by this ,  um , yeah .  Well , this is , I mean , compared to the way people normally do , like , discourse stuff ?  you know , it 's like you got your  I mean they 've gotten away from w reel - to - reel tapes ,  but  and they do have DAT recorders ,  I mean you do have  but I mean this is just wonderful , the uh added level of yeah , compactness in the channels .  I do find myself whispering .  I mean , I suspect My normal s .  I don't know why .  It 's bizarre .  yeah , this is not really my normal pattern .  I think the problem is that I 'm afraid that I 'm talking into someone 's ear .  I really do .  So it 's so it 's like  And I realize now that you have volume uh control .  But uh  Yeah .  Oh good .  OK .  Good .  I 'm glad .  Good .  That 's great .  Are these more expensive or less expensive than this kind ?  OK .  It would be like the television . effect or something , maybe .  That 's probably why I thought he was the chairman .  Oh good .  Good .  Good .  Here , here !  OK , this is Jane .  OK .  Alrighty .  ",,
Bmr008.A,"Yeah , I do it My head 's too big , also .  It 's too ba  Oh , that 's true .  course that 's true of a lapel as well .  Can you just write something like "" position "" ?  and people can fill in their own you know , "" Post - doc "" or "" visitor "" or whatever .  oh .  Can you repeat the categories you had ?  Maybe they 're fine .  So that , yeah , I think that 's fine except the one thing is there are a lot of ICSI v  like I don't know what I would be here ,  just I 'm not a professor  I 'm not a  So so anything that , like a Visitor r ICSI Visitor or , ICSI y  I mean a Visiting S Researcher or whatever .  So if if we can put something  Yeah , that then then I think what you have is great .  for for that purpose and  or just  You could say  Wait , what 's a PHD ?  Like , if you have a PHD and you 're hanging around here , and you 're not a professor and you 're not a post - doc , then that 's like what we are so There 's a bunch of people like that .  Right .  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  So , you can say Post - PHD Researcher or what if there 's one more category that 's sort of general like that .  You - I think you could keep Professor , but you could say Post PHD Researcher or something .  No , instead of Post Post - doc or Post - PHD , just wrap all the people that are post PHD and non - professors together .  I think professors probably want it  I don't care .  Yeah .  Well , yeah the Post - PHD one is the one that can be , like Post - Post - doc or Post - PHD Researcher or whatever .  Yeah .  Then it 'd be fine .  I think it 's fine .  Yeah .  Wait , why is that optional ?  I don't know .  It it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes .  I mean a lot of corpora  yeah , so we ca we have these age ranges or something ?  You know , like  No , not at all ,  every most corpora have that , you know , information .  yeah , that 's OK .  Age or Approximate Age .  So somebody can say "" thirties "" if they 're thirty - nine .  Well , those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you  so maybe you 'll prefer to  Yeah , people can leave it blank if they  I I think people in Speech are gonna wanna  They can always lie .  OK , in some sense you could say that "" Please leave blank but but don't lie . ""  Right .  Well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known but it says "" optional "" they might not .  Anyway , it 's fine  I don't know .  OK .  Yeah , it 's OK .  As long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional , if there are a lot of other optional things on the form .  That 's that 's the only optional thing ,  OK .  So what does Region mean  and like if I see this form I wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by Region .  Do you want to have give choices and have them circle one , or ,  I mean  but I mean .  yeah maybe not for the others , because there aren't going to be enough people to really group them  and you know when you talk about dialects in England , I mean , that 's really  Every block of London has a different  so .  My Fair Lady 's  I I there are huge differences you know in the others  so it might be better to just do it for the  yeah you could leave region for for the others but have circled choice for the American English .  Right .  Actually that is true for them  but it means that you 're gonna get a bunch of different level levels of resolution in your survey , it it 'll be more of a pain later ,  so .  It depends .  Yeah , that that 's good  but if you have it totally free - form First of all some people take you  Well , and some people would give you more specific information than others  and that 's a waste because you can only use the least common denominator of specificity and generally .  I don't know  later on , if if somebody just says Midwest , now all these other people who said you know area then that 'll have to become your category .  and it 's It 's harder later on , i I It 's easier for the person  but it 's harder for the r  it actually less informative for us  because you can't enforce any minimum level of specificity .  so it 's  Or their parents live  yeah .  and their parents  If we release this corpus , what do we want ,  I mean if you do this free form um the free form solution where some questions are very open - ended then you need someone needs to enter that ,  and they 'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use that without mapping it .  It 's OK .  But it 's  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  I mean , I guess what you really want , is if there 's some information you wanna know  ",,
Bmr008.A,"So we want some rough idea of their dialect , basically .  then we should have some question where it 's not free form , except for these people who are who have non - American English accents .  There we probably have to have a category "" Non - American English "" and then a few choices .  And we should have something that 's simple , that people can circle , like these TIMIT regions or something , so that we have something that minimally you can  cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that 's what people are gonna use .  They 're gonna want some small set of places ,  and then , but anything additional people can fill out , and we can put it in as a note or something ,  but if we don't have that , someone 's gotta sit there and figure out you know , I 've got twenty people who said Midwest ,  and I 've got a few people who said something else  and these don't overlap or these  Oh , OK , so  yeah as long as you have  Well , in the home , the influence of the home is much lower age than that ,  I mean once you go beyond the age five or six then it 's the the school influence as well and and  yeah ,  so In the home it 's sort of your phonetic first level ,  um a - So it 's you know it starts to get sort of complicated .  Right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Most of but most of those people don't rely on the self - evaluations , anyway .  They 'll probably listen to the speech ,  so  But even you know in Switchboard , I I remember looking really carefully at  They have information sort of like TIMIT  I don't know it 's how well they categorized ,  but they had North Atlantic , Mid - Atlantic , and  You know , Texas was definitely out on  I mean most of the people from cer certain places in the South were from specific Texas locations ,  but other than that you had a huge range of  You know , people would say Boston , and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent .  So it was  Um No , the question was really geared towards trying to get people 's self - evaluation of their dialect region .  and you know , for instance , you know , Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally  these were all settled by very different type people ,  so it it 's sort of a general help  but I think that anyone who 's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that , they would probably use it as a first pass or something ,  Well , I think we do need to make sure about the f the non - native accents because those are , you know  but we don't need to ha be really really specific about the others , because it won't be very w helpful anyway .  I think we should , because other databases do .  It 's sort of a political thing .  And there are some general  like , you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category .  but it 's not  Right .  But Other is there , and people will fill that out .  They 'll see by example .  Yeah that 's I think that 's fine ,  they 'll say oh , I 'm not one of these ,  I 'm Canadian , or  Right .  I mean , even like Cal - LA is totally different than  I mean , you really can't um  We could ask them for more information , but I don't think it 's necessary and it 's not going to solve this problem .  Oh yeah .  I mean , I think the question on regions is really to ask people how did they define their dialect region now ,  di  the whether they picked it up at the one age or another .  pretty much , I mean , most people will know whether they have a southern accent or not .  um , but they may have lived you know , in other places , too .  So if we ask the question about dialect regions , it makes no sense to say where do you live now .  Right ?  You ask how would you best define your your accent or your dialect style .  OK  Or you could say to somebody , how do you define your your the accent that you have .  um And then you can ask these other questions as well ,  but what we don't want them to think is that they 're living in a certain place  and that therefore they 're  I mean , nowadays hardly anybody from California has a native Californian accent ,  so .  OK ,  as long as it 's clear .  OK .  OK .  OK .  Yeah ,  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Sounds good .  Mm - hmm .  Sounds good .  It it gets into a can of worms .  I mean , the more you ask , the more you realize that you 're not getting great answers to what you 're asking and  So .  What about proficiency in English ? as well ?  I  You don't want to do it for political reasons ,  I mean I 'm no I wasn't thinking about that ,  I was just thinking , "" Gee , I 'd like to know actually ""  Oh , OK .  OK .  Well , so maybe that 's  Maybe we maybe we shouldn't ask it ,  I don't know .  What about something like "" How comfortable are you in a meeting conducted in English ? "" ,  or "" How easy is it for you ? "" ,  ",,
Bmr008.A,"or something like that where it 's  Yeah , that 's a good one .  Something  wha what do you think ,  what 's it  I mean  How  yeah ?  How long have you been in an English speaking country .  OK .  How about their birthday ?  I don't know .  I mean , not not the year not the year  not the year but just their birthday .  I don't know ,  what are the chances of people having the same name .  They  So thi Isn't this an open - ended , like basically a notes column ?  I mean you can imagine wanting you should be able always to attach some notes to  is this the the place where we would do that , or is there another place .  I think that starts to There 's definitely some clear cases ,  but there are a lot of gray areas , where the context happens just in that meeting ,  or ,  I mean , where you don't wanna sort of have to make a distinction between a pre - existing relationship , or  But I mean , there are some that generalize over many meetings and there are some that don't , and there are some things that happen in between meetings ,  and  I think this one needs to be open - ended ,  completely open - ended ,  and the only concern I would have is if there 's something we wanna be able to say and we can't put it in that field .  So you mean like  Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub  I don't know what you would call them , but little labels for things that we decide are useful things to have  but You know , as long as we have this one place where it can all be stored , then we 're fine , I think .  and those 'll probably occur I mean , to us , we 'll think of a few of them , some other researcher will think of some totally different keyword .  Y Yeah , it 's it 's it 's gonna change  It 's gonna change ,  and maybe we wanna regroup things under different labels later ,  if we figure out that these pairwise things are  But are we assuming that you could know the energy for a speaker when there 's no overlap ?  I mean I can imagine a model where you say , OK , you know I 'm I 'm gonna give myself  it 's cheating ,  but not completely if they 're often not overlapping and normalized for the speaker  or is that not allowed .  I mean , what 's the  right  right  Right , right .  Right .  That 's what makes it seem difficult ,  because you 're already left with a high standard deviation  and they 're already roughly  so that each person 's hearable ,  right ?  so sort of equally loud , perceptually anyway .  Yeah , like two hundred milliseconds  or twenty to twenty - five frames ,  or  or voiced regions ,  I mean can we tell ?  can we sorry I mean , is it known whether something 's voiced here , or is it roughly estimate estimateable ?  I mean like if one speaker 's voicing and the other one isn't and they 're overlapping , do we know that the first speaker 's voicing , or not ?  Mm - hmm .  But will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap ?  That 's what I just wondered .  OK .  So if we could , or if you could do some of it ,  yeah ,  then um , voiced regions would be , like , probably more informative , for energy  because  and pi and pitch for that matter .  Well , it 's the fifth page , I guess .  It has to tell you .  It has to give you at least a zero , one ,  I mean uh d binary  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .  You can also look at just the voiced regions later .  I mean , that would be the most sensitive measure .  because you know , if you 're normalizing for voiced , and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is , um , you should be much more sensitive to the to the overlaps then if you  you know if you normalize but you look everywhere at at at fricatives or something you won't really know anything .  So I mean assuming if it 's true that the overlap regions are sort of long enough that there 's some voicing in each of them , by each of the speakers , then you should do very well if you do this .  But you 'll only know that in the re voiced regions  but those are close enough to the  You know , there 's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing and if you can capture it when there 's overlap then you should do quite well there .  I think also the harmonics would be very important .  So if you can find voiced regions and  You know , if you have two speakers and they 're both voicing  unless they have very similar , you know , pitch , you should be able to see the difference in harmonics pretty clearly  just by counting them ,  I mean  yeah , so even if you 're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there 's some non - voiced regions , at least you can have these islands of reliability where you 're pretty sure .  Right ,  and you could put an estimate estimate , you know , a fuzzy start and end time .  ",,
Bmr008.A,"Well , it 's sort of good , though , if you 're for for your accuracy .  Uh , Gives you a little more time to try to detect them .  Yeah , something  somethin something like that  too .  ",,
Bmr008.B,"OK Yeah .  OK so let 's uh  Let 's discuss agenda items .  What did we have ?  uh You you were announce some things  OK , forms is one thing  uh , there 's status on on the uh transcription discussion which will take us about thirty seconds  uh and then uh Jose as usual uh , the one among us who 's actually doing a bunch of things on this  uh He has this and I think we can have some  I was just glancing through it , so I think we have something to discuss about .  um and um We just sent in that uh NSF pre - proposal  but I don't think there 's much to say about that except we 've sent it in and we 'll see what happens  um Anybody ?  Anything ?  Anything else going on ?  No .  OK .  So Why don't we do it in that order ?  Go ahead .  How fine a resolution do you need on that for this ?  I mean maybe not so much .  P prone .  Yeah .  No , no .  Less .  Um , Hmm um well , do you think there 's  I don't really know .  I mean , were you thinking , uh , that it would be useful for some research later to know say , you said undergrad for instance , so , undergrad versus grad ,  do you think that 's important ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  I see .  I  DTD ?  Oh .  Oh , OK .  See  yeah  yeah  Right .  How about Yeah , how about Post - PHD researcher or something  Right ?  Yeah .  Yeah so for for me there 's there 's a There are people  Um , this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the Spanish program actually  because uh , when we said , in our original forms , "" post - doc "" what we were used to , from the German program and from the US standard , when you say "" post - doc "" it meant somebody who had just gotten a PHD who was doing one year someplace .  But when we did the Spanish call , many people said "" oh I want to be uh have a post - doc slot "" and they were twenty years out  because they were "" post "" their "" doc ""  so  I I I think that  It might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting is really I think it 's going to be so clouded by everything else  Someone who 's just gotten their PHD uh , could be very very uh , strongly opinionated about something and somebody who 's been twenty years out could be shy , you know , s  What 's "" Other "" ?  so you want Professor to be in a separate category ,  you think you think uh think think we  So , I 'm te I 'm tending to push toward simpler  even though I know that more detailed means more potential information for someone later who 's doing research in in this area  I uh The the the thing making me lean toward simpler where possible is that uh the more a thing  Many of the meetings that we record uh , may be the kind where we just record somebody once  even though we want to get a lot of data that has uh , many meetings with the same people .  And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms that 's th the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do .  Right . That 's what we 've done so far .  Right .  And so I 'm saying I expect us to do both kinds .  Yes .  So I 'm saying there are going to be What I imagine once we 've collected a lot of data , a chunk of it will be uh , the same people many times  and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with from different people  and I think it 's use We 've talked about this before , it 's useful to have both kinds of data . I think .  OK .  OK .  Well , wait wait wait wait a minute ,  um , It 's not illegal or anything  right ,  it 's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal , whatever , to ask for their age ,  right ?  So  I suggest you ask for their age  and if they say I don't want to give it say OK .  I see .  O opt age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones ?  The the mean of the estimates from the group will be used  They might lie anyway .  I don't know .  I mean I mean the peop the people I 've known who 've lied about it I think would just lie about it .  Oh yeah .  Hey , Jack Benny was thirty - nine for forty years .  kinder and gentler .  I don't think it matters .  I I don't think it matters .  If it makes you more comfortable , put Optional  I I don't think it 's  Then  I I I don't think it 's important but I also don't think it 's an important point the other way  and I don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it .  So .  Now what was this thing that  who was telling  was it Steve ?  Somebody was telling us about asking about uh ,  Uh - huh  I I I 'm sorry , so you 're saying  uh I I I just missed something , though .  Are you saying that you have both ?  ",,
Bmr008.B,"that you 're saying , uh what is your  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , and Henry Higgins could say which block you were from .  Right ?  So that 's  What  what about just doing the the sort of the Steve suggestion , uh , as as an add - on to it ,  right ?  Rather than saying Region , just say "" Where did you live between the ages of here and here ? ""  Just  And then they they could s  Right yeah , they could say it different ways .  They could say Cincinnati or they could say Midwest or  Somebody 's gonna have to do some data  Yeah but that but the good thing about it is it is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right categories are .  um , Right ?  Yeah .  I see .  But I think that if you 're going to have it be general uh ,  so the idea again was , you know , you might wanna also know if if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up  and so uh , I think you wanna The idea the motivation I think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might um  you know , if you say your native language was was English but uh you you grew up in Germany , uh I think this  Yeah , and the question is how extensive this gets .  But but  What about the the phrasing that um Chuck used , uh which was in in relation to the question I was trying to formulate of uh Where where did you what  what was that what w how did you phrase it ?  "" What language was spok "" ,  yeah , so it 's not where did you grow up , but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of , what would it be , five and twelve or something like that ?  cuz he does make a good point about the region  not necessarily again , if you 're on the army base or  Yeah .  For now ,  right  so it 's I mean , again , we are hoping to expand this out ,  yeah .  And somebody might .  Right .  Yeah .  So internally , we have Texas and other .  mm - hmm  um so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood in there .  Well you could distinguish between pre - five and five t five to twelve ,  right ?  So depending on what someone 's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of categories or whether or whether you 're talking more about their linguistic speech patterns ,  you know uh  so  But , again , it depends how fine we wanna get ,  but we could say uh "" where did you live before you were five ? "" ,  "" where did you live after you were five ? "" ,  I don't know .  yeah  Right .  Right .  OK .  Why don't we try it out . and see see what kind of responses we get from people .  Anyway .  d I  yeah .  Uh , I  I wasn't thinking  oh No , no .  I wasn't thinking political at all .  I was just saying , looking at applications of people over the years for post - docs here .  They 're r generally not very good at assessing their own abilities .  but  That could be .  That could be .  Yes .  Good ,  Bad .  How b How About "" How long have you been uh in in an English speaking country ? ""  Yeah  Really ?  Yeah .  Yes .  We done ?  Yeah .  Oh , there 's another form .  No , you got what 's the other form ?  In case people what ?  Oh .  Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time , someone 's email could change .  Oh yeah , that 's bad .  Thanks  Oh , I see .  Then , you don't hafta ask the age .  Yeah .  Social social security number .  I Maybe I was missing something maybe ,  but I mean this is something one would try to infer ,  but how do how would you How would you freeze that information about what , uh ,  I mean , we already have these things about someone 's a professor and someone 's a student , or something ,  but would you would you Some person would be writing OK this person was leading the meeting and that was or or  is that what you mean , or  What what what uh ,  Oh , so you 're just putting preexisting relationships that are  I see .  yeah .  Yeah , I m  Right , but that example was not  Yeah .  So , I mean , for today , for instance ,  this is the second meeting recorded today .  The first meeting was a was a front - end meeting ,  and in that one , the basic form of that was uh , I was the leader ,  and I was saying uh , "" what are the results you 've gotten in the last week ? ""  And they were and uh one person was sort of taking the lead , in describing what the results were ,  and then uh , Chuck was taking the role of saying , "" well , what did you mean by that ? "" ,  so he was sort of like the out s semi - outsider , asking curiosity questions .  And then it would come back to me with saying "" well , you know , you showed me that but you know , I think you should do this in the future , ""  ",,
Bmr008.B,"so it was very much sort of "" Leader "" and and and and "" Led "" sort of relationship .  And um the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is is a visiting researcher , uh , in this l meeting , uh , you are my graduate student ,  but uh it 's not taking that kind of role at all ,  right ?  You 're you 're you 're actually leading the meeting for the most part , most of this meeting ,  so it 's  Yeah , well , whatever .  So Uh Yeah , so I I don't know ,  so you 're suggesting  Right , cuz it seems like it 's sort of a  Exactly .  It 's sort of a research question , you you 're analyzing the meeting and you 're deciding , "" ah , there 's this kind of structure to it . ""  Yeah .  So it sounds like having the facility is great ,  and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be generally useful  and it it sounds like a good thing to do .  Almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group  uh and uh you know and a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning ,  so this is not a lot of people .  We could easily There 's just a couple other meetings that  Yeah .  OK , so we 're running kind of late ,  so we 'll probably wanna zip through some other things , maybe do some more time on on Jose 's stuff later ,  um uh Status of Transcription ,  Uh , I guess , you know , we we recently woke up um our friends  and uh  so I I guess you 've sent off this the uh CD - ROMs  and you got some response from from uh IBM about  Yeah .  Was there some suggestion that they might soon , or  Yeah .  McCoond  Yeah .  Great , OK .  Well , that was that one .  Um ,  um , and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you , off - line Jose  cuz it 's getting kind of late  but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there 's there 's a lot of overlap , in just energy related things  and so you need something else .  I mean , that 's sort of  right ?  And uh what the so I 'd  The residual error ?  OK , so this is post bug fix .  Good , OK .  So um so I had two thought just glancing through this .  So , one is one is that um that uh we might wanna talk about normalization .  I mean , I don't know what normalizations you use .  Sometimes things have more overlap before you 've done some kind of normalization  and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible .  And the other thing is that , if that isn't @ @ uh so much of the issue , then probably  I mean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very closely related , even though they 're different  and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at i in some sense harmonicity , or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it , for instance ?  You know , so if if there 's uh a really bad fit between where the pitch is going in this suppose uh hypothesized region of overlap , and the the and one or the other uh side , you know , then this this this might uh , suggest a  Excuse me ?  I if you have two if you have two if you have uh two people speaking uh and there 's an overlap , then I mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics uh during overlapped voice sections anyway .  And um the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence , it 's also going to be a smaller fraction .  This is , you know , related to the harmonicity sort of thing .  And then the other thing I 'm saying is that if you look at the temporal evolution of the pitch there should be something like a discontinuity there .  Now , there 's other places where you 'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech ,  but but maybe it 'll have something to have a different character .  But it seems like energy energy tells you something ,  but uh if unless this is a normalization problem , it looks from your results like there 's so much overlap that certainly you need something that isn't energy - like , in addition to it , at least .  OK , so the question is is would some kind of normalization help .  You know , uh , i i it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall um energy uh for uh you know some some longer period of time or something , uh that that there would be more of a distinction .  uh , I I don't know .  Which is the intuition ,  un unfortunately there 's a standard deviation of like ten ,  so For each one ,  yeah .  Well , that 's what I was suggesting , that y you wanna do some kind of longer time normalization eh with the  even if you make a mistake occasionally , that that i is roughly i is there some corresponding to that speaker , so that if you , if if uh if you  ",,
Bmr008.B,"because that that 's gonna spread out these distributions really a lot , to not do any kind of normalization ,  and so that that could mask the effect somewhat .  So that 's why it doesn't add up down  I have another another thought .  Um , this is this is frame energy ,  of course frame frames have a lot of variance to them  because different sounds are different loudnesses .  So I mean , what if you took uh one second chunks or something like that .  Or or maybe not even a second ,  maybe a quarter of a second or something ,  so that you would typically have two or three basically syllable kind of length  Yeah .  Right .  So then you you 'll you know  Something ,  yeah .  So so I mean , so you know two hundred , three hundred four hundred mill  some longer chunk of time ,  and then you looked at the amount of energy in that .  and how does that vary over these different cases .  or voiced regions .  Well , I mean , you could do a you could first determine that something was voiced or not .  Well , I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time  and so uh there could be voiced and non - voiced pieces during the overlap .  I don't know ,  because it 's it 's this this has to do with these questions of harmonicity , and so forth ,  right ?  Yeah .  Right , so you could do something like , uh  but  Sure .  But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of time .  Cuz if you look over a large enough region of time , most of the time you 'll have some voiced a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it .  And so I think that would be  Is it ?  What ?  Are you using a pitch detector in this yet , in your experiments ?  Do you have a pitch detector that you 're using ?  Do you do you have a a pitch detector that you are using in these experiments ?  Yeah .  Does does it have a voiced , unvoiced uh detector in it ,  uh ?  It doesn't .  it just finds the pi it just finds the pitch even when it 's unvoiced ?  I mean , it must have some It has to tell you something ,  right ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah . So ordinarily in these things , it does tell you that it 's it 's voiced with a pitch of such - and - such .  And it will i i it will say something like zero  or you know it 'll have something that it says when it 's when it can't find a good good uh uh period ,  right ?  So it 's looking for some periodic behavior ,  and if it can't find a period it tells you for for most things like that .  So I mean , this is , getting back to what Liz was suggesting  which I think actually is good , the more I think of it ,  that that um for normalization you could do something like take voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that .  I 'm just still going back to normalization , that even though it 's roughly normalized , uh , for overall gain , I think it it 's it it may not be normalized enough .  Uh , for both ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK , so so I think I mean , @ @ this is something to to experimentally determine ,  but I mean , if um u  as I understand it , you have you have some regions that uh um are marked , as  You have training data that you 're trying to find a threshold ,  right ?  and so um um if you take um all the things all the uh speak things marked "" SPK "" , and uh look for the voiced uh energy in them ,  and uh  well , just in in each case , take a take a take a frame ,  take the  uh uh  if it 's if it 's voiced , include it ,  Just separate out from the from the normal things ,  separate out voiced .  Right ?  Then you 're gonna end up with uh a a uh a mean uh standard devia deviation , and so forth .  And then do your normalization based on that .  And once you do that just for voiced ,  um um  I guess you 'd  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Right .  w  Yeah .  You could do that ,  yeah .  I mean , be i And if they still overlapped , i i the  But but I I think that this is a good first thing , to just sort of see .  And and what this says is that th that without any special normalization at least , this is there 's a lot of overlap here .  And so I mean coming back to Jose 's question ,  I mean there 's still this issue of of of how much time  I mean  What do you look at in order to normalize ?  I mean , dur you you get some data in , you don't know which it is , how do you how do you W w what period of time do you look over to normalize it by ?  And and uh , that 's that 's something to think about and experiment with .  Yes .  Right , so that 's what we were talking about before with harmo with harmonicity measure .  Yeah . So .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh , well .  Good .  ",,
Bmr008.B,"Yeah .  Yeah , and I I  I don't know .  I I wanna think about it  and you should think about it .  I I I didn't want to just pop out an answer  because I realized I I hadn't thought about it enough .  I 'm not sure .  Well , what he 's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue , for F - seek .  Yeah , cuz I think in I mean , in general F - seek works ,  so it 's  Yeah , Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .

Sorry .  OK .  ",,
Bmr008.D,"Or , I like it , also , like this .  So you see the  So .  I should have brought more  I have a couple things about speaker form  about forms in general .  Stuff .  OK .  I uh probably should have printed out more of these .  So one of the things that I 've been doing with the digits forms is I 've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them  and it 's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time .  So , what I thought was , it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once .  And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form .  so , I had a first pass of it ,  and I spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff  and so I have a first pass at it .  And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it .  And I only did one copy which was really stupid of me .  um So I 'll just sort of say what it 's on and then I can hand it around .  So the top of it is uh , Name , Sex Email or Other Contact Information .  And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name , so that you can distinguish them ,  and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form .  And then , uh , we talked a little bit about whether to do how we get at the background .  And we could do profession , but it 's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level .  um At least that would get at some idea of their background .  So I have a And s  and relevant to status .  So that what I have is uh  So uh , I have uh , five things that you can circle ,  Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , and then Other , with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there 's some Other .  So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors , who are not used to the US education levels .  and may need some help to translate what that means .  Mm - hmm .  Well , the problem with that is um , I think the same as the problem of profession .  That it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down "" speech researcher "" or or something at that granularity .  So I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th At least I don't feel like there is .  um I think the only question is whether the what categories should there be .  Less .  Right .  Well , one of the one of the criteria I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet .  And so we 'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also .  Is I did not want to have to , you know come down and quiz each person and have a uh social dynamics expert being the one who 's filling out the answers .  I want it to be self - evaluating .  You can give it to them and they can understand what you 're asking .  Yep .  That 's a separate question .  So , we 'll We 'll get to that in a moment .  And this particular form  I know .  So , this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker ,  not on the meeting .  You could imagine then having another form that you might want to do during a meeting to get out the relationships  But then that 's interfering with the meeting .  So , what I like about this information is you give it to them once , and they fill it out once ,  and and then you have that information .  Not at all .  I mean , the fact that one person 's an undergrad and the other 's a full professor is interesting .  So , the question is how much of this information um , can y  Well , absolutely !  But but you want to have that information .  Right ?  So , if you don't have that information , how are you gonna do anything ?  I mean , so what would you suggest ?  Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , Other  oh , that 's right ,  you know I was saying "" Professor "" .  Uh - huh .  Yeah , when I said "" Professor "" , I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more "" PHD but not Post - doc "" .  and Or maybe Post - doc change "" Post - doc "" to "" PHD "" ?  Because I think PHD and Professor are d are distinct  aren't they ?  Someone who has a PHD .  So , maybe Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD and Other ?  um , other  If i Instead of instead of instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ?  So , as I said Undergrad  Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other ?  Right .  Well , the whole reason that I 'm doing it this way is is uh my experience so far has been the exact reverse .  That  Right .  I guess we could have another type of form for less frequent .  ",,
Bmr008.D,"Well I think that if if we 're planning to do that , then we should probably have another set of forms .  You know , a single form that 's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do digits .  This is a topic I want to bring up after I get through this .  So , that that that 's another form that I want to discuss . um , with the digits forms .  So , s can we get  Mm - hmm .  That 's what I want to talk about in a  Yeah , I 'm I have that as a topic , also .  So , let 's finish with the speaker form speaker form and then we 'll get over o get over to that one .  So , Education Level , Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other .  OK ?  um and then I put "" Optional "" with a big "" Optional "" in parentheses , Age .  Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down .  So I don't want to make them feel like they have to .  Uh , sure . But if someone doesn't want to write it down I don't want them to say you can't record me  Well , I think that just having on the form saying Optional , Age , again means I don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this .  And having a little instruction sheet and say "" If you 're in this age range do this , and if you 're in this rage do that . ""  So .  Yeah , right .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I think maybe that 's because no one here is sensitive about their age .  But , I would rather let them leave it blank than lie .  So that 's why I want to put That 's why I want to put s "" Optional , Age "" ,  so that if they don't want to put it , they leave it blank .  But if you put "" Optional "" , won't they just leave it blank rather than lie ?  OK .  You don't think they 'd just leave it blank if it says has a big "" Optional "" right next to it ?  It It I think it 's better to put "" Optional "" .  I mean , that 's why I put it there , s  but it seems like maybe you disagree .  Mm - hmm .  Well I didn't mark anything else as specifically optional ,  So .  Um , and then the next are two sections  One indented separately .  So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers .  OK , so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English with three circle boxes  American , British , Indian and Other , for write - in .  Yep . Jane and I discussed this , and it was it was again the same problem  that it 's gonna be a self - evaluation anyway ,  and so I don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them "" Well , do you mean that your native an l an language was British when you were born , and then it changed to American when you were two , and then it changed to "" and so on .  Right .  I mean , th there 's room on the form to put al a a line of instruction , but I 'm just not sure what it re should really be .  So the the for the non - na for the native English speakers we have Variety of English and Region .  And that 's it .  And then we have another form later down which is um , list other language influences .  Right , neither would I .  Um , I don't think we can do that because it would be different for  If you 're American English it would be region of the US .  That that so that 's why I didn't have circle forms .  Because it would be different depending on what your language is .  So  It - I think it would be however you would identify your own .  And , as I said I don't really see a way of doing a circle fill in , because there would be there would have to be one for American English , one for British English , one for you know , one for each type .  But but that would mean I would have to do generate a different form for circles , if you 're American English or British English or Indian English .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I just don't know what to do about the other varieties of English .  Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down .  Well , there could be a circle one .  Right ?  So , you could say "" What region did you grow up in from these years ? ""  and have a set of circ of six or seven circles  Yeah .  What language was spoken in the home ?  Depends of who you ask , what the age range is .  Yeah , so this is why I  So so th  Well , the way it 's phrased right now , it 's clearly asking about language .  And so , what it 's trying to get at is what you think you speak .  Now , I think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak .  ",,
Bmr008.D,"But , other than having a trained linguist interview them and ask these very specific questions , I don't see a way around it .  Because as you said , what you 're gonna have to stay say is "" Well , list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it ,  and now list the ones in preschool  and now list the ones in first grade  and now list the ones your friends speak ""  Right .  So I want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking f uh forty - five minutes .  So I think that adding the the TIMIT categories is a good idea ,  because that 's very easy for a person to fill out .  But I think we still have this problem of is it gonna be a self - evaluation ?  or are we gonna ask them "" what was it when you were four years old , or what was it when you were six years old , or what wher "" w  What 's the best way of phrasing the question ?  Or adapta or adaptation .  Well maybe should we just  Then maybe we shouldn't just shouldn't ask .  Well , maybe for the native English speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it 's that unreliable .  The other thing also is that I 'm asking for the variety of English , and I did just put American , British , Indian and other .  So , I didn't put Canadian , Australian , and all the other varieties .  e But do you think those three are OK ?  OK .  So that for the Eng - native English speakers , we 'll do variety of English , regions from the TIMIT labels , and another field .  And then  I thought this was be fast .  Air conditioning .  Right .  Right , the way the way the form reads now , I think it 's pretty clear that 's what we 're asking cuz it says "" Native English speakers , Variety of English , American , British , Indian , Other , Region "" .  And then we 'll have Southern English , you know , whatever whatever the TIMIT categories are .  So I think i if you look at this fr  Right .  Right , so I it seems to me that if you read this form , i w it 's pretty obvious that it 's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak ,  not where you live .  I mean , I don't say anything about where you live on the form .  So it 's just in the section talking about language .  Yeah .  And then uh , as Jane said , the last question is "" List other language influences , bilingual dialects , et cetera . ""  And that 's just and open - ended place for them to do .  And then  And then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out , for um the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in , since we 'll eventually anonymize  and this will be a form a place for us to connect the two .  And then the meetings that they attended ,  because there 'll be one form for each person .  OK . So .  Yeah , I guess I 'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff .  Right .  So , there 's another area which is non - native English speakers which asks for Native language , Region , and Variety of English .  And that 's it .  Proficiency .  That 's a good idea .  Well , do you think that 's That 's also because they know that it 's a re important for them to be good at it .  So , don't don't you think they overrate rather than underrate ?  So , but  no , I think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form .  The the question are what are what would the categories be ?  Yeah , I 'm I don't know .  Being totally monolingual , I 'm not the right person to ask , to talk about this  but it just seems to me that that doesn't the length of time doesn't really get at what we 're asking .  Right ?  It seems to be that asking about the proficiency , even if it 's self - rated , is what we wanna know .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  With that form .  Shall we wait for other forms later , or you Keep going more form  Uh , the other form is a modified digits form .  uh and it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple ,  it 's it 's very much what like the digits forms in front of us , except it doesn't ha ask for sex or native language .  Um , so it 's Name , Email , Time , Date , Seat , Session , Mike number , Channel , Mike type .  Uh , in case people have the same name .  So I wanted  Have the same name .  Yeah , I 'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in at Boeing .  So We could drop email .  I mean that 's not a big deal ,  it 's just uh  Right .  Well , the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an ID  but I hate it when people do that to me ,  when they say , here 's you ID ,  don't forget it .  ",,
Bmr008.D,"So , I I wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate .  Your mother 's maiden name mother 's maiden name  social security number ,  So , although the email email will change , I think that 's a good way of doing it .  We 'll be able to backtrack from email .  Um , and then the other thing I was thinking about and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form ,  but it it is something that some form about the individual meeting .  Now , the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out .  Just to pick up an arbitrary an example .  Right .  So th so the sorts of questions I had were one Who 's gonna fill it out , and who 's gonna take responsibility for filling it out in each meeting ,  I mean , will we re will we require it .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  And that was my other question , which is um what sort of information do we want to record ?  I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy .  You know , source , destination , relation .  Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ?  Right .  I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map mapping meetings concept is that 's another way of looking at looking at it .  So , are there anything other than pairwise ?  Oh yeah , OK .  Yes , shirt certainly .  I 've been thi I it seems to be that there is We could attach more structure if we wanted to .  Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships .  Um , just as an example , it would be , "" Source , Adam Janin "" , "" Destination , Morgan "" , "" Relationship , Advisor "" .  that are relevant .  Yep .  Right , so my example was not a good one , because that 's  Right .  Well , it 's just cuz it 's my turn .  Well , the D T Ds mean we can do whatever however we want it .  But what I what I was thinking uh the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open - ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common .  Especially with these pairwise ones , where you can describe them and pairwise .  And you might want a tool that used that information .  Sure , absolutely .  Right .  Right Well I think being being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of , that  So you 're football league was a good one .  So the ones I 've been thinking of are all sort of uh , power , responsibility .  I guess husband - wife is yet another one .  Ach !  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Some more .  OK .  Nope .  Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise ,  so that 's probably not sufficient .  Yeah , maybe not .  Yep . OK .  Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway .  So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it .  Right .  Right .  So it We can regenerate a lot of this information .  But Even if we can't , generate it , I think it 's alright to have some of the sections in your database blank , that this information was not collected for this meeting .  And there 's just not gonna be a way around that .  That 's just gonna happen  like the N S A meeting , the networks meeting .  I don't think they 're gonna want to fill out that information .  So .  OK , enough on forms .  They haven't received them yet ,  but I did get a response from them saying "" Yes we 're still alive ,  we haven't done anything yet . "" basically .  And uh  Yeah .  So so , they 've transferred the responsibility to someone else .  I can't remember his name McCoond ?  McCoond ?  Something like that ,  but uh  And so he sent me email and said he 's gonna be starting to work on it ,  and I haven't received anything else .  So .  So tomorrow I 'll send a email and just ask if he received it ,  he should be getting it today .  Actually he should have gotten it yesterday .  But . Give him a day .  Hmm .  And And And did is this from the mixed signal ?  OK , so there is some normalization already , in that they 've been volume equalized uh over the entire signal .  Right .  Right .  Well , but the mixed signal already has a normalization in it .  Well , I think it 'll be worse ,  right ,  I think the mixed  Or window it  hamming window .  Huh .  Right .  And he has on his graph something like forty percent .  It looked like fifty percent or more are point two seconds or longer overlap  It 's li I think the last page .  Nope , not the last page .  Where was it ?  It was one of the tables .  Fifth page .  Oh , it 's seventy - five percent !  Um And the length  It seems like with the overlaps being fairly long , that should make it easier .  That r that was an interesting statistic .  That they 're much longer than I expected .  ",,
Bmr008.D,"Ninety percent of them are over two m two hundred milliseconds .  It is good ,  but it 's uh but it surprised me .  Yes .  For example .  Two hundred milliseconds , hamming window .  Hmm .  Did you typecast to long ?  or size - T or whatever it is ?  I don't remember what it is .  One of the problems , if the file is large , um , and you 're cast to the wrong type .  Right , if you 're sending at an integer instead of a long .  Typecast from integer , "" int "" INT or long or unsigned long .  I think it 's  Yeah .  Well , It 's one possibility .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Shall we do digits ?  OK .  Are we done ?  Yes , OK .  OK , we are going off .  ",,
Bmr008.E,"Yeah I I just tried it .  I think my head is too big .  Oh yeah .  The distance isn't  Status ?  Oh oh , stats kind of status , OK .  Student , Non - student .  Sitting .  How about You could say , if you 're giving a talk , how likely are you to be challenged ?  Well , sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that .  You need to know sort of Bas - in in this meeting , sort of what is your social status ?  But but but it 's gonna depend on who 's  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I g  I guess I guess it seems to me like you know I trying to deduce information about the person 's status from the meeting independent form will be useless because  But , that will depend on what the meeting 's about ,  right ?  Let 's say the undergrad was an expert in physics , and  Mm - hmm .  I guess I 'm wondering how can you make a conclusion based on that , if you don't know about the meeting ?  I don't know .  I 'm just That 's why I was wondering about if you can put something about the d  For the European  Mm - hmm .  No , I like the idea of putting down the the status information  because I think you probably can get a lot of interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that .  I 'm wondering could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting that would somehow  Yeah .  OK .  Well I guess I was thinking maybe , you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ?  Could we put one more thing on here maybe ?  OK .  Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe  OK .  Oh , right .  Yeah .  How about  How about "" optional but highly desirable "" ?  Yeah , If not given we will estimate .  Yeah .  They 're very strong - willed .  You know ?  People He  I think I think you can put "" optional ""  it 's not gonna  You know people who lie about it ?  Yeah , I think it 's OK .  People will put it , I I  OK .  Yeah .  Where you lived between the ages of  Mm - hmm .  Which is more objective . than somebody evalu saying , I think I speak this or that .  Yeah , I was just gonna ask the same thing .  Region  Does that mean region of  Region of the US , or region of the world  OK .  Do you mean state , or do you mean more broad than the state level ?  You mean like you know southern US , or northeastern or  If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT .  They had divided things up into regions .  No , no .  It would only be f if you said American English  then you 'd put the regions .  For the others , you would just leave it .  Yeah .  We wouldn't have enough to really make them difference on those .  Oh , it 's like six regions of the country or something .  Very just a limited number  and then if you 're American you would just circle the region where  Yeah .  You 'd just leave them .  You don't even ask .  One one good reason to use the TIMIT ones is if anybody asks you you know , about the data later on you can say "" well I chose these based on TIMIT "" , And  And that would apply to everybody then ?  Yeah .  And then you could map those to the TIMIT regions later , if people wanted to .  Yeah .  That 's more general .  Yeah .  That 's true .  A lot of post - processing .  Yeah , y there is actu you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing , which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough ,  because somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base speaking English .  Yeah , so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of  Oh that 's nice , OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Sort of like as soon as you get to the cases on the edge , the complexity just shoots up .  Well , you know the other thing , too , is that it seems like th one of the reasons you would gather real detailed information about their native language is if you were gonna do fine - grained phonetic analysis or something .  and I don't  Well that 's what I was gonna ask ,  is that  Were they putting down where they lived at the moment they m recordings were made ?  Is that why ?  Rather than where they grew up ?  Mmm .  Yeah .  So , then we probably don't need the fine - grained information .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  It can't be relied on only .  Yeah , I think those are good .  Yeah .  I don't think you really have to do all that much .  Yeah .  N Right . Yeah .  N detec  And then there will be people who live in an English speaking country , but all their meetings are held in another language .  So ,  Yochai 's company is like that .  Everybody speaks Hebrew .  PIN .  what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this ?  ",,
Bmr008.E,"Will Will somebody go back and fill that in , or we just won't have it , or  Mmm .  So it wouldn't be that hard to go back and  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  What about that error that that uh the the supposed lub  no , the supposed bug that was that we were  We were guessing you had a bug before  because you went through and you concatenated all of these things together  Ah .  Are Are the things in the  So , uh , from from these charts , are  hmm , I 'm just trying to remember where we were ,  but uh , were you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between overlap and single speakers by looking at the e energy ,  like say , for example , the mean of the energy .  Was that the idea ?  OK .  So , if you look at on this page that has uh frame energy ,  you look at the mean for the overlap , that 's forty - four point sixty - two versus the mean for the speakers , thirty - nine point sixty - two ,  so there seems to be more energy when there 's overlapping which makes sense ,  but  Yeah ,  different than standard deviation .  Yeah .  so the um just one more clarifying question  On the overlap category , is that overlapping of speakers only ?  It doesn't include some of the other sounds ?  OK .  OK .  OK .  Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ?  What was the bug that you found ?  The bug from last uh meeting ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm !  So it was positioning randomly ?  ",,
Bmr008.F,"And there is a problem that you can hear it come and go ,  cuz when you turn your head , then you drift away from the microphone .  Yes .  That 's it .  Well and it 's also relevant to status .  I c I can insert that .  Which might in af affect the discourse aspects .  So , go ahead .  His  Uh - huh . Yeah .  Categories .  Oh I think undergrad is useful .  Yeah .  I think that  so Uh did are were you suggesting that it should be more fine grained than this ?  Less ?  What would you suggest as a as a change ?  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  I do , and the reason is because I think that um , well having been a grad student as , yeah , a as others here , at at Berkeley , that , um , I think there 's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad in terms of like the status .  I mean , I mean you notice it in various ways , like simply trying to meet with a professor during office hours .  You know , in in my department it was always the case grad students had a huge amount of different priority ,  and were treated as equals , g and and help helpers , you know , in in research , uh uh c uh roles and things that they that they  In terms of like the s the social dynamics of interactions , I would expect them to be less deferent .  and um maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that .  I don't think that we 're going to have a lot of undergrads ,  unless we branch out to different types of meetings , but  This is the dimension .  Well , this is the dimension .  Yeah , but One one dimension .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  And it 's non - threatening ,  I mean , this this compared to , you know , wh exactly what level of professorship , and and  Well , I agree with him , though .  I  Yeah .  But I I agree that this is that w the rea the motivation was things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research without being threatening to the person .  well , and we also discussed the idea of having the separate D T Ds would handle maybe , s specific meeting - specific things that might be relevant .  uh , the data , so that ,  you know , his XML thing ?  You got the Data Type Definition the Document Type Definition p part that it 's can s be used for relational things ,  yeah .  Where 'd This is just Well , you know , we 're we 're talking at at a general level of description .  You can always get more specific .  And , it may be  So , change Would we change "" Post - doc "" to "" Post - PHD Researcher "" ?  Mm - hmm .  That 's true .  It 's just to allow .  It could be st It could be That 's true .  Well , one thing , so you understand he he d he wants you to do this only once for each person ?  OK , OK .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well it  In in like the London - Lund they they the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw after the fact .  So they say , you know , uh middle thirties , you know fifties or sixties ,  and they and they just they estimate for the person But  Yeah .  And it isn't it isn't that boldf  Yeah .  And it 's and it isn't really that prominent .  It 's you know his "" Optional "" is not really boldface , but  Please , please !  Actually , "" approximate "" ?  That 's right .  Well , the thing abou the reason , uh , one reason for putting "" Optional "" might be if it uh , made the form seem gentler and k and not as intrusive kind of thing .  Yeah , I noticed , I was afraid you 'd I shouldn't say that .  They uh that , you know , i if you say "" Optional "" then it 's sort of  if people who get nervous about the age question then they realize that "" Oh well , but they 're not trying to ask me lots of things . ""  I like it .  I think it 's softening .  OK .  Let 's see .  That 's the only other one .  That 's the only one .  Well also , you you you he has a sep separate subject for Region .  and so it 's a self - assessment of what you think your closest variety is of English .  And then following that , a characterization of of region .  Now , we discussed maybe indicating a t a time frame .  So , "" Where did you live during your , you know , childhood and adolescence ? ""  which would be  Yes . Mm - hmm .  Although you know I mean a lot of people there won't be , e much difference ,  but  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  And that 's partly to pick up  Yeah .  S Mm - hmm  Well , we When we when we discussed it it was it was where where you lived during your childhood and adolescence .  Well It 's W it 's where you lived .  Mm - hmm .  Well , and also  Well  I haven't seen what what they did in TIMIT .  ",,
Bmr008.F,"Are you s Do they have a bunch of options like uh  I see .  OK .  Well , that 's the concept ,  yeah .  Well  That 's right .  Well that you know that was the concept of having the region thing ,  I It would be no problem to change it to options if um if that were desirable .  Although for different  Well , that 's true .  I mean , Indian English I wouldn't know f  what  That is kind of nice .  That was the concept of region .  and It 's just the wording of it .  I guess there 's a  There is another problem .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Or someone could in Geor - in in New York and have , I mean , any number of different types of speech patterns .  Well , we have this We hafta  So . He hasn't given you the overview ,  but you have , like , the Native Speaker category , the Non - native Speaker category ,  and then you have Other Language Influences , for example bilingual dialects , th things like that .  Now there 's this issue of not wa like you 're saying , you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the meeting to complete .  So , it 's trying to e there 's this trying to trying to hold this balance between the amount of information needed  and uh , you know , not taking too much meeting time ,  and then in addition , add to it the third level of the balance , uh , um this this issue of not being too intrusive , asking in a way that they don't mind .  Well , I think rea I think that we need to remember that we have First of all , it 's not all free form .  We have several categories that are specifically constrained ,  And in terms of the more open ones , we have the we 're in the enviable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people who will be participating in the meeting data .  We can find it We can resolve certain issues later , if  Mm - hmm .  That 's it .  Well - Isn't it I mean , I think that we 're going a little bit in a circle , because I like the TIMIT suggestion very much ,  and I think it 's a question of how to ge incorporate it ,  and and we 've already suggested I mean , it 's come up in this discussion , that the suggestion that we could have um the TIMIT categories for the American ,  and and then make the choice or not , as to whether we do it for British ,  I mean , w we sort of discussed one way or the other ,  and it doesn't matter to me .  I don't know if Adam has has a preference ,  but we could have you know , a sub a sub - categorization for American ,  We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization .  I don't know if it has one for British , or whatever ,  But you know , just have it you know , a short simple form that you can categorize yourself in a in a systematic way .  It 's a good idea .  And the peers .  That 's one part though .  Well , It 's that 's not a problem though ,  I mean . That would be a good question to ask ,  and then you could add a question .  You know , would uh "" among your peers "" .  You know .  Specify the age range .  Yeah , that 's right .  and we 're  and then we like I said , we have the enviable benefit of knowing most of these people .  and being able to ask them follow - ups if we need to .  For now .  That 's true .  Washington and stuff , yeah .  That 's true .  Well , it 's  Well , I you know , I w I was thinking of it as e  that 's a good point ,  but I was thinking uh , you know , with reference to the language model issue , which uh  and I guess it could be done inductively ,  but if you have a bunch of , say , R - less dialects and uh you know , if they  Mm - hmm .  Interesting .  Mm - hmm .  But you have a lot of stratification in any region .  Interesting .  Mm - hmm .  Well  Mm - hmm .  Well that 's what the final the fin the third category was designed to do ,  because I mean , you have a bunch of different types of accents in New York  You know .  Native - speaking New Yorkers , as a as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their You know .  There are lots of things that are very identifiable as um you know , other other aspects , which is why we have this third category .  So we wanted to certainly distinguish American versus British , and other types at that level ,  and then allow people to self - identify if there are other specific things ,  and then in addition , this issue of regions with some sort of time frame for the re region because I think that if you live in Massachusetts now versus you know , in childhood and as adolescence  So if you lis if if you  You know .  So , region with respect to a time frame is what I would suggest .  "" Where did you live ? ""  I mean . What you said .  you know , "" where where wh where did you live ? "" ,  ",,
Bmr008.F,"or uh , what you were saying , "" Languages in the home "" .  But I think that uh a time frame on the region would be useful  instead of "" Region now "" , say . It 's a little bit unbounded .  well , you know , there 's this issue of of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns , whatever they are .  And Oh , that 's interesting .  Oh that 's interesting .  from five to fifteen or something , is a  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well I I g  OK .  I don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now ,  because  It 's It 's a sub - categorization .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  That 's to handle that unusual percent or two .  Yeah .  It 's very efficient .  Well , you  Mm - hmm .  Well , y you didn't really talk about the non - English speaker categories .  Because it used to be that Germans would learn British English , and now I think there 's , you know , is a certain percentage of them who who 've @ @ to tend toward American English .  That 's hard though , for self - identification  I agree .  Well , e I 'd  I 'd have to I I 'd wanna relate it back to training .  "" How many years did you study English "" ,  or , you know , "" have you lived in the America in a c an English country before "" .  But it seems like that 's so  I mean , I think that you know , if a person who  That 'd be OK .  Yeah , I like that .  I like that .  That 's that 's non - threatening , and it 's also an i a good indicator .  And there are people who haven't ever lived in an English speaking country and who are superb .  However , um , that 's you know I do think it 's a pretty good indicator .  That 's true too .  Or even , you know , I mean , some people who just don't change much in their  Except that you have some many biasing factors ,  you have you have people who are highly confident when they really should be a little bit less confident ,  and then you have , uh other people who are just the reverse , and and it  so many things that vary I  And also we wanna keep it simple and non - evaluative .  Why do we need that much information ,  why do we need the email address , for example ?  Oh , I see .  How often would that happen ?  I see .  So the only so  Well , it 's an it 's an interesting identifier , I I now that I realize the und the reason for it .  The That 's true too .  Yeah .  That 's interesting .  Good idea .  It 's the age question again .  Yeah , that 's right .  And a bank where you frequent .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I like that .  I never thought of that as an identifier .  That makes sense .  Yeah .  Well , that I think , someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact .  And this would and and we discussed this ,  this is with reference to like the DTD ,  what you would put in the DTD that 's meeting - specific .  So . And it could be something like , "" oh by the way , the guy giving the presentation today is the student of the professor who you know ,  whatever "" .  So , speaker A is his professor and they and he 's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that .  Or it could be you know , "" so - and - so and so - and - so are married "" .  We this wouldn't be relevant all the time  but you know , if there 's a big discussion on you know , the the um , best way to move house , then and these people are talking a whole lot , then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they 're married , or  I I don't mean , uh , you know .  I would tend to leave that e spontaneous ,  I think that e at the stage of uh Uh , sc scanning the transcripts after they 've been produced by by our by IBM , At that point , I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important ,  and you could you could spend a lot of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I ju I was just thinking , with reference to uh , things that have that bear on the content or the status relations , would be the things  Without being exhaustive , by any means ,  but just like I said , if there 's a k a certain topic that comes up in the meeting , and that knowing their relationship will clarify it , or if there 's a certain dynamic that comes up  So , I mean , a person is asked a whole bunch of questions , more than you 'd usually think they 'd be asked ,  and it turns out it 's because he 's being prepared for a job interview or something like that , then it 's useful to know that that relationship .  But , not to be exhaustive .  Interesting .  Oh , well yeah , you could have people who are all part of the same football league , or uh or chess club , or  Mm - hmm .  ",,
Bmr008.F,"Well , realize , w this was the idea was that this would be meeting specific .  Otherwise , they would it would be possible to have a higher level thing .  That 's true . That 's true .  Well , the there 's @ @ I mean .  I g you You 're the expert on the D T  but  Yeah .  Well  And so , you know , in discourse analysis you get things like @ @ the role .  You have you have a role in relationships and it has to do with your negotiating your how you 're perceived and how y and how the other @ @  You know , and so there are various things you negotiate .  And I 'm I 'm wondering if we might be able to do it s in sort of a loose way , but e with by having a searchable field like "" role ""  and then you know "" within this context this person has the following roles "" , and it could be very loose ,  but then it would be possible to do something as simple as a grep across a database  and if you 're interested in you know which which which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus you know a l uh s uh whatever , a leader , speaker , whatever , you could just grep for "" role "" and and you know , some some particular value .  And  Interesting . Good .  And systematize also maybe the encoding of it if as we find some are useful and some are not so useful .  I think you don't need to have that much structure built in , and that would be less time - consuming to do it this way first , and then find out what structure 's needed .  Mm - hmm .  Oh .  What about doing it with just the single channels ?  What about ,  uh  Well , I I 'm thinking so they 're raising the question about the fact that if you use the mixed signal , there 's already been a  I I 'm wo  Exactly .  So what I 'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the single channel recordings .  Interesting .  That 'll also lessen the standard deviation .  Pitch .  I 'm wondering about um if there  I suppose this is still just that one that one data sample ,  right ,  that one meeting ?  But it seems like to have it it seems like a very hard test to have it be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined rather than taking s you know , maybe two extreme speakers out of the mix and seeing if if it 's promising with respect to that type of analysis .  If you take like a target speaker , and maybe  well , I mean , if there 's enough data , maybe two  two target speakers  and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers .  That 's hard .  OK .  That 's true .  That 's complicated .  Ah , that 's interesting ,  and it didn't give you good error messages .  Huh .  Oh , digits .  OK .  ",,
Bmr009.A,"We 're we 're live by the way , so we 've got a good intro here  Yep .  We can edit that out if you want .  OK .  So . This time the form discussion should be very short ,  right ?  OK .

And so even if if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap .  No prayer .  That was a great overlap by the way .

I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News .  That might be good enough .  Yeah .  It 'd be worth a try .  It would be interesting to see what we get .  Yep .  Yep , if IBM doesn't  Yeah Right .  Forms Next iteration of forms .  Oops .  Nope .  One 's a digit form ,  one 's a speaker form .  So one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits .  So don't fill these out .  This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like .  So , they incorporate the changes that we talked about .  On which one ?  Oh you mean on the digit form ?  Uh , because the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest .  So it was intentional .  It 's an interesting observation ,  but it was intentional .  Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and ,  excuse me ,  the time is when you actually read the digits , but I 'm filling out the date beforehand .  If you look at the form in front of you ? that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ? you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time .  Yeah , I 've noticed that in the forms .  The the reason I put the time in , is so that the person who 's extracting the digits , meaning me , will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find the digits .  I know .  And I haven't said anything .  Yep .  No , it 's about fifty fifty .  Actually it 's about one third each .  About one third of them are blank ,  about one third of them are when the digits are read ,  and about one third of them are when the meeting starts .  So .  I could put instructions ?  Nah .  But if I 'm not at the meeting , I can't do that .  Yep , but that is the reason Name , Email and Time are where they are .  And then the others are later on .  Mm - hmm .  What ?  What which form are you talking about ?  Oh you 're talking about the digit form .  The digit form doesn't The digit  No , that 's alright .  The digit form doesn't have a "" for official use only "" line .  It just has a line , which is what you 're supposed to read .  So on the digits form , everything above the line is a fill - in form  and everything below the line is digits that the user reads .  No , either way is fine  I just You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to .  Right .  Yep .  Just as uh as I have for all the others .  That 's because the one , the digit form that has native language is the old form  not the new form .  Yeah this was the problem with these categories ,  I I picked those categories from TIMIT .  ","And I was just going to say that that right now we 're just exploring .  What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system .  And so even if if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap .  Yeah this was the problem with these categories ,  I I picked those categories from TIMIT .  ","Participants also reviewed the latest iteration of speaker forms, and discussed recent changes to the Transcriber tool. "
Bmr009.A,"I don't know what those are .  With TIMIT ,  yeah ?  So , I was gonna ask  wh w I mean .  So so what accent are we speaking ?  Western ?  Yeah , I mean you could call it whatever you want .  For the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one .  So I just left it blank and you can put whatever you want .  Sure .  So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety .  You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , "" You know , these are great if you 're a linguist "" .  But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them .  Yeah  So I guess my only question was if if you were a South Midland speaking region , person ? Would you know it ?  Is that what you would call yourself ?  Yeah .  Well , We I think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form .  I think that 's alright if we want to follow up .  But .  Yeah , so I picked these regions cuz we had talked about TIMIT ,  and those are right from TIMIT .  So .  Yeah , I certainly don't .  I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak .  Am I speaking Am I speaking Western ?  Northwest ?  Yeah , so this is a real problem .  I don't know what to do about it .  I c  I think at the first level , for example , we speak the same .  our our dialects Or whatever you region are the same .  But I don't know what it is .  So .  a techno - speak accent ?  A a geek region ?  No problem .  There are hardly any subjects from "" beep ""  Yeah really .  Well well we sort of  Well , I like the idea of asking "" what variety of English do you speak "" as opposed to where you 're from  Because th if we start asking where we 're from , again you have to start saying , "" well , is that the language you speak or is that just where you 're from ? ""  And  I mean . So so I would say Germany  You know am I speaking with German accent  I don't think so .  Oh , OK yeah .  Yep .  Yeah , I guess I could try to put squeeze in a little map .  I mean there 's not a lot of r of room  I think of those , Northern is the only one that I don't even know what they 're meaning .  Ye  I don't think the Northwest people speak any differently than I do .  That that 's  exactly what we 're arguing about .  We don't know .  I mean some of them are very obvious .  If you if you talk to someone speaking with Southern drawl , you know .  Or Boston , yeah .  But is Boston New England ?  W I guess that 's the problem with these categories .  OK , so . I propose , take out Northern add , don't know .  So you want to change the instructions also not just say region ?  I don't know  if I if I read this form , I think they 're going to ask it they 're going to answer the same way if you say , "" What 's variety of English do you speak ?  Region . ""  as if you say "" what variety of region region do you speak ?  Please characterize your accent ? ""  They 're going to answer the same way .  Oh , I see .  Well what we talked about with that is is so that they would understand the granularity .  I mean that 's what I had before , and you told me to list the regions to list them .  So .  I mean I had it wide open last week and and you said TIMIT .  That 's what the "" Other "" is for .  Won't they answer the same thing ?  Right .  I mean that 's why I put the "" Other "" in .  Yep .  So I mean , I I mean the way I had it last time was Region was blank ,  it just said Region colon .  And and I think that that 's the best way to do it ,  because because of the problems we 're talking about  but what we said last week , was no , put in a list ,  so I put in a list .  So should we go back to  Well , certainly dropping "" Northern "" I think is right , because none of us know what that is .  Is "" Midwest "" one word ?  And uh  But that 's true of New England too .  So . I mean only one  Well , I shouldn't say that .  I have no clue .  I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City .  But I have no idea whether it does or not .  I think that that was what happened with TIMIT , was that it was an analyst .  New England  Oh , no .  "" Other "" ,  it goes under "" Other "" ,  definitely under "" Other "" .  OK . So .  Another suggestion .  Rather than have circle fill in forms , say "" Region , open paren , E G Southern comma Western comma close paren colon . ""  Actually , maybe we do one non - English one as well .  Southern , Cockney ?  Is that a real accent ?  How do you spell it ?  N E  ",So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety .  But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them .  ,
Bmr009.A,"OK , we 'll do it that way .  Actually , I like that a lot .  Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do ,  the granularity , and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  Yep , just which one .  I think that 's fine .  Yep .  Um , did you guys get my email on the multitrans ?  That  OK .  Yeah . So . So . I I have a version also which actually displays all the channels .  But it 's hideously slow .  The what the ones I applied , that you can actually do are Dan 's , because it doesn't slow it down .  Just uses a lot of memory .  No , the the one that 's installed is fine .  It 's not slow at all .  I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes with the views .  But the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls .  It 's really bad .  Mm - hmm .  As you play , as you move , as you scroll .  Just about anything , and it it was so slow it was not usable .  So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it .  So . I think that the one Dan has is usable enough .  It doesn't display the others .  It displays just the mixed signal .  But you can listen to any of them .  No , he suggested that , but he didn't It 's not installed .  No . No .  Um , not if we 're going to use Tcl - TK At least not if we 're going to use Snack .  I mean you would have to do something ourselves .  Why don't we we see how Dan 's works and if it If we really need the display  I mean .  We we could do that but that would mean changing the code .  I mean this isn't a program we wrote .  This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on .  So .  Yeah .  Not easily .  I mean y yes we could do that .  You could you can write widgets in C .  And try to do it that way but I just don't think it  Let 's try it with Dan 's and if that isn't enough , we can do it otherwise .  I think it is , cuz when I was playing with it , the mixed signal has it all in there .  And so it 's really It 's not too bad to find places in the in the stream where things are happening .  So I I don't think it 'll be bad .  And if if  Depends on how much work they did .  I think if if if one of us sat down and coded it , so that it could be displayed fast enough I 'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it .  But it 's not a trivial task .  Yeah .  anyway , shall we do digits ?  OK .  OK .  Well , you want to go first ? Or .  Do you wanna go do digits or do you wanna just skip digits ?  Then Alright . You go ahead .  Why don't you read the digits ?  Yeah , don't Don't read the old one .  OK  And  ","Um , did you guys get my email on the multitrans ?  Yeah . So . So .

I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic .

I was suggesting not having the options ,  just having them  Yes , but if , as Liz is suggesting , people who have strong accents know that they do  and are  Well , I know .  That 's true .  Yeah .  Yeah that 's fine .  They might say "" Other "" for Region because they don't know what category to use  but they might have something  because it is easier to have it open ended .  Well , we thought about it .  Yeah , OK .  We just We sort of thought , "" yes , "" y y I mean  At the last meeting , my recollection was that we felt people would have uh less  that that there are so many types and varieties of these other languages  and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups  and that it 's a huge waste of of space .  That 's what I thought .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I don't think that 's what they mean .  It does seem  I mean . I I would think that these categories would be more w would be easier for an an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself .  OK .  OK .  I sort of thought they were part of the one of the Midlands .  Yeah .  OK .  Fine by me , fine by me .  Yeah .  Be easier on the subjects .  I think that 's fine .  No .  I think  I like that .

Now I have one suggestion on the next section .  So you have native language ,  you have region ,  and then you have time spent in English speaking country .  Now , I wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying "" which one parenthesis S paren closed parenthesis "" .  Cuz if they spent time in in Britain and America  It doesn't have to be ex all at all exact , just in the same open field format that you have .  Mm - hmm .  with a with an S  "" which one  sss , optional S .  Yeah .  Yeah , that 's good .  Isn't that wonderful !  Yeah .  Excellent !  Thank you !  So you this is n Dan 's patches , Dan Ellis 's patches .  Fantastic !  Mm - hmm .  That 's a consideration .  And this 'll be a hav having the multiwave will be a big help  cuz in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things , that 'll be a big help .  Mm - hmm .  That 's excellent .  He also has version control which is another nice  e so you e the patches that you  Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches .  Oh OK .  Well . Alright .  Well , or use the one that crawls .  Mm - hmm .  And it 's also also the case that that uh this multi - wave thing is proposed to the  So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people ,  and it 's likely that uh  So . And and they responded favorably  looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version .  They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before was simply that they hadn't had time to do it .

Bmr009.C,"Starts  No .  No .  There 's another  I don't know .  It starts with a P or something .  I forget the word for it , but it 's it 's um  Typically when you you 're ab r starting around forty for most people ,  it starts to harden and then it 's just harder for the lens to shift things  and th the the symptom is typically that you you have to hold stuff uh uh further away to to see it .  In fact , uh m my brother 's a gerontological psychologist  and he he uh came up with an an uh a uh body age test which uh gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st statistical predictors of all the rest of it .  And one of them is is the distance that you have to hold it at .  Yeah .  Oh . Yeah .  About how old I am .  OK .  No , that 's OK .  It also should be later .  Because Jane uh is not here yet .  And uh she 'll be most interested in that .  Uh , she 's probably least involved in the signal - processing stuff  so maybe we can just just uh ,  I don't think we should go though an elaborate thing ,  but um uh Jose and I were just talking about the uh uh , speech e energy thing ,  and I uh  We didn't talk about the derivatives .  But I think , you know , the the i  if I can if you don't mind my my speaking for you for a bit , um Uh .  Right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction , but uh  but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at .  Um . And uh one is that uh this is all in log energy  and log energy is basically compressing the distances uh between things .  Um Another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal sizes .  He was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds  uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before .  Um And uh and the other thing is that the yeah doing the subtracting off the mean and the variance in the uh and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain , may not be the right thing to do .  Uh B Between between  No .  Between  Neither .  It 's uh between the pauses uh for some segment .  And so i i his his He 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds .  And so you take that .  And then he 's he 's uh measuring at the frame level  still at the frame level , of what  and then and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount .  um and But one thing he was pointing out is when he he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain , it is actually pretty hard to see the change .  And you can sort of see that , because of j of just putting it on the board that if you sort of have log - X plus log - X , that 's the log of X plus the log of two  and it 's just , you know , it it diminishes the effect of having two of them .  Um .  Yes , right .  So So what I was suggesting to him is that  Actually , a PDF .  But , you know , uh But , either way .  Yeah .  Yeah , eith eith uh B  Yeah , but I think also u I think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at examples of the data and can not see a change in how big the the signal is , when the two speaker  Then , that 's a problem right there .  So . I think you should at least be able ,  doing casual looking and can get the sense , "" Hey , there 's something there . ""  and then you can play around with the measures .  And when he 's looking in the log domain he 's not really seeing it .  So .  And when he 's looking in straight energy he is ,  so that 's a good place to start .  Um . So that was that was the discussion we just had .  Um . The other thing  Actually we ca had a question for Adam in this .  Uh , when you did the sampling ? uh over the speech segments or s or sampling over the the individual channels in order to do the e uh the amplitude equalization , did you do it over just the entire everything in the mike channels ?  You didn't try to find speech ?  Right , OK .  So then that means that someone who didn't speak very much would be largely represented by silence .  And someone who would who would be  So the normalization factor probably is i i i is is  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But that 's  Right .  So th  OK .  So yeah there there there There 's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts that there is there there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm normalization with some sort  if if we can figure out a way to do it .  Uh . But we were agreed that in addition to that uh there should be s stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth .

","The Berkely Meeting Recorder group discussed efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap in which the time window analyzed was 200 milliseconds or greater. Preliminary results were presented showing that log domain analyses did not reveal a significant difference in mean energy levels for windows of overlapping versus non-overlapping speech.

You have some histograms ,  um and uh , they don't look very separate .  uh separated .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  "" Number ""  Yeah .  But And so in in these he 's got that .  He 's got some pictures .  But he doesn't he doesn't in the he i  just in derivatives , but not in the  but he d but he doesn't doesn't  But he didn't h have it for the energy .  He had it for the derivatives .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh that yeah that 's a good q  did did you have this sort of thing , for just the just the l r uh the the unnormalized log energy ?  OK . Yeah .  So she she 's right .  That 's a  Yeah .  That 's That 's uh cuz I 'd mentioned scatter plots before but she 's right ,  I mean , even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at a single feature uh , looking at the distribution , is a good thing to do .  Yeah , but but what she 's saying is , which is right , is le  I mean , let 's start with the  Before we get complicated , let 's start with the most basic wh thing , which is we 're arguing that if you take energy uh if you look at the energy , that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually there 'll be more energy than when one is  right ?  That 's that sort of hypothesis .  And the first way you 'd look at that , uh s she 's , you know , absolutely right ,  is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things ,  much as you 've plotted them here ,  You know , but just but just just uh do it  Well in this case you have three .  You have the silence , and that that 's fine .  So , uh with three colors or three shades or whatever ,  just just look at those distributions .  And then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved , you know , or or or worsened by the looking at regular energy , looking at log energy ,  we were just proposing that maybe it 's you know , it 's harder to see with the log energy ,  um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ?  But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots  because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions .  Let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature .  I think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated .  Um And then we w I think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate to help .  Um But since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , when two people were talking , that 's eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition .  And she 's right , that a that having a having having this table , with a whole bunch of things , with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's it 's it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the the same kind of picture you have here .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . So there 'll be some cases for which  But , the qu So So they 'll be  This is I w want to point to visual things ,  But I mean they there 'll be time There 'll be overlap between the distributions ,  but the question is , "" If it 's a reasonable feature at all , there 's some separation . ""  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right . I mean the the reason I had suggested the scatter f p features is I used to do this a lot , when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at .  um Because something is a good feature uh by itself , you don't really know how it 'll behave in combination  and so it 's nice to have as many as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form .  There 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny funny way .  But it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have have some uh some hope  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , no we don't have that .  But .  Yeah .  Well I I I I would s actually still recommend that he do the overall thing  because it would be the quickest thing for him to do .  He could You see , he already has all his stuff in place ,  he has the histogram mechanism ,  he has the stuff that subtracts out  and all he has to do is change it uh uh from from log to plain energy and plot the histogram and look at it .

Bmr009.C,"And then he should go on and do the other stuff bec  but But this will  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But I guess I was just saying that that right now uh from the means that you gave , I don't have any sense of whether even , you know , there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct  and I would imagine there should be some you know , there should be The distributions should be somewhat separated .  Uh and I I would still guess that if they are not separated at all , that there 's some there 's there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it .  Um , but um For instance , I mean I wouldn't expect that it was very common overall , that when two people were talking at the same time , that it would that it really was lower ,  although sometimes , as you say , it would .  So . So .  Yeah .  I mean .  No .  It could it probably does happen sometimes .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  e e and and again what they what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log ,  so ,  as well .  Mmm , no ,  if it 's if i if it 's  Well , it won't be as big .  If if you 're a I guess my point is , if you 're doing essentially a linear separation , taking the log first does in fact make it harder to separate .  So it 's So , uh if you i i So i if there if there close to things it does  it 's a nonlinear operation that does in fact change the distinction .  If you 're doing a non if you 're doing some fancy thing then then  yeah .  And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and and saying we 're going to cut it here .  Um and that that 's the indicator that we 're getting .  But anyway , yeah , we 're not disagreeing on any of this ,  we should look at it more uh more finely , but uh uh I think that This often happens , you do fairly complicated things , and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple .  So uh , if you generated something like that just for the energy and see , and then , a a a as as Liz says , when they g have uh uh smaller um , more coherent groups to look at , that would be another interesting thing later .

Harmonicity and so on ?  Preparing to  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh , that 's not what I meant .  No , no .  I I I I  Well , we certainly should see this but I I I I think that the harm  I certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things  I was just saying  Yeah .  Yeah , I was just saying  OK .  OK . OK .  But I think , like , all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things ,  I think I would just sort of look at the energy and then get into the harmonicity as as a suggestion .  Uh OK .  So maybe uh since w we 're trying to uh compress the meeting ,  um , I know Adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about  and did you have some ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  You you want it around the overlapping part .  You want it to include something that 's not in overlapping  but but uh  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I 'm not sure that 's necessarily true .  Because because it because um again if you 're just compensating for the gain ,  you know , the fact that this this gain thing was crude ,  and the gain wh if someone is speaking relatively at consistent level , just to to give a an extreme example , all you 're doing is compensating for that .  And then you still s And then if you look at the frame with respect to that , it still should should uh change  Mm - hmm .  Right .  This was sort of where where we were last week .

Well again for the close mike stuff , we could come up take a s take the Switchboard system or something ,  and Um  Just , you know , low - pass filter the speech and  Yeah .

Bmr009.D,"No .  That 's a different thing .  Oh .  Oh .  Give someone a piece of paper and then they Oh .  Oh , that 's optional .  You know .  Are these the long term means ?  Like , over the whole  I mean , the means of what ?  All the frames in the conversation ?  Or of things that  Oh .  Oh .  Right .  Yeah , maybe it 's not log distributed .  But you could do like a C D F there instead ?  I mean , we don't know that the distribution here is normally .  So just some kind of a simple  PDF  Yeah .  Something like that where it 's sort of data driven .  Oh yeah .  Oh yeah .  What  Log energy .  Sorry .  Frame energy .  Yeah .  Yeah .  W I mean , what I meant is , even if you use linear , you know , raw measures , like raw energy or whatever ,  maybe we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution 's shape ,  and just use you know , use the distribution to model the the mean ,  or what y you know , rather than the mean take some  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh .  Right . So , we don't know what they look like on the , tsk For the raw .  Yeah .  So .  I mean , there might be something there .  I don't know .  Huh .  Well it might be just good to know what it looks like .  Cuz  Yeah .  Right .  Especially locally .  So . Locally .  And the other thing is I  Sorry .  I  Well , especially for normalizing .  I mean , it 's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .  And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same .  e Actually , I was wondering , right now you 're taking a all of the speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap ,  but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker ,  right ?  So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and then just their overlaps ,  like but by hand ,  by cheating ,  and looking at you know , if you can detect something that way ,  because if we can't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it .  That You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone .  Plus , I think it has more elegant e  The m the right model will be easier to see that way .  So if I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech  and just sort of look at those three cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps ,  maybe  and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern  but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of of people that can overlap .  So .  Just seems sort of complex .  Right .  Cuz if energy doesn't matter there , like  I don't think this is true , but what if  Hmm ?  Well , to study the simplest case to get rid of extra  Right .  Cuz what if it 's the case and I don't think this is true  What if it 's the case that when two people overlap they equate their you know , there 's a conservation of energy and everybody  both people talk more softly ?  I don't think this happens at all .  Or they get louder .  Yeah or  I mean .  There are there are different types ,  and within those types ,  like as Jose was saying , that sounded like a backchannel overlap ,  meaning the kind that 's a friendly encouragement , like "" Mm - hmm . "" ,  "" Great ! "" ,  "" Yeah ! ""  And it doesn't take you don't take the floor .  Um , but , some of those , as you showed , I think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap .  So .  It Actually the s new student , Don , who um Adam has met , and he was at one of our meetings  He 's getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again in mid - January .  He 's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap .  I don't know if he 's talked with you yet .  But in sort of honing in on these different types  and So maybe  So it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then , you know , look at that .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , no . I didn't mean that that for you to do that ,  but I was thinking if if Don and I are trying to get categories  and we label some data for you , and we say this is what we think is going  So you don't have to worry about it .  And here 's the three types of overlaps .  And we 'll we 'll do the labelling for you .  Um .  Yeah , that we would be working on anyway .  Then maybe you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , no , that was That was a jok  ",Are these the long term means ?  ,
Bmr009.D,"or a sort of , a case where where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals .  So .  It might the case , though , that the significant energy , just as Jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases .  Because in back Most people when they 're talking don't change their own energy when they get a backchannel ,  cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel .  And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an "" mm - hmm "" .  And the "" mm - hmm "" is really usually very low energy .  So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy .  But all the other cases might .  and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot s in terms of their words or  I mean , just listen to it .  So .  Well , it would be lost no matter what you do .  It just  I mean , even if you take the log , you can your model just has a more sensitive measures .  So .  Yeah .  Right . Right .  Yeah .  Oh .  That 'd be great .  Yeah , I remem  Right .  That would be great .  That would be really great .  We have nothing  You know , basically , we got his environment set up .  He 's he 's a double - E you know .  So . It 's mostly that , if we had to label it ourselves , we we would or we 'd have to , to get started ,  but if It it would be much better if you can do it .  You 'd be much better at doing it also  because you know , I I 'm not I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out ,  and I really didn't wanna go into that if I didn't have to .  So if If you 're w willing to do that or or  Yeah .  I think that 's a research effort in and of itself ,  because you can read the literature , but I don't know how it 'll turn out  and , You know , it 's always an interesting question .  That 'd be great .  That 'd be really great .  And we 'd still have some funding for this project ,  like probably , if we had to hire some like an undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half time on something else  I mean , he we 're not paying him the full RA - ship for all the time .  So . um If we got it to where we wanted we needed someone to do that  I don't think there 's really enough data where where  Yeah .  But  Yeah , definitely .  Yeah , that 's true .  The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel .  Yeah .  Well it 's a sliding window ,  right ?  So if you take the the measure in the center of the overlapped piece , you know , there 'd better be some something .  But if your window is really huge then yeah you 're right  you won't even  The portion of the of the backchannel won't won't effect anything .  But you  Yeah .  So .  You know , you shouldn't be more than  like You should definitely not be three times as big as your as your backchannel .  Then you 're gonna w have a wash .  And hopefully it 's more like on the order of  Yea  Yeah , it depends how different your normalization is , as you slide your window across .  I mean . That 's something we don't know .  Yeah I was talking about the n normalization window .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's true . Yeah .  Um .  But that 'd be great if if you 're marking those  and um .  But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks ,  and I was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , this student and I would be looking at the time marks  and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels Jane gave  I don't think you need to .  Yeah . That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow ,  right ?  Not now .  Well , it 's something that w  Well , we we wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway ,  so somehow if once he gets going we 're gonna hafta come up with one  and  Yeah .  So whatever you would label would be attached to the words , I think .  Cuz there 's there 's a lot of work you can't do without that ,  I mean , how how would you  You 'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word  is y if you 're interested in anything to do with words .

Well , I 'll talk to you about it and we can see  but it 's definitely great to have the other one .  That 's  Right .  OK .  Oh .  So . You mean they could they could do it and it would be fast enough if they do it ?  Or ?  Mm - hmm .  OK .  OK .  I actually have to leave .  So . Um . I mean I had to leave at three thirty ,  so I can Well , I can wait for the digits but I can't stay for the discussion  I c I have to make a call .  So .  Um .  No , I can do digits if if But I don't wanna butt in , or something .  But if there 's something on the rest of the  I 'm I 'll be around just have to make call before quarter of .  So .  So I  Or we can talk about it .  OK . Alright .  Oh , this is the new one .  Alright .  The And the time is .  OK .  ",So is there any hope for actually displaying the wave form ?  ,

And did you , uh , forward Morgan Brian 's thing ?  Oh , you did ?  OK . So you probably did get that .  Yeah .  Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunteer ,  and since he 's not here , I 'll repeat it  to at least modify Transcriber ,  which , if we don't have something else that works , I think that 's a pretty good way of going .  And we discussed on some methods to do it .  My approach originally ,  and I 've already hacked on it a little bit  it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms .  But he pointed out that you don't really have to .  I think that 's a good point .  That if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient .  No . They can only display one ,  but they can listen to different ones .  But only to listen to ,  not to look at .  The waveform you 're looking at doesn't change .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Oh , we should definitely get with them then ,  and  agree upon a format .  Though I don't remember email on that .  So was I not in the loop on that ?  Oh , OK .  Yeah , I think that 's right .

Yeah , although the the  using the close - talking I think would be much better .  Wouldn't it ?  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  And I hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred .  Yeah . Who knows ?  Well , u uh , IBM was going to .  Um  and I imagine they still plan to  but but , you know , I haven't spoken with them about that recently .  OK . I 'll do that .  Yep .  Right .  Is he on the mailing list ?  The Meeting Recorder mailing li ?  We should add him .  Add him .  Um ,  so one thing is that I did look on Sony 's for a replacement for the mikes for the head m head - worn ones  cuz they 're so uncomfortable .  But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than I do ,  because I couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector ,  which seems really unlikely to me .  Does anyone , like , know stores  or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask ?  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  When I looked , i they listed one microphone and that 's it  as having that type of connector .  But my guess is that Sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does .  And and so  it seems it seems really unlikely to me that there 's only one .  As I said , who knows ?  Um ,  I have it downstairs .  I don't remember off the top of my head .  And then , uh  just in terms of how you wear them  I mean , I had thought about this before .  I mean , when when when you use a product like DragonDictate , they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on .  But I felt that in a real situation we were very seldom gonna get people to really do it  and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on .  But  Mm - hmm .  Oh . That 's true .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Well , I 'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste s see if they still have the little form .  Well , that 's the  It seemed to me when I was using Dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an in , uh an enormous amount .

","The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group talked about the ongoing transcription effort and issues related to the Transcriber tool, which despite its limitations for capturing tight time markings for overlapping speech, will continue to remain in use. Recording equipment and procedures were discussed, with a focus on audible breathing and the need for standards in microphone wear and use. "
Bmr010.A,"Everyone 's adjusting their microphones , of course .  And then just close enough so that you get good volume .  So you know , wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it .  Yeah .  I mean , when when it 's on , you can see it .  You can definitely see it .  Absolutely .  Absolutely .  And so , you know , I 've I 've sat here and watched sometimes the breathing ,  and the bar going up and down ,  and I 'm thinking , I could say something ,  but  I don't want to make people self - conscious .  Stop breathing !  Right .  Yep .  And then also the position of the mike also .  If it 's more directly , you 'll get better volume .  So so , like , yours is pretty far down below your mouth . Yeah .  I don't know why that is .  I 've been eating a lot .  So ,  mark them ?  Oh , great .  Against they could do forced alignment .  Oh , I didn't know that .  That would be a really interesting prosodic feature ,  when  Right .  So are do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically , or as word models , or what ?  Mm - hmm .  Mouth stuff ?  How would we do that with the hybrid system ?  So train a phone in the neural net ?  Oh , it does ?  Right . So in the hybrid system we could train the net with a laughter phone and a breath sound phone .  Do whatever you want .  To go on forever ?  And how do you handle it in the language model ?  It 's just a word in the language model .  Cool .  Huh .  OK .  Can you hand me your digit form ?  I just wanna mark that you did not read digits .  I was noticing that with Dan in the one that we , uh we hand tran hand - segmented ,  that th he has these little chuckles as he talks .  Speech researchers ?  Cuz they 're gonna be transcribing it in a few days .  That 's a good idea .  Good .  Oh , no .  Is that good or bad ?  Yeah .  You 'll self - repair .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Where were they when we needed them ?  I mean , this was something that we were talking about .  We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times .  Right ?  One for each participant .  So they could by hand  Yeah .  Yeah .  Is you mean two thousand one ?  Calendar year  or ?  OK .  Full - time .  Yeah .  Wow .  I don't see how someone could do forty hours a week on transcription .  I think it would be  We 'd have to mark them .  I think it would also be interesting to have , uh , a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do ,  cuz I 'm curious about inter - annotator agreement .  Wrong .  I think it just whoever is interested can do that .  I mean , so if someone wants to use that data  We could skip the digits .  We don't have to read digits each time .  OK .  With what ?  Scale .  Mm - hmm .  I think with  That 's right . But I think Javier 's  I think Javier 's might be able to .  It doesn't have the same Gaus - uh , H M M modeling ,  which is I think a drawback .  But , uh  Does it ?  Yeah .  And then he ch you choose optimal splitting .  Maybe I 'm misremembering , but I did not think it had a Markov  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I didn't think so .  Yep .  And so I I think it would work fine for detecting overlap .  It 's just , uh , that i it  he has the two - pass issue that  What he does is , as a first pass he he p he does , um , a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates .  And that 's just a data reduction step ,  so that you 're not trying at every time interval .  And so those are the putative places where he tries .  And right now he 's doing that with silence  and that doesn't work  with the Meeting Recorder .  So if we used another method to get the first pass , I think it would probably work .  It 's a good method .  As long as the len as long the segments are long enough .  That 's the other problem .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  You mean Javier 's ?  What do you mean ?  I  Yeah . I had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample ,  and it worked pretty well ,  but I haven't worked with it a lot .  So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample  and I added ten times the amount of numbers at random ,  and it did pick out pretty good boundaries .  But this was just very anecdotal sort of thing .  Right . So if we if we fed the hand - segmentation to Javier 's and it doesn't work , then we know something 's wrong .  Yeah . I think that 's probably worthwhile doing .  Whether it 'll work or not .  Yeah .  Yep .  Y do you know where his software is ?  Have you used it at all ?  OK .  So .  I I have as well ,  so if you need need help let me know .  OK .  uuh  And we are  ","And then just close enough so that you get good volume .

But you s  But about the need for transcription ,  I mean , don't we didn't we previously decide that the IBM transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented ?  So , I think having a good tool is worth something no matter what .  So who 's gonna do that ?  Who 's gonna do forced alignment ?  Oh , OK .  OK .  He asked for more work .  It 's interesting ,  uh ,  I talked to some IBM guys , uh , last January , I think , I was there .  And  so people who were working on the on their ViaVoice dictation product .

Right .  Mm - hmm .  But , uh , just to to , um  One more remark , uh , concerning the SRI recognizer .  Um .  It is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath ,  and also laughter is very , very frequent and important to to model .  So ,  if you can in your transcripts mark  mark very audible breaths and laughter especially ,  um  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  It 's not so I don't think it 's , um  As as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between two words I think that 's sufficient ,  because  actually the recognition of laughter once you kn um you know , is pretty good .  So as long as you can stick a you know , a t a tag in there that that indicates that there was laughter ,  that would probably be , uh , sufficient to train models .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Well , the thing that you is hard to deal with is whe when they speak while laughing .  Um , and that 's , uh I don't think that we can do very well with that .  So  But , um , that 's not as frequent as just laughing between speaking ,  so  We tried both .  Uh , currently , um , we use special words .  There was a there 's actually a word for uh , it 's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth  uh , mouth mouth stuff .  And then laughter is a is a special word .  Same thing ?  Yeah .  Yeah . You ha Oh . And each of these words has a dedicated phone .  So the so the the mouth noise , uh , word has just a single phone ,  um , that is for that .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And the the pronun the pronunciations the pronunciations are l are somewhat non - standard .  They actually are  uh , it 's just a single , s uh , you know , a single phone in the pronunciation ,  but it has a self - loop on it ,  so it can  r can go on forever .  It 's just a it 's just a word .  We train it like any other word .  Yeah .  We also tried , um , absorbing these uh , both laughter and and actually also noise ,  and , um  Yes .  OK .  Anyway . We also tried absorbing that into the pause model  I mean , the the the model that that matches the stuff between words .  And , um ,  it didn't work as well . So .  Sorry .

Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to to detect s speech or nonspeech portions in that .  And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system ,  which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech .  And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech .  And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for for speech and nonspeech .  And I did some training on on one dialogue , which was transcribed by  Yeah . We we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription .

Um , and , um , the other thing , uh ,  which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit ,  which is that , um ,  uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain  with , uh , Manolo Pardo and Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was here before ,  was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries .  So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um  h he was looking for , uh , speaker change points .  Um .  As a simplification , he originally did this only using silence as , uh , a putative , uh , speaker change point .  And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance .  And for Broadcast News , that was fine .  Here obviously it 's not .  And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um ,  w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue ,  uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before  and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also ?  So then you 've got you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth .  And you you might  So there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion  because I I thought that it was it 's interesting to look at what features are useful .  But , uh , on the other hand I saw that the they had a good point  that , uh , if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit  Because ultimately we 're gonna end up with some s su kind of structure like that ,  where you have some kind of simple HMM  and you 're testing the hypothesis that , uh , there is a change .  So  so anyway , I just reporting that .  But , uh , uh  So . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Um  That 's great .  Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features .  So you have these twenty - four features .  Uh , a lot of them are spectral features .  Is there a a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ?  Just  OK .  OK . No , I was j curious .  Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application ,  but but Yeah , it 's a  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Excuse me .  Yeah .  The other thing , uh , to keep in mind ,  uh I mean ,  we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling  so that we would actually have data ,  but , um , I think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in  and ultimately that path will be smoothed out .  So I don't know if we have a long - term need to do lots and lots of transcribing .  I think we had a very quick need to get something out  and we 'd like to be able to do some later  because just it 's inter it 's interesting .  But as far a you know , uh , with with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project .  Right .  Yeah .  Right .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  That 's great .  That 's great .  Yeah .  I mean , basically it 's it 's all the difference in the world .  I mean , basically he 's he 's on it now .  So so so this is so i it 'll happen .  Yeah . I mean , basically it 's just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it ,  you know , who just doesn't happen to be here anymore .  Someone else pays him .  So  So . Yeah .  Yeah .  S OK . That 's that 's a good point .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Have , uh , folks from NIST been in contact with you ?  OK .  OK .

So that , you cou yo  Um . I I don't know .  I just it 'd be  If I was actually working on it , I 'd sit there and and play around with it ,  and and get a feeling for it .  I mean , the the the ,  uh  But ,  uh , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a at least .  I don't know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not .  Well , uh , my suggestion now is is on all of these things to , uh , contact Brian .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , just talk to him about it .  I mean , you know , basically he 's he just studies , he 's a colleague ,  a friend ,  and ,  uh , they and and , you know , the the organization always did wanna help us .  It was just a question of getting , you know , the right people connected in , who had the time .  So ,  um , eh  Yeah .  No , I , eh , eh , p  It it oc I h it 's  Yeah , something happened .  I don't know what .  But he 's on it now .  Right .  So , uh ,  where are we ?  Maybe , uh , uh , brief  Well , let 's why don't we talk about microphone issues ?  That was that was a  Oh , I probably would .  I mean , my knowledge is twenty years out of date  but some of it 's still the same .  So  Uh , so maybe we c we can take a look at that .  Mm - hmm .  Well , let 's look at it together  and  Who who are we buying these from ?  That 'd be  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah . We we can try and look at that together .  Well , I think that that 's that 's a good back - off position .  That 's what I was saying earlier ,  th that , you know , we are gonna get some recordings that are imperfect  and , hey , that 's life .  But I I think that it it doesn't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly , if possible ,  because , um , the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table .  I mean , I think , you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway .  So this is just for u these head - mounted mikes are just for use with research .  And , uh , it 's gonna make  You know , if if An - Andreas plays around with language modeling , he 's not gonna be m wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone .

Bmr010.G,"but they didn't have them for breathing in .  Uh  I  Yeah .  I  I mean , I think  It it 's going to be imperfect .  You 're not gonna get it perfect .  And you can do some , uh , you know , first - order thing about it ,  which is to have people move it , uh , uh , a away from being just directly in front of the middle  but not too far away .  And then , you know , I think there 's not much  Because you can't al you know , interfere w  you can't fine tune the meeting that much , I think .  It 's sort of  Mm - hmm .  Uh .

And and  one thing that c that we 're not doing , of course , is we 're not claiming to , uh , get be getting a representation of mankind  in these recordings . We have this very , very tiny sample of of  Uh , yeah .  And Yeah , r right .  So , uh , who knows .  Uh  Yeah . Why don why don't we just since we 're on this vein , why don't we just continue with , uh , what you were gonna say about the transcriptions  and ?  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  OK .  Yes .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right . Well Well , you know , it might be something we 'd wanna do with some , uh , s small subset of the whole thing .  We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything .  Uh - huh .  The other thing we could do , actually , uh , is , uh , use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlaps .  Right ?  Well , that 's one way to do it .  But I 've been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlaps .  Right ?  Given that y and and do so instead of doing phonetic , uh , uh , transcription for the whole thing ,  which we know from the Steve 's experience with the Switchboard transcription is , you know , very , very time - consuming .  And and you know , it took them I don't know how many months to do to get four hours .  And so that hasn't been really our focus .  Uh , we can consider it .  But , I mean , the other thing is since we 've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is is maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlaps .  But anyway , I 'm I 'm open to c our consideration .  I I don't wanna say that by fiat .  I 'm open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful .  And , uh , uh ,  I I I think this year we we actually , uh , can do it .  It 's a we have we have due to @ @ variations in funding we have we seem to be doing , uh , very well on m money for this this year ,  and next year we may have have much less .  So I don't wanna hire a  Uh , I mean , calendar year two thousand one .  Yeah . So it 's uh , it 's we don't wanna hire a bunch of people , a long - term staff ,  because the the funding that we 've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year .  But having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of , uh , funding .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah .  I  I remember when we were transcribing BeRP , uh , uh , uh , Ron Kay , uh , volunteered to to do some of that .  And , he was the first first stuff he did was transcribing Chuck .  And he 's saying "" You you know , I always thought Chuck spoke really well . ""  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something .  Maybe an elaborate one ,  cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments ,  which will also clear things up .  Well , tha that 's that 's debatable .  Right ?  I mean , so the so the argument is that if your statistical system is good it will in fact , uh , clean things up .  Right ?  So it it 's got its own objective criterion .  And , uh , so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough  I mean , to give an example of , um , something we used to do , uh , at one point , uh , back back when Chuck was here  in early times ,  is we would take ,  um , da take a word and , uh , have a canonical pronunciation  ","The other thing we could do , actually , uh , is , uh , use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlaps .  ",
Bmr010.G,"and , uh , if there was five phones in a word , you 'd break up the word , uh , into five equal - length pieces  which is completely gross .  Right ?  I mean , th the timing is off all over the place in just about any word .  But it 's O K .  You start off with that and the statistical system  then aligns things ,  and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad .  So so I think using a a good aligner , um , actually can can help a lot .  Um . But , uh ,  you know , they both help each other .  If you have a if you have a better starting point , then it helps the aligner .  If you have a good alignment , it helps the , uh , th the human in in taking less time to correct things .  So so  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Meaning really isn't my thing .  Um  We 're running a little short here .  We , uh , uh , cou trying to  eh , was p Well , you know , the thing I 'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits  and and I haven't heard , uh , from Jose yet .  So  Uh  Uh  I I I think it you know , another another bunch of digits .  More data is good .  So so I 'd like to do that .  But I think , do you , maybe ,  eh ?  Did you prepare some whole thing you wanted us just to see ?  Or what was that ?  Yeah .  Uh , how long a ?  Yeah .  Yes .  Right .  OK .  But the bottom line is it 's still not , uh , separating out very well .  Right ?  OK .  So that 's  that 's that 's enough then .  OK .  No , I mean , that there 's no point in going through all of that if that 's the bottom line , really .  So , I I think we have to start  Uh , I mean , there there 's two suggestions , really ,  which is , uh what we said before is that ,  um ,  it looks like ,  at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize  so that the energy is anything like a reliable , uh , indicator of the overlap .  Um , I I 'm I 'm still a little f think that 's a little funny . These things l @ @ seems like there should be ,  but but you don't want to keep , uh keep knocking at it if it 's if you 're not getting any any result with that .  But , I mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things ,  so which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator .  Um  But , uh ,  a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , uh , by your colleagues in Spain ,  which is to say , don't worry so much about the , uh , features .  That is to say , use , you know , as as you 're doing with the speech , uh , nonspeech , use some very general features .  And , uh , then , uh , look at it more from the aspect of modeling .  You know , have a have a couple Markov models  and  and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap .  And let the , uh , uh , statistical system determine what 's the right way to look at the data .  I I , um ,  I think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together .  I think that you 'd end up with a better system overall .  But given the limitation in time and given the fact that Javier 's system already exists doing this sort of thing ,  uh , but , uh ,  its main limitation is that , again , it 's only looking at silences which would  maybe that 's a better place to go .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Maybe .  Yeah .  I see .  Ha - h have you ever looked at the , uh , uh Javier 's , uh , speech segmenter ?  Oh . Maybe m you could , you kn uh show Thilo that .  Cuz again the idea is there the limitation there again was that he was he was only using it to look at silence as a as a as a as a p putative split point between speakers .  But if you included , uh , broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases .  Uh  N n  Well , it 's sort of has a simple one .  Right ?  It 's  it 's just it 's just a isn't it just a Gaussian  for each ?  Yeah .  Oh , it doesn't have it doesn't have any temporal , uh ?  I thought it  Yeah .  I gues I guess I don't remember either .  Uh . It 's been a while .  Uh .  Oh , OK . So he 's just he just computes a Gaussian over potential  Oh , I see . I see .  And and  O - k OK . So let me go back to what you had , though .  Um .

Bmr010.G,"I mean , it 's So you have two categories  and you have Markov models for each .  Couldn't you have a third category ?  So you have , uh you have , uh , nonspeech , single - person speech , and multiple - person speech ?  Right ?  And then you have a Markov model for each ?  I see .  I see .  Yeah , I mean , I  This is all pretty gross .  I mean , the th the reason why , uh , I was suggesting originally that we look at features is because I thought , well , we 're doing something we haven't done before ,  we should at least look at the space and understand  It seems like if two people two or more people talk at once , it should get louder ,  uh , and , uh , uh , there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours ,  and , uh , there should overall be a , um , smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum .  So those are all things that should be there .  So far , um , uh , Jose has has been  By the way , I was told I should be calling you Pepe ,  but  by your friends ,  but  Anyway ,  um ,  uh , the has has , uh , been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue  and ,  um ,  as with a lot of things , it is not uh , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds .

Uh , what is it no  Obviously , just a simple number absolute number isn't gonna work .  So it should be with compared to what ?  Should there be a long window for the normalizing factor and a short window for what you 're looking at ?  Or , you know , how b short should they be ?  So ,  th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things  and and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator .  So  I I still have a hunch that there 's it 's in there some place ,  but it may be given that you have a limited time here , it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it .  So pitch - related and harmonic - related , I 'm I 'm somewhat more hopeful for it .

Bmr011.A,"Why is it so cold in here ?  Well , I had a just a quick question  but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed ,  but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker .  I mean , that was  Uh , we started running recognition on one conversation  but it 's the r isn't working yet .  So ,  But if anyone has  uh , the main thing would be if anyone has , um , knowledge about ways to , uh , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition ,  that would be helpful to know about .  Ri - um ,  yeah , the  And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal .  And the reason here is just that for the people doing work  not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,  uh or and even on prosody ,  which Don is gonna be working on soon ,  it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar .  So And I also talked to Mari this morning  and she also had a strong preference for doing that .  And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too .  Mm - hmm .  But we have more than one type of  I mean , for instance , you 're  Right .  But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful .  But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting .  Right .  Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n uh ,  so yeah , uniformity would be great .  Well Jane would know more about the transcribers .  Right .  So does the recognizer .  Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w  Right .  Right .  That 's OK .  Great , great .  Great , thank you very much .  It 's makes our job a lot easier .  You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting .  Mm - hmm .  Right ,  right .  Yeah .  Right .  I mean , it seems  it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this ,  just getting the data ,  because there 's a number of sites  like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good ,  um , but they 'll be recording with video  and they 'll be  You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , uh , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go  since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings ,  um , and just have this other information available .  So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure  and then ,  I don't know ,  save it out  or have whoever 's interested  save that data out ,  transfer it there ,  it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . I think .  Well , if  Even if we 're not  I 'm not sure about video .  That 's sort of an video has a little different nature since  right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .

Well if there 's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these f those  So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment ,  uh , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data ,  who 's interested ,  and even if ICSI it itself isn't .  Um , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ?  I don't know .  You know ? The  So  Yeah .  I mean it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of  once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data .

Right , I mean , just it 'd be nice if we have more information on the same data .

Bmr011.A,"I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system .  Oh . Oh .  Mmm .  Hmm .  Yeah .  I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files .  And I I mean , I know you . I know what your voice sounds like . I 'm sort of familiar with  Uh , it 's pretty hard to follow , especially  there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before .  Uh , it sort of depends where you are in  Mm - hmm .  Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ?  In other words , if  Yeah .  Cuz  OK .  Actu  yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of  um , you know ,  yeah ,  whether to  OK , so this is a , um ,  and actually I should say this is what Don has b uh , he 's already been really helpful in , uh , chopping up these  So so first of all you  um , I mean , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .  Um , but second of all , uh in general because some of these channels ,  I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are  have a lot of cross - ta  sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .  Um , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition ,  especially forced alignment .  So ,  uh , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed  which we did have some problems with ,  and Thilo , uh , I think told me why this was ,  but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning ,  so  the SRI re  and they  They were not  Yeah .  So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments .  So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , um , cuts that you made on the mixed signal .  And so that every every speaker has the same cuts .  And if they have speech in it we run it through .  And if they don't have speech in it we don't run it through .  And we base that knowledge on the transcription .  Um , the problem is if we have no time marks ,  then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word .  And so  I mean , if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , uh , you know , par paragraph of of talk ,  uh , I don't know how they do this .  Um , we actually don't know which piece goes where .  And , um , I think with  No , we used the fact that  So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this ,  whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not ,  they have a chunk and then they transcribes the words in the chunk .  And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary .  But there 's first a chunk and then a transcription .  Then a chunk , then a transcription .  That 's great ,  cuz the recognizer can  Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think .  Th - but there 's going to be a real problem ,  uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were ,  which segment they belonged to .  So that 's sort of what I 'm worried about right now .  If you do a forced alignment on something really  well even if you do it on something really long you need to know  you can always chop it up  but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , uh , chop .  So  Yeah .  Maybe they have some you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers  uh , I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . That would help .  But ,  uh , it 's just an unknown right now .  So .  Right . But the it is true that the segments I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you  but the segments that in your first meeting are great .  I mean , that 's that 's a good length .  Right , cuz  y yeah .  And actually as you get transcripts just , um , for new meetings , um , we can try  I mean , the the more data we have to try the the alignments on , um , the better .  So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers ,  just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of uh , parameters f on the recognizer ,  cuz that would be helpful .  Especially as you get , en more voices .  The first meeting had I think just four people ,  yeah .  Oh , great ,  great .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Right .  Mmm .  So this is like gestural uh , these g  ","there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before .  um , I mean , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .  Um , but second of all , uh in general because some of these channels ,  sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .  Um , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition ,  especially forced alignment .  So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments .  So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , um , cuts that you made on the mixed signal .  And so that every every speaker has the same cuts .  Um , the problem is if we have no time marks ,  then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word .  Th - but there 's going to be a real problem ,  uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were ,  which segment they belonged to .  ",
Bmr011.A,"Right .  OK .  Right .  But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data ,  like  so that you can do far field studies of those gestures  or um ,  or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ?  Or ?  I see .  Uh - huh .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right . Yeah , that would be good .  Right .  That 's true .  I guess I wanted to , um , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings .  Um ,  I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore  and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before  but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , "" well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow  and try to convince people "" .  So I 'm gonna try . Go to their meeting tomorrow  and see if we can try , uh , to convince them  because they have  And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here  and definitely than the front end meeting , probably .  Um  Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things  and , uh , just dialogue - wise ,  right .  Um , so I 'll try .  And then the other thing is ,  I don't know if this is at all useful ,  but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building  to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch ,  if we can still offer that ,  might be willing  non - ICSI , non - academic ,  you know , like government people ,  I don't know .  So .  Is is it in these departments ?  Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again  because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings  and just also more data .  So .  So I actually wrote to him and he answered , "" great , that sounds really interesting "" .  But I never heard back  because we didn't actually advertise openly .  We a I mean w  I told I d asked him privately .  Um , and it is a little bit of a trek for campus folks .  Um , so it 's still worthwhile .  So  Exactly ,  and and  and I was thinking  Yeah .  Plus we could also get you know , a s a student .  And I 'm willing to try to learn .  I mean , I 'm I would do my best .  Um , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , um , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging ,  disfluency tagging ,  um , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling .  And Mari 's also interested in it ,  Andreas as well .  So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , "" well "" , and that "" well "" is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .  Uh , and things like that ,  um ,  th  A lot of it can be done  Great . So a a lot of this kind of  I think there 's a second pass  and I don't really know what would exist in it .  But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not ,  or  um , that maybe these transcribers could do .  So  Yeah .  That 'd be great .  Oh , yeah .  Oh , that we could .  OK .  I thought that all these people had sort of said "" no "" twice already .  If that 's not the case then  Just  OK .  Right .  Right . That was a big fear .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I mean , it One thing that would be nice  and this it sounds bizarre  but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion ,  like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that .  And so I was thinking if there 's any like Berkeley political groups or something .  I mean , that 'd be perfect .  Some group , "" yes , we must ""  Well , you know , something  Um  Well , OK .  No , but maybe stu student , uh , groups or , um , film - makers , or som Something a little bit colorful .  And I don't mean that they 're angry  but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat .  So if anyone has ideas ,  I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people  but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing .  Or  That 's  I was thinking , knowing the , uh , n National Institute of Standards , it is all  Yeah ,  mm - hmm .  Exactly , that 's what I was  something where there there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing .  Uh , anyway , if you if you have ideas  Yeah , we could  I 'm I 'm actually serious  because , uh , you know , we have the set up here  and and that that has a chance to give us some very interesting fun data .

Well I think that that was just sort of  I I already asked Thilo  but that , um , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , um , people who are doing any kind of post - processing ,  whether it 's to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both ,  um , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition .  Um , so , i is that Who else is work  I guess Dan Ellis and you  and Dave .  OK .  OK .  I don't know .  I 'm bad  It 's like like  It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear  but I 'm not an expert .  It seems like a problem with cross - talk .  That that may be true .  But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods  That 's true .  Oh , I don't know .  All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , uh , techniques .  And so it 'd be w good to know about it .  R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K  because the t no one transcribed any words there  and we throw it out .  But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time ,  so you get some speech and then a "" mm - hmm "" , and some more speech ,  so that whole thing is one chunk .  And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it ,  that 's where it 's a big problem .  The energy ,  right . Exactly .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker ,  because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will  for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries ,  because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features .  And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .  Um , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio ,  which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel ,  um , or to have very to have closer , um , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech  that gets transcribed in it , or both .  And it 's just sort of a open world right now of exploring that .  So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good .  Uh , the IBM one is more it 's an open question right now .  And then the issue of like global processing of some signal  and then , you know , before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that .  Mm - hmm .  Right . You can , um  The problem is just that the acoustic  when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , um , you you 'll get , a uh an alignment with the wrong duration pattern  or it  Yeah . It 's not the fact that you have like  I mean , what he did is allow you to have , uh , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations .  Right , things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong  cuz what they had done there is align and then chop .  Um , and this problem is a little bit j more global .  It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments ,  uh , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word .  And it tends to do that .  S  So , uh ,  but we probably will have to do something like that in addition .  Anyway . So , yeah , bottom bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , uh , detecting energies ,  because that that 'll really help us .

Is that is that basically the point ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right , so one th  uh , well one thing I was gonna say was that , um , i we could get more , uh , of the head mounted microphones  even beyond the number of radio channels we have  because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order .  And the main thing is having the microphone close to you ,  u although , not too close .  Yeah .  Is .  Yes .  Right .  How am I d  Yeah .  Well , I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around ,  so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of  if this microphone seems OK to people ,  uh , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things .  Yeah .  Yeah .  No , but my point is  R r right  Right now , we 've got , uh , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard .  So why don't we replace those  Well , however many we can plug in .  You know , if we can plug in three , let 's plug in three .  Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio ,  and so then that would be , you know , three more .  So , uh so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do ,  but have them all be the same mike .

All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings .  And , uh , it is related to ours .  They were interested in ours .  They wanted to get some uniformity with us , uh , about the transcriptions and so on .  And one one notable difference u u  actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not ,  but one one , uh , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes .  So , um , I mean , I 'll just tell you the party line on that .  The reason I didn't go for that here was because , uh , the focus , uh , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was uh , in impromptu situations .  And  we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations  but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it .  And so , uh , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it .  But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , uh , one or more other people i uh , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be .

It was just , you know , yet another piece of research  and it seemed like we had enough troubles just  No . So there 's there 's uh , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this .  So , um ,  the , uh the big arrays ,  uh , places , uh , like uh , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places ,  uh , they have , uh , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something .  And so there 's a wall of mikes .  And you get really , really good beam - forming with that sort of thing .  And it 's and , um ,  in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing  and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff ,  but it d it d we ended up not doing it .

Bmr011.B,"Yeah , our block of wood is unique .  But the But the  No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something  and and , uh ,  um  So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do .  Um , so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do .  I mean , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask .  Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask "" um , are you recording video ? ""  Um , right ?  And and the acoustic people will always say , "" well are you doing , uh , uh , array microphones ? ""  So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .  So maybe maybe we 'll do some more of it .  Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the  But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction .  Well , uh , at some level at some level .  But then , you know , there 's it there 's  There 's  I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is .  Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space .  And , th  Yeah .  Yeah .  But I mean , uh , for optimum flexibility later you 'd want to save each channel .  But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional .  Right ?  So  See the problem is it it took , uh , uh , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes .  And it was a really big deal .  And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily  and , uh , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort .  But , e I think for  I mean , how we 're gonna decide  For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .  I mean , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can  And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up ,  we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels  and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes .  And there we 're already using fourteen .  E  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . So I think you 'd need a separate a separate set up  and the assumption that you could time align the two .  I 'm not so much worried about disk space actually .  I mentioned that , b as a practical matter ,  but the real issue is that , uh , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew .  So you would have a t completely separate set up ,  which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this .  So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later ,  but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times .  And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have ,  one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something .  So basically  or a hun  Yeah .  So , I 'm kinda skeptical ,  but um I think that  So , uh , I don't think we can share the resource in that way .  But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours  which might be useful for for them .  And then we can offer up the room ,  Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space ,  and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on .  Yeah .  Well I thi  yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do .  Uh , we 'll see .  Right , so we have we  Yeah , so it 's , uh , people people getting shy about it .  There 's this human subjects problem .  There 's the fact that then um , if  i I I 've heard comments about this before ,  "" why don't you just put on a video camera ? ""  But you know , it 's sort of like saying , "" uh , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things ,  ","So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .

I mean , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can  I 'm not so much worried about disk space actually .  but the real issue is that , uh , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew .  but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times .  And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have ,  one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something .  So , I 'm kinda skeptical ,  But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours  which might be useful for for them .  Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space ,  and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on .  There 's this human subjects problem .  ",
Bmr011.B,"uh , but , uh , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . ""  I mean , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in .  And , uh , you really want to do it right .  So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that .  We there will be other meeting recordings . We won't be the only place doing meeting recordings .  We are doing what we 're doing .  And , uh , hopefully it 'll be useful .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , we we  We we we we don't , uh  we don't we don't perform electro - shock during these meetings ,  and  Yeah .  OK .  Uh , transcriptions .  So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go  Are you ?  But they 're not giving f really fine time markings .  Um , it 's historical .  I mean ,  uh , some point ago we thought that uh , it "" boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that "" ,  you know , like we just did ,  and , um , here 's , uh , a a , uh , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it .  So , that was a contribution they could make . Uh in terms of time , money , you know ?  And it still might be a good thing  but  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so .  We 'll see .  I mean , I think , th you know , they they they 've proceeded along a bit . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , uh , you know , have some more discussions with them .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I I think that they are ,  um ,  yeah , I 'm sure they will  and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it .  I mean , it sounds like Liz has some concerns  and  That 's great .  I guess the other thing ,  I I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , uh , I know you and I talked about this a little bit ,  there was an issue of , uh ,  suppose we get in the , uh ,  I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain ,  uh , where we we ,  uh uh ,  we have all the data transcribed  and we have these transcribers  and we were we 're the  we 're still a bit slow on feeding  at that point we 've caught up  and the the the , uh , the weak link is is recording meetings .  OK ,  um ,  two questions come , is you know what how how do we  uh , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point  but how do we step out the recorded meetings ?  And the other one is , um , uh , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ?  So , um , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting  but there was  Right , so I think we talking about three level three things .  One one was uh , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings ,  types of overlaps , and so forth that that someone could do .  Second was , uh , somewhat lower level  just doing these more precise timings .  And the third one is is , uh , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have  which is that , um , if , uh if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech .  For instance , uh , marking in some overlapping  potentially overlapping fashion , uh , the value of , uh , ar articulatory features .  You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here ,  there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth .  Um , as opposed to doing phonetic uh , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis ,  and , uh , assuming , uh , articulatory feature values for those those things .  Um , obviously that 's extremely time - consuming .  Uh  but , uh ,  we could do it on some small subset .  Mm - hmm .  Well , yeah ,  but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone  at that point  because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here  and and and it 's  so I  Yeah , describe describe it .  Now I 'm suggesting articulatory features .  Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it  but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things ,  um , and uh ,  I mean , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to  Sort of .  I mean , it 's still  some sort of categories  but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things  ","I mean , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in .

Bmr011.B,"and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just "" click ,  you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound "" and so on .  Yeah , something like that .  I mean , actually if we get into that it might be good to , uh , uh , haul John Ohala into this  and ask his his views on it I think .  No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally .

And , uh , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level ,  and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others .  Yeah .  Yeah  and hopefully someone would make use of it .  I mean , people didn't  uh , I mean , people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT  and , uh w due to its markings ,  and then the Switchboard transcription thing ,  well I think has been very useful for a lot of people .  So  Yeah .  Yeah .  Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings ,  right ?  Mm - hmm .  Yes .  Great .  Yeah .  He - he 's supposed he 's supposed to be trained to do it .  Mm - hmm .  I think they 're open to it .  I think , you know , all these things are  I think there 's  we should go beyond , uh , ICSI  but , I mean , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could .

And , um So , um , it seems to me in terms of like ,  um , i i it wou  You know , OK .  So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room  and how it how the recordings are done ,  and that kind of thing .  And , um . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , uh , handle multi - channel recording .  Yeah , OK .  Yeah .  Well that 's OK , I mean we 'll  Yeah , and it 's t and it looks really great .  He he has a prototype .  I I , uh , @ @ didn't didn't see it , uh , yesterday  but I 'm going to see it today .  And , uh , that 's that will enable us to do nice um , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments .

He needs to uh , leave for uh , from here to make a two forty - five flight  from from Oakland .  So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight  but do you think that , um that , uh , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not .  I have no idea .  It 's premature .  Fine .  Good .  OK .  Well one thing I I mean , I don't know .  I mean , I know that having an array of I mean , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones .  But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off uh , channels when you 're later on ?  I mean , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ?  I see .  Fine .  OK .  Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ?  A permission form ?  You were here at a meeting before .  Did you sign a form ?  OK .  OK .  You don't you don't have to leave for it .  But I just  you know .  o  Transcriptions , OK .

Bmr011.G,"So first of all , um , I 've got eight transcribers .  Uh , seven of them are linguists .  One of them is a graduate student in psychology .  Um , Each I gave each of them , uh , their own data set .  Two of them have already finished the data sets .  And the meetings run , you know , let 's say an hour . Sometimes as man much as an hour and a half .  Oh , it 's what I mean is one meeting .  Each each person got their own meeting .  I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of of when to stop transcribing this one  or  So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose ,  and and and so  And , uh , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases .  So , you know , that means  you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on  Uh , right now all eight of them have differe uh , uh , additional data sets . That means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month .  Hope so .  But the pre - segmentation really helps a huge amount .  And , uh , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the , uh the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps .  But , um ,  just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .  She said it takes about , uh , sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time .  So it 's about twelve to one ,  which is what we were thinking .  It 's well in the range .  OK . Uh , these still , when they 're finished , um , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all  but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned .  OK , now I wanted to mention the , um , teleconference I had with , uh , Jonathan Fiscus .  We spoke for an hour and a half  and , um , had an awful lot of things in common .  He , um , um , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been ,  uh , looking , uh , uh , spending a lot of time with  I 'm not quite sure the connection ,  but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system .  And I guess that I mean , I I need to read up on that .  And there 's a web site that has lots of papers .  But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach .  So what he wants me to do  and what we what we will do and uh , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting  for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System .  And they do have some sort of software ,  at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS  and that he wants to experiment with taking our data  and putting them in that format , and see how that works out .  I I I explained to him in in detail the , uh , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript .  And , um ,  you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately  and and the focus on reliability .  He expressed a lot of interest in reliability .  It 's like he 's he 's really up on these things .  He 's he 's very  Um , independently he asked , "" well what about reliability ? ""  So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing .  OK , um  Well , you know , at this point I think  Uh , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this .  I need to acquaint myself more with it .  But , um , there there is a way of viewing  Uh , whenever you have coding categories , um , and you 're dealing with uh , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , uh , choices that you could use for each each of them .  And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Including LDC .  I think so .  Mm - hmm . Then there 's their web site that has lots of papers .  And I looked through them  and they mainly had to do with this , um , this , uh , tree structure , uh , annotated tree diagram thing .  So , um , um and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all .  And he was , you know , very interested .  And , "" oh , and how 'd you handle this ? ""  And I said , "" well , you know , this way ""  and And and we had a really nice conversation .  Um , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury .  So , um , I corresponded briefly with him .  I , uh , c I  ","So first of all , um , I 've got eight transcribers .  Uh , seven of them are linguists .  One of them is a graduate student in psychology .  And , uh , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases .  But the pre - segmentation really helps a huge amount .  And , uh , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the , uh the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps .  just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .

And what he said was that , um , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information .  And , um , that 's , uh You know , I need to get back to him and and , uh , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific ,  but I just haven't had time yet .

He downloaded from the CD onto audio tapes .  And apparently he did it one channel per audio tape .  So each of these people is transcribing from one channel .

I have t I , you know I  I think it would be difficult to do it that way . I really  d uh , in my case  Yes .  Well I th I think so .  Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah .  I agree .  And especially since a lot of these  Yeah , we have .

Yeah , well  Well , I have to ask him .  And that 's that 's my email to him . That needs to be forthcoming .  But but the , uh I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people ,  and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of  So , you know , one of these people was was transcribing the , uh , networks group talk  and she said , "" I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , ""  "" but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the that 's the convention and I just ""  Cuz you know , if you don't know  Yeah .

Uh , maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that uh , the first transcribed meeting ,  the one that I transcribed .  Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ?  Oh , I see .  Oh , darn .  Of course , of course , of course .  Yeah , OK .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Excellent , good .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday  and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you .  Yeah .  And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , uh , Dave finishes the  and maybe it 's already finished  the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .  Uh , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps .

Yeah .  The types of overlaps  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels ,  wouldn't it ?  I mean , I would think that that , uh , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was .  I think vowels vowels are I think harder .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm , OK .  Yeah , I 'm sure .  Uh , yeah , I I know .  That 's nice .  Yeah .  Excellent .  It 's a nice balance .

One of them is , um , Jerry Feldman 's group ,  they they , uh , are they  I know that they recorded one meeting .  Are they willing ?  Mm - hmm .  Oh .  That 's important .  Joe Sokol ?  We might be able to get the administration  I see that Lila has a luncheon meeting in here periodically .  I don't know  Yeah .  Yeah ,  of course there is this problem though , that if we give them the chance to excise later we e might end up with like five minutes out of a f of m one hour  of Yes . Really .  Well there was this K P F A  but  OK .  OK ,  OK .  And I had one other one other aspect of this  which is , um , uh , uh , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar uh y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers .  Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather  but that 's what he wanted me to show him .  So I 'm giving him our , um our initial meeting  because he asked for all English .  And I think we don't have a lot of all English meetings right now .  That 's what I mean , yeah .  He doesn't care .  No . Eh , well , British is OK .  But but  Sure , sure , sure .  Yeah . Different varieties of English .  Native speaking . Native speaking English .  Yes .  Oh , really .  That 's funny .  Alright .  And so that would make sense .  I didn't have the context of that .  All America , OK .  I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way ,  aren't they ?  I mean , I sort of feel like they have  It 's be fun .  We could get Julia Child .  I know .  It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the  Yeah .  Pre - processing .  You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well ,  the encoding of the  And and he also , he was  I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop  that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , I w Uh - huh .  Well , you 're saying So , uh , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and and and slam the door and stuff ?  Or some other kind of thing ?  Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much .  The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c uh , time things .  But I I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you  which is that it sounded to me , Liz , as though you  and , uh , maybe I didn't q understand this ,  but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together .  And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker ,  and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer .

And is there any um i  are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?  OK .  Right .  OK .  So so the th  So so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,  I mean segment them but not downsample them .  And and feed them to feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if if the SRI front - end does something .  Well  Right and and it doesn't is no more work for um you know for us .

I should I should say that the language model is not just Switchboard  I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News  but with a little less weight  I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection  um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .  I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better  We we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here .  That 's you know if if there are more machines um uh here  plus people can could run their own uh you know variants of of of the recognition runs  So so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,  I mean segment them but not downsample them .  And and feed them to feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if if the SRI front - end does something .  And and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why  Mel cepstrum .  ",

Well , we don't even know what that means ,  so I  Yeah .  Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety - three workshop  and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .  you know  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh one thing I guess I didn't get  so you know the language model was straight from from bigram from Switchboard  the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or or  So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?  OK .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah ,  but for Broadcast News when we we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .  Uh - huh .  Good point .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah  I I I would bet on that too  cuz he certainly in that when as a as a burp user he was he was a pretty uh strong one .  Yeah .  Sheep .  Yeah .  Sheep is good .  Yeah .  Have to add PZM and so on  but  Yeah .  I r  Oh  Yeah ,  which I would which well n n n n  I mean there 's still just the w the percentages  and , I mean they 're not a  as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps  there 's probably overlaps in in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well  so  but but there 's other phenomena ,  it 's a meeting ,  it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes  but uh  yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could ,  I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way  but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the  and uh see if it 's , you know  is it a hundred twenty percent  or maybe it 's not  maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something  and and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that  that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit  so  Yeah .  Yeah and  well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training ,  yeah .  Seems reasonable .  Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,  say it 's OK .  Well we ,  I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it  hopefully it will be fairly quick  but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on  it 's just that we 're  It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .  So you just train just different filters  and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is  Right .  Are you are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?  So probably doesn't matter .  But but it wouldn't hurt to try ,  yeah .  Sure .  No the reason I say this  PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing  but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not b you wouldn't expect to be so much  but  This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz .

I mean we do we we we we we wanna find all this stuff out ,  we don't know .  Uh yeah .  Yeah .  Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?  Yeah .  Well what I was just suggesting is is we have these this cross pad just for this purpose  and just use that  and if we sink it in  The other thing is eh  I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan  but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?

Well  no they 'll just charge us more ,  so it 's this  Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .  Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .

I guess what time do we have to leave ?  Three thirty ?  Yeah ,  so .

Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who  Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed  and um you know separated used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used  and uh Don sampled that so so eight K  um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes ,  up to synch time of one two zero zero  so is that that 's twenty minutes or so ?  Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,  and Don can talk to Jane about this ,  there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh  I 'm we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier .  Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually  um  There 's there 's a  yeah ,  so that actually  um  if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know  Wel  No actually it was  yeah i it was a complicated bug  because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random  so  um  Yeah  so that 's what we have  but that that will be completely gone if this synch time problem  So you guys know .  Yeah .  So here 's the actual copy of the email  um oh OK  so does this glitch occur at other  Oh .  Right .  And is it only once that that happens ?  OK .  There 's the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong  but  OK  so that 's actually  It y it 's  OK  no  What happens is it actually affects the script that Don  I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it  but they  Yeah .  Well , the the synch time the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,  right ?  There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .  And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right  so anyway it 's it 's just  that 's why we only have twenty minutes  but there 's a significant amount of  Yeah that was fine .  That that was OK .  Well that would really be a problem ,  yeah .  So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .  um and what 's which  this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,  there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different  so you can see some like this Trent Lott which  um I mean  these are sort of funny ones ,  there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references ,  I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see  but  um it 's pretty good .  Well so I guess we can generate  um  there 's  No those are actually  a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,  so is it like PZM is three words ,  it 's PZM ,  I mean there 's nothing  There 's no language model for PZM or  um  No language model , I mean those  Well well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet  and I mean um anyway there  so but this is really encouraging because  so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of of r reasonable s you know Switchboard  this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained mostly trained recognizer  and Switchboard - two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic  and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one  so there was @ @ so that 's great .  Um  Oh yeah  I mean this is really ,  and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a  eh um  yeah  So and what al also this means is that  um  I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people  especially I guess um with Jane that that would help for  since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring .  I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by  Yeah .  No .

Bmr012.C,"so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from  it 's it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount  but we won't know  because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .  So .  Right .  Right , so it 's so  Yeah  so I wou  so that 's good .  Yeah .  Like Trent Lott must have been from  I guess Switchboard was before  uh .  The j  Yeah  but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance  and uh and that 's interesting  cuz I think the their language models are quite different  so  and I I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .  So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when when we get new microphones  that would be worth it  um  Yeah  he he he sounded to me just from he sounded like a ,  what 's it a sheep or a goat ?  Sheep ,  right .  Sounded good .  Right so um so I guess the good news is that  and and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system  and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings .  So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no no tailoring at all .  Yeah .  The voca the vocabulary especially  yeah .  Yeah , so .  Yeah .  It 's pretty good  um so then  PZM  and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven  and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL .  there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things  but in general it was really good  and I 'm hoping  and this is this is good news  because that means the force alignments should be good  and if the force alignments ,  I mean it 's good news anyway  but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information .  For example about , you know prosodic information  and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times .  Um so that 'll be something that  actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place .  Because it 's just gonna give us time marks  so .  For forced alignment .  Ye - right .  Right .  So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality  and then I was thinking it  Oh  or i have someone look at the alignments  uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .  Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good  because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .  It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around ,  if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK  but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good .  So that 's about it .  This i  yeah .  This is not that good .  Right .  Yeah .  No I think it 's really ,  I mean this way we least have a baseline  we know that for instance the transcripts are very good  so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the the text  um yeah they 're pretty good  so and and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth  it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard  so that 's good .  And um let 's see  there was one more thing I wanted to to mention  I can't remember  um  Sorry can't remember .  anyway it 's  well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself  so Andreas set up this recognizer and  by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there  so I brought back just these result files  and people can look at them  um so  From the outside world or  Um oh .  Well OK  we have n no names .  Although I sh um  de audio data itself ?  Uh so well I can I can protect my directories through there .  Right now they 're not they 're in the speech group directories which so I will  I didn't know that actually .  Yeah OK .  Right OK .  That 's true .  Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .  Don did this .  Re - re ref  yeah .  Missing all the vowels .  Some of the vowels ,  almost all the vowels ,  that 's the hard part .  Yeah we could we could try that and and compare  Yeah .  We can try it .  I I only downsampled them first cuz I was  yeah  Well they 're just bigger to transfer ,  that 's why I s downsampled them before but  Well I mean that was if it 's the same then we can downsample here  but if it 's  ","and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings .

Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless  Right .

Yeah , it 's alright .  So , the gain isn't real good .  OK ,  so we are recording .  Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .  Um we we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once  but everyone does need to do it .  And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .  We we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on  so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank .  Um I I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,  so  California .  Sure .  Oh .  Birth year ?  Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .  Either way  yeah I think I think age is alright  and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that  so , anyway .  And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time  even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting .  OK ?  And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form .  And that should just be one person whose name I don't know .  OK ?  Uh sure .  Thank you .  OK so should we do agenda items ?  Uh well I have I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .  And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results .  Anything else ?  Why don't you go first then .  Or so .  Hmm .  I  was that did that did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?  I don't remember when it is .  Oh no .  Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .  Alright .  The the glitch  yeah .  Th - the  yeah .  There there there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized  so the that that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second  and so the channels get a little asynchronous  and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing doing click sounds .  But  yeah  it  right once in the middle .  Um But that shouldn't affect anything  yeah yeah  "" bah ""  Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .  But I I do remember  I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .  Where where they weren't monotonic .  Oh OK  so that 's  yeah sounds like a bug .  The other one I saw was that it  yeah .  The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times  and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .  So that 's very encouraging .  I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices  because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?  Sounds likes ?  Yeah ,  and who cares ?  And and there were lots of of course the "" uh uh "" - s , "" in on "" - s "" of uh "" - s .  Right .  Ri - ri right .  Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?  Do you mean so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ?  Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .  Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .  Yeah , that 's right .  Right .  Excellent .  Well especially for the very first run , I mean you  the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error  but  Not Switchboard ,  uh Broadcast News .  Yeah , so that 's great .  Yeah .  Right , it was not a big deal .  Although combining em worked well .  And it said a hundred percent male ?  Oh it did ?  It got all two genders ?  Right .  Sheep .  A sheep .  Baah .  Or just dictionary .  And I have to try it on the far field mike  yeah .  Well we 've done that for one meeting .  Uh oh oh  f not for words  I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not not for words .  Right .  ",Uh well I have I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .  And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results .

And I have to try it on the far field mike  ,"The group also discussed recording setup and equipment issues. The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data. It was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the SRI recognizer to compare recognition performance, and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible. "
Bmr012.E,"So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription .  Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .  Right , right .  That we 're starting so well ?  Don't worry about it  w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes .  Try it on the P Z Ms and and  Yeah , abso  well no but  Yeah , it 's really good .  It 's human subjects issues ,  I told you about that .  That that 's not the issue ,  it 's just the audio data itself ,  until people have a chance to edit it .  It 's us .  Alright  we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts  and get back any bleeps that they want  I don't think we even know which one  I assume you 're using syncat to do it ?  Or sound resample ?  Resample .  Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms .  Not all of them .  And a few of the consonants .  I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization ,  but  Sure .  Mm - hmm .  It 's about a fifty minute drive ,  right ?  It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that .  I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other  I don't think that gives you any information .  Yep .  Yeah .  Yep .  There 's one level that 's already happening right here .  Right .  And it gets downsampled to sixteen .  So  And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,  so  Telephone .  So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .  That isn't music .  Why is that ?  All the way around I 'd think .  Yeah .  We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .  Dot EDU ?  Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .  Yeah , and use that .  Not a bad idea .  I don't know .  I don't know .  I 'll send mail to Dan and ask .  I I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort  because it 's one board with two digital channels .  E eight each .  So it it takes two fibers in to the one board .  And so w I think if we wanna do that more than that we 'd have to have two boards ,  and then you have the synchronization issue .  Right .  Eight .  It 's eight .  I have no idea .  But each each fiber channel has eight eight channels  and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .  So  Yeah .  I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .  So I I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .  OK on the uh  are we done with that ?  So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes ,  so I got a quote  um  We can fit we have room for one more wireless  and the wireless ,  this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars ,  it I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner the receiver the other end ,  that 's uh four thirty  um and then also  Yep .  And we just need one more so so  Yeah .  So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .  Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony  believe it or not  and Sony only sells this headset .  So if we wanna use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and they apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end  and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself .  And that 's the other solution  and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece  and the he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .  Becau - the reason is the only only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .  Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,  so .  So so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?  OK .  So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?  And and see if that works .  Yeah .  Right ,  it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .  Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA  and so it will take about a week to get here .  Um so OK to just go order ?  OK  and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice  cuz I think that 's how we did it before .  OK .  And then nine channels is the maximum we can do ,  so .  Without getting more stuff .  Right .  Probably .  I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the  Yeah , somehow .  It 's not a bad idea .  A hand - held ,  yeah .  Well we could just hand around the lapel .  Rather than get a  do you want a handset ?  Well I mean is the is the hand - held really any better ?  OK .  Is awful ?  OK .

Bmr012.E,"So I wonder if they have one that will hook up .  I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .  What ?  It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike ,  isn't it ?  OK .  And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?  OK I 'll I 'll ask .  Yeah .  OK  so I guess people who have to leave can leave  and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?  OK .  uh Yep ,  that 's good .  Yep ,  that 'd be very interesting .  I 'd love to hear what they have to say .  Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .  Give us a status .  That would be weird .  Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?  I assume we 're not gonna try to record it ?  Alright .  Unless there 's anything else ?  Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ?  Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that ,  so .  I mean other than free free form .  And just clip it to your collar .  Great .

Yeah , we had to get them to approve em  and then i cuz cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's  but this this meeting that you have , no problem  cuz I I well I mean I I speak for myself  but but I think that we didn't do anything that but  well anyway so uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that  although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course  but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects  and I don't know how that stands ,  I mean if you if you get fantastic results and it 's involving data which which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know  but I wanted to raise that issue ,  that 's all .

Yeah , exa exactly  I guess nested several layers ,  but  Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,  yeah .  Have them talk about the data and they and they 've made observations to me  like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does  but there are other groups of similar size that have very little ,  you know it 's part of it 's it 's the norm of the group and all that  and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .

So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , um , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals .  ",
Bmr016.B,"uh , and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated  and then we 'll rerun the script and produce better uh versions .  But the I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing  you 'd have to constantly re rerun that ,  so , maybe  OK .

Um , I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms  and I don't know exactly who to ask .  I thought that maybe you would be the the person to talk to .  So , is it a lossless compression when you compress ,  so  It just uses entropy coding ?  OK .  So , I mean , I guess my question would be is  I just got this new eighteen gig drive installed .  Um , yeah ,  which is  I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it .  But um ,  yeah , I don't know what 's typical here ,  but um ,  it 's local though ,  so  But  OK .  Alright .  How do you do that ?  Eighteen .  Oh I see .  OK .  Alright , I did know that .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  OK .  Right .  Right .  I mean all of this stuff can be regenerated ,  it 's just a question  OK .  Yeah , I guess  Right .  OK .  So , I mean , I guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ?  Um  Right .  OK .  Do you think that 'd be OK ?  To downsample them ?  OK .  Yeah , I guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques .  Right .  r  Yeah .  Yeah those are gonna be kept .  Right .  OK . Alright .  I mean , I could just u do a DU on it right ?  And just see which how much is on each  So .  OK .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I replace the "" cuz "" with "" because "" if it 's glossed .  And  Right .  It 's like the z Zapruder Film .  Jane , can I ask you a question ?  What 's that very last one correspond to ?  I don't even know how to pronounce that .  Uh , is that like someone 's like burning or some such thing ?  Like their hair 's on fire ?  Uh , it looks like that .  Right .  But that 's not really like  No one really says "" argh , "" you know ,  it 's not  Well ,  there 's another there 's another word error .  Cha - ching .  Oh yeah ?  Mmm .  That 's true .  Mm - hmm .  All the "" EH "" 's I 've seen have been like that .  They 've been like "" eh ""  like that have bee has been transcribed to "" EH "" .  And sometimes it 's stronger ,  like "" eeh "" which is like closer to "" EH "" .  But .  I know .  We should go off - line .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , we don't have that many acronyms comparatively in this meeting .  It 's not so bad .  Mmm .  That 's not bad .  There 's a lot of "" OK 's "" .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Is this after like did you do some uh replacements for all the different form of "" OK "" to this ?  OK .  Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it .  That 's kind of disturbing .  Anyway .  Mm - hmm .  That 's alright .  I 'm just pointing that out .  There 's  Hmm .  Sh - shouldn't it be "" QUAL TICKLE "" or something ?  Like it 's not  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  Oh I see .  OK .  Yeah .  It 's not something you wanna replace with  but  It 's just disturbing .  That 's great .  Um  Yeah .  You need a lot of  You need a lot of qualification Adam .  Subtext .  Yeah , that was in the first meeting .  Right .  There 's a "" numbers "" tag  I 'm sorry I 'm I didn't follow that last thing .  Right .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So , uh , have those e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already , have those been channelized ?  And I know I 've seen @ @ I 've seen they 've been channelized ,  but  have they uh have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted , uh , p on a per channel  So ,  I guess , I mean , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not ,  but I  Yeah , I know .  No , but I mean my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized ,  like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing ,  and we start like branching off into the into the our layer of uh transcripts .  Right .  OK .  No I know I know that adjusting those things are gonna is gonna make it better .  I mean I 'm sure about that ,  but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done ,  or when you expect them to finish it , or  Yeah .  ","Yeah those are gonna be kept .

Bmr016.C,"Yeah .  Yeah , I don't doubt it .  Um , so .  Yeah . I 'm doing it myself .  I mean i if the time markings aren't different across channels ,  like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information .  So , I was just I mean , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out .  Um ,  and so it 's a question of like what  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  OK .  I know .  Right .  No .  Yeah .  I mean as long as it can all be done automatically , I mean , then that 's not a concern .  You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem .  Um ,  so yeah .  As long as we 're at that point .  And I know exactly like what the steps will work what 's going on , in the editing process ,  so .  OK .  ",,
Bmr016.D,"And we already got the crash out of the way .  It did crash , so I feel much better , earlier .  OK , so um .  I did collect an agenda .  So I 'm gonna go first .  Mwa - ha - ha !  It shouldn't take too long .  Um , so we 're pretty much out of digits .  We 've gone once through the set .  Um , so the only thing I have to do  Yeah , that 's right .  so I I just have to go through them  and uh pick out the ones that have problems ,  and either correct them or have them re - read .  So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set .  I 've also extracted out about an hour 's worth .  We have about two hours worth .  I extracted out about an hour 's worth  which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms ,  have filled out speaker forms .  Not everyone 's filled out a speaker form .  So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms  and for meetings in which the "" key "" file and the transcript files are parsable .  Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand ,  and so they 're not automatically parsable  and I have to go back and fix those .  So what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with .  Um ,  Liz  Yep ,  yeah .  Yes , absolutely .  So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files  and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms .  I have this web - based speaker form ,  and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form ,  and they 're slowly s trickling in .  It 's for labeling the extracted audio files .  By speaker ID and microphone type .  No , I spoke with Jane about that  and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that  We edit out any of the errors anyway . Right ?  So the there are no errors in the digits ,  you 'll always read the string correctly .  So I can't imagine why anyone would care .  So the other topic with digits is uh ,  Liz would like to elicit different prosodics ,  and so we tried last week with them written out in English .  And it just didn't work at all  because no one grouped them together .  So it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else .  So in conversations with Liz and uh Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings .  The problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits .  When I look at this , that first line is "" sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . ""  Um , and so the question is does anyone care ?  Um , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine ,  as opposed to connected digits .  Um , I think two hours is probably fine for a test set ,  but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff .  Yeah , the the  Six dash one , you mean ?  Right .  Yep .  So we could just , uh , put in the instructions "" read them as digits "" .  How about "" O "" versus "" zero "" ?  Just let them read it how they read it .  OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits  not as connected numbers .  Right .  Oh yeah , absolutely ,  cognitively it 's much easier .  OK . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ?  Or is that alright ?  OK .  And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns  isn't that right , Liz ?  That we did .  Yep .  Right .  Right .  Right .  Right .  I think that uh trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile  because the recording situation is so different .  It 's gonna be very hard to be comparable .  Yeah I mean read versus not .  Well , and not just that ,  I mean the uh the corpus itself .  I mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list ,  and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff .  I mean if I remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that .  I thought so .  Was it read ?  Oh , I may well be .  I haven't ever listened to TI - digits .  So I don't really know how it compares .  But but regardless it 's gonna it 's hard to compare cross - corpus .  So .  And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly .  So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah all we have for some people is digits .  Oh , you 're not .  Oh I see .  Oh yeah that 's true , absolutely .  That would be interesting to see whether that helps .  Do you think that would help adapting on  Yeah .  ","Um , so we 're pretty much out of digits .  so I I just have to go through them  and uh pick out the ones that have problems ,  and either correct them or have them re - read .

Bmr016.D,"Yeah , I have a real problem with that .  Right .  Same same acoustics ,  same microphone ,  same channel .  OK .  Good .  Yeah , we talked about that a couple times .  The the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load .  No it 's it 's not stupid ,  it 's just I mean , try to do it .  I mean , here , let 's try it .  You read the last line , I 'll read the first line .  So so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line .  Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it ,  but then you don't get the the same effects .  Yeah .  Oh I see .  I guess we could try .  We could try doing some .  Well Well OK . Well let 's try it .  You do the last line , I 'll do the first line .  O . That 's not bad .  The poor transcribers  they 're gonna hate us .  A round .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session ,  something like that  rather than doing it during a real meeting  and you know , do two people at a time  then three people at a time and things like that .  So .  See see what Dan thinks .  Yeah , right .  I thought this was gonna be fast .  Oh well .  Not after I "" eight "" though .  Uh .  Nein !  You have to be German ,  yeah .  Oh !  I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like uh TIMIT .  Hmm .  OK , are we done with digits ?  Um ,  We have ASR results from Liz ,  transcript status from Jane ,  and disk space and storage formats from Don .  Does do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna we wanna go ?  Mm - hmm .  Um , why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list .  Oh it 's in the paper .  OK .  OK then , it 's already been mailed .  Horrible ?  And someone said "" oh "" in the front in the middle .  I noticed that Chuck was wearing the lapel a lot .  Probably how you wear it wore it I would guess .  Uh - huh .  Right .  And he said , "" Lots lots lots lots . ""  Well that 's with the hand stuff .  But how would you do that automatically ?  I mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do .  So .  Um ,  I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits ,  so I have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on .  So let 's do that off - line ,  we don't need to do it during the meeting .  And and I have scripts that will extract it out from "" key "" files  and and do all the naming automatically ,  so you don't have to do it by hand .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Yeah , names names in the names to I Ds ,  so you  and it does all sorts of matches  because the way people filled out names is different on every single file  so it does a very fuzzy sort of match .  Yep .  Yep .  So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan ,  and it will give you his ID .  So .  Um ,  alright .  Do we  Don , you had disk space and storage formats .  Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting ,  or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ?  Mm - hmm .  Entropy coding .  So .  And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ?  Probably , yeah .  That doesn't matter .  You can access it from anywhere in ICSI . N  N  Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood .  Um , so the the only question is how much of it  The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not .  So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate .  So ,  the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal  because disks don't crash very frequently ,  as long as you can regenerate it .  Then put it all on scratch  because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup .  So we wanna put  It just depends on your tools .  I mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded ,  so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything .  Yeah , as I said , since that 's it 's regeneratable , what I would do is take downsample it ,  and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in .  Right .  Yep .  And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions  is that you could run all the English speaking ,  all the native speakers ,  and all the non - native speakers ,  and all the men , and all the women .  Yeah .  "" That 's just not right , man . ""  The the point  So so s For example , what if you wanted to run run all the native speakers .

Bmr016.D,"Right , so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere ,  extracts out the language ,  finds the time - marks for that particular one ,  do it that way .  The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted  and it 's embedded in the file name .  And so , you know , you just say  y so you just say you know "" asterisk E asterisk dot wave "" , and you get what you want .  Rather than doing seeks through the file .  This is all just temporary access ,  so I don't I think it 's all just  It 's fine .  You know .  Fine to do it however is convenient .  Yeah and they don't .  Two gig ?  Yes you can .  I th  w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that  did they Jane ?  They loaded they loaded the long long files into X Waves .  Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ?  Because because i we used X Waves to do the digits .  And they were loading the full mixed files then ,  and it didn't seem to be any problem .  Hmm .  Seemed really fast .  Well regardless , it 's  and , it 's no problem , right ?  Because it 's not backed up .  So we just  If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive  and make it all scratch space .  You know , it 's not a big deal .

I 'm sure people can adapt to this ,  read it single .  The spaces already bias it toward being separated .  And I know I 'm gonna find this easier than words .  I think that i it 's fine .  I it it to me it looks like you 've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation  and , you know , it 's just a matter of u i the instructions , that 's all .  I did  Mm - hmm .  Go ahead .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I also would like to argue for that  cuz it it seems to me that , um , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times  and adding to that basic test bank .  Hmm ?  Cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors .  And I think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups ,  and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done ,  which were done by non - native speakers  so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set ,  which is totally American speakers ,  and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database .

Any other a difference ?  OK .  OK .  OK , fine .  OK .  Great .  I think it was numbers ,  but I 'm not sure .  You have to have a similar pace .  c c Can I can I have an another another question w about this ?  So , um , there are these digits ,  which are detached digits ,  but there are other words that contain the same general phon phoneme sequences .  Like "" wonderful "" has "" one "" in it  and and Victor Borge had a had a piece on this where he inflated the digits .  Well , I wonder if there 's , um , an if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of "" one "" in "" wonderful "" versus "" one "" as a digit being read .  There you go .  Nein .  Well , I mean , I just wanted to offer that as a possible task  because , you know , if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in sent in sentences  cuz it 's like an entire sketch he does  and I wouldn't take the inflated version .  So he talks about the woman being "" two - derful "" ,  and  and a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read .  I don't know if it would be useful for comparison ,  but it 's embedded numbers .  I see .  OK .  OK , thank you .  Huh .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm , very good point .  Mm - hmm .  What 's th u w in what respect ?  In the in  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . Yeah .  It was also true of the digits task which was X Waves .  Yeah .  Very quickly .  I agree .

Bmr016.E,"so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second  cuz we 're not ready for that .  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exactly ! Exactly !  Alright so , a spelling check first  then an exhaustive listing of the , uh all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached  and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas .  And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker .  And if not , then that gets checked .  Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called "" spoken - forms "" .  So there  mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription .  But there 's  w And that that 's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled .  So for things like "" and "" , the fact that someone doesn't say the "" D "" , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription  because a a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that .  However , things like "" cuz "" where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable ,  and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language ,  those are r reasons f for those reasons I I kept that separate ,  and used the convention of using "" CUZ "" for that form ,  however , glossing it  so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one ,  and a couple of others ,  not many .  So "" wanna "" is another one ,  "" going "" uh , "" gonna "" is another one ,  with just the assumption , again , that this th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider expect that a pronunciation model , to handle .  And Chuck , you in you indicated that "" cuz "" is is one of those that 's handled in a different way also , didn't you ?  Did I  OK .  So so it might not have been It might not have been you ,  but someone told me that in fact "" cuz "" is treated differently in , um , i u in this context  because of that r reason that , um , it 's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant .  OK , so after that ,  let 's see ,  um .  Well so when I get the exhau  So the spell - check picks up those words  because they 're not in the dictionary .  So it gets "" cuz "" and "" wanna "" and that  Yeah , mm - hmm .  Run it through  I have a sed You know , so I do sed script saying whenever you see "" gonna "" you know , "" convert it to gonna "" , you know , "" gloss equals quote going - to quote "" ,  you know .  And with all these things being in curly brackets  so they 're always distinctive .  OK , I also wrote a script which will , um , retrieve anything in curly brackets , or anything which I 've classified as an acronym ,  and a pronounced acronym .  And the way I tag ac pronounced acronyms is that I have underscores between the components .  So if it 's "" ACL "" then it 's "" A "" underscore "" C "" underscore "" L "" .  And the th  Yes . Uh - huh , yeah .  OK , so now . Uh and a  Yeah .  Yes , but not the reverse .  So sometimes people will say "" because "" in the meeting ,  and if if they actually said "" because "" , then it 's written as "" because "" with no w  "" cuz "" doesn't even figure into the equation .  Yeah .  That 's a good point .  That 's fine .  Well Don has a script .  Exactly .  Uh - huh .  And Don knows this ,  and he 's bee he has a glo he has a script that  Yes . And that 's why there 're different tags on the glosses ,  on the different on the different types of comments ,  which we 'll which we 'll see in just a second .  So the pronounceable acronyms get underscores ,  the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments .  There 're comments of four types .  So this is a good time to introduce that .  The four types .  w And maybe we 'll expand that  but the but the comments are , um , of four types mainly right now .  One of them is , um , the gloss type we just mentioned .  Another type is , um  I 'm still doing the overview .  I haven't actually gotten here yet .  OK so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , um , more abbreviated one to the left .  Uh , then you have if it 's uh , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words ,  and wo some of them are laughs and breathes ,  so we have uh that 's prepended with a v a tag of "" VOC "" .  And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings ,  and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization .  Oh yeah , so i e this would  Let 's just take one example .  And then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam .  They always end .  So it 's like they 're paired curly brackets .  ","And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker .  Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called "" spoken - forms "" .  mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription .

Uh , then you have if it 's uh , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words ,  ",
Bmr016.E,"And then the third type right now , uh , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening .  So it could be something like , you know , "" referring to so - and - so "" ,  "" talking about such - and - such "" ,  uh , you know , "" looking at so - and - so "" .  Yeah .  Yeah , and this gets substituted here .  Huh - uh .  No , they 're events .  They 're actually They have the status of events .  Well , and actually , um , it is true that , with respect to "" laugh "" , there 's another one  which is "" while laughing "" ,  and that is , uh , i i An argument could be made for this tur turning that into a qualitative statement  because it 's talking about the thing that preceded it ,  but at present we haven't been , um , uh , coding the exact scope of laughing , you know ,  and so to have "" while laughing "" , you know that it happened somewhere in there  which could well mean that it occurred separately and following ,  or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left .  Haven't been awfully precise about that ,  but I have here ,  now we 're about to get to the to this now ,  I have frequencies .  So you 'll see how often these different things occur .  But , um , uh , the very front page deals with this , uh , final c pa uh , uh , aspect of the standardization  which has to do with the spoken forms like "" mm - hmm "" and "" mm - hmm "" and "" ha "" and "" uh - uh "" and all these different types .  And , um , uh , someone pointed out to me ,  this might have been Chuck , about , um about how a recognizer , if it 's looking for "" mm - hmmm "" with three M 's , and it 's transcribed with two M 's , that it might uh , that it might increase the error rate  which is which would really be a shame  because um , I p I personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items .  So , right now I 've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms .  I I should say  all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today .  So , I 'm gonna I 'm gonna I 'm gonna check  Yeah , yeah .  Acsu - actually yeah .  I got It was stored in a place I didn't expect ,  so and and um ,  w we , uh , sh yea reconstructed how that happened .  And this is this 'll be great .  So I 'll I 'll be able to get through that tonight ,  and then everyth i well , actually later today probably .  And so then we 'll have everything following these conventions .  But you notice it 's really rather a small set of these kinds of things .  And I made it so that these are , um , with a couple exceptions but , things that you wouldn't find in the spell - checker  so that they 'll show up really easily .  And , um  Sure .  Well , yeah . Now that that s only occurs once ,  and I 'm thinking of changing that .  So - c I haven't listened to it  so I don't know .  I haven't heard it actually .  I n I need to listen to that one .  Did she hear the th did she actually hear it ?  Cuz I haven't heard it .  Yeah .  Yeah I 'm curious to se hear what it is ,  but I didn't know wanna change it to something else until I knew .  Well , sss , you know  Hhh .  Yeah .  That 's right .  OK .  Yeah , that 's right .  That 's right .  Yeah .  Uh ,  so .  That 's partly a nonnative - native thing ,  but I have found "" EH "" in native speakers too .  But it 's mostly non - native  Eh .  Mm - hmm .  That 's right .  Exactly .  "" UH "" .  Mm - hmm , that 's right .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Well , we 're not doing We 're not doing length .  Yeah , that 's right .  This makes sense .  Yeah I I think you 've  uh - huh , yeah .  That makes sense .  Yeah , and so , you know , I mean , th th I have there are some , um , Americans who who are using this "" eh "" too ,  and I haven't listened to it systematically ,  maybe with some of them , uh , they 'd end up being "" uh 's ""  but , uh , I my spot - checking has made me think that we do have "" eh "" in also , um , American e e data represented here .  But  any case , that 's the this is reduced down from really quite a long a much longer list ,  and this is  functionally pretty , you know , also  It was fascinating , I was listening to some of these , uh , I guess two nights ago ,  and it 's just hilarious to liste to to do a search for the "" mm - hmm 's "" .  And you get "" mm - hmm ""  and diff everybody 's doing it .  Just I wanted to say I w think it would be fun to make a montage of it  ","And then the third type right now , uh , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening .  I have frequencies .  So you 'll see how often these different things occur .  But , um , uh , the very front page deals with this , uh , final c pa uh , uh , aspect of the standardization  which has to do with the spoken forms like "" mm - hmm "" and "" mm - hmm "" and "" ha "" and "" uh - uh "" and all these different types .  So , right now I 've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms .  ",
Bmr016.E,"because there 's a "" Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . ""  It 's really it 's really fun to listen to .  All these different vocal tracts , you know ,  but it 's it 's the same item .  It 's very interesting .  OK .  Uh , then the acronyms  y and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of ,  and I haven't been able to listen to to to clarify ,  but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them  cuz it 's the only place where where they 're used .  Question mark is punctuation .  So it they said that @ @  um , "" DC ? ""  Exactly .  Exactly .  Yeah , so the only  Well , and I do have a stress marker here .  Sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up ,  and , um  The parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was ANN , but wasn't entirely sure .  So I 'd need to go back or someone needs to go back , and say , you know , yes or no ,  and then get rid of the parentheses .  But the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts , of of noti noticing that there 's something uncertain .  I think that 's true .  Yeah , absolutely .  NSA ,  a lot of these are are coming from them .  I listened to some of that .  Yeah .  Yeah . I agree .  And Robustness has a fair amount ,  but the NSA group is just very very many .  Yeah .  That 's interesting .  Right and sometimes , I mean , you see a couple of these that are actually "" OK 's ""  so it 's it 's may be that they got to the point where I mean it was low enough understandable  understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said "" OK . ""  You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym ,  but just n needs to be double checked .  Now we get to the comments .  This  Number of times out of the entire database ,  w except for that last thirty minutes I haven't checked yet .  I 'd have to listen .  I I I agree .  I w I 'd like to standardize these down farther  but , um , uh ,  uh , to me that sounds equivalent .  But , I I 'm a little hesitant to to collapse across categories unless I actually listen to them .  Well , then , at least now .  Yeah .  Six .  OK well  But did you notice that there were seven hundred and eighty five instances of "" OK "" ?  And that 's just without the without punc punctuation .  Extra forty one if it 's questioned .  On the page two of acronyms .  Yeah .  Of "" OK "" , yes .  Mm - hmm .  So that 's the single existing convention for "" OK "" .  Yeah that 's  Yeah .  That 's that 's I looked for that one .  I actually explicitly looked for that one ,  and I think that , um ,  I I 'm not exactly sure about that .  No , I looked for that ,  but that doesn't actually exist .  And it may be ,  I don't I can't explain that .  I i it 's the only  it 's the only pattern that has a slash after it ,  and I think it 's it 's an epiphenomenon .  Yeah .  Oh that 's cute .  That 's funny .  Yeah .  OK .  There is th one  Y well , no , that 's r that 's legitimate .  So now , uh , comments , you can see they 're listed again ,  same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes .  Yeah .  "" TCL "" .  Where do you see that ?  Oh , oh .  The reason is because w it was said "" tickle "" .  Yep .  On the in the actual script in the actual transcript , I s I  So this this happens in the very first one .  I actually wrote it as "" tickle "" .  Because we they didn't say "" TCL "" , they said "" tickle "" .  And then , following that is "" QUAL TCL "" .  Qual - qualifier .  Comment .  Comment or contextual comment .  Mm - hmm .  Well , of course now the the Tannen corre the spelling c change .  Uh , that 's what gets I I picked those up in the frequency check .  Mm - hmm .  "" ICSI "" is is one of those that sometimes people pronounce and sometimes they say "" ICSI . ""  So , those that are l are listed in the acronyms , I actually know  they were said as letters .  The others , um , e those really do need to be listened to  cuz I haven't been able to go to all the IC ICSI things ,  and and until they 've been listened to they stay as "" ICSI "" .  It was !  In fact , it was !  Yeah !  He he s he said he said get  Yeah , that 's it .  Perfect .  Yeah that 's it .  That 's it .  Yeah , that 's that 's been changed .  That 's been changed .  So , exactly , that 's where the lengthening comment c came in .  s chan brought it down .  And those of course get get picked up in the frequency check  because you see "" beep ""  and you know I mean it gets kicked out in the spelling ,  ",Qual - qualifier .  Comment or contextual comment .  ,
Bmr016.E,"and it also gets kicked out in the , uh , freq frequency listing .  I have the there 're various things like "" breathe "" versus "" breath "" versus "" inhale "" and , hhh ,  you know , I don't know .  I I think they don't have any implications for anything else  so it 's like I 'm tempted to leave them for now  an and It 's easy enough to find them when they 're in curly brackets .  We can always get an exhaustive listing of these things and find them and change them .  Yeah , but I don't actually remember what it was .  But that was Eric did that .  Yeah .  I think maybe something like that .  Well , that 'd qualify .  Yeah .  OK .  Interesting question .  Yes .  OK , now first of all  Ooo - ooo !  Very important .  Uh Chuck Chuck led to a refinement here  which is to add "" NUMS "" if these are parts of the read numbers .  Now you already know i that I had , uh , in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers , I put "" numbers "" in place of any kind of numbers ,  but there are places where they ,  um , it th this convention came later  an and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers .  And , um ,  d  Chuck pointed out that this is read speech ,  and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob uh p uh , things .  And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now  which is just well n n "" NUMS "" by itself  which means this is part of the numbers task .  I may change it to "" digits "" .  I mean , i with the sed command you can really just change it however you want  because it 's systematically encoded , you know ?  Have to think about what 's the best for for the overall purposes ,  but in any case , um , "" numbers "" and "" NUMS "" are a part of this digits task thing .  Um , now th Then I have these numbers that have quotation marks around them .  Um , I didn't want to put them in as gloss comments  because then you get the substitution .  And actually , th um , the reason I b did it this way was because I initially started out with the other version ,  you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses ,  however sometimes people stumble over these numbers they 're saying .  So you say , "" Seve - seventy eight point two "" , or whatever .  And there 's no way of capturing that if you 're putting the numbers off to the side .  You can't have the seven and  The left is i  so example the very first one ,  it would be , spelled out in words , "" point five "" .  Only it 's spelled out in words .  So i this is also spelled out in in words .  "" Point five . ""  And then , in here , "" NUMS "" ,  so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss .  It comes out as "" NUMS quote dot five "" .  Thank you .  Well now  In that case it 's people saying things like "" one one one dash so - and - so ""  or they 're saying uh "" two I mean zero "" whatever .  And in that case , it 's part of the numbers task ,  and it 's not gonna be included in the read digits anyway ,  so I m in the uh  There is .  Yeah .  I 've added that all now too .  So , so gloss in the same line that would have "" gloss quote one one one dash one thirty "" , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , uh , "" curly bracket NUMS curly bracket "" .  So if you if you did a , uh , a "" grep minus V nums ""  and you get rid of anything that was read .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Good .  Yep .  This is more because  Yeah .  Oh these are all these , the "" NUMS point "" , this all where they 're saying "" point "" something or other .  And the other thing too is for readability of the transcript .  I mean if you 're trying to follow this while you 're reading it it 's really hard to read , you know  eh , "" so in the data column five has "" , you know , "" one point five compared to seventy nine point six "" ,  it 's like when you see the words it 's really hard to follow the argument .  And this is just really a a way of someone who would handle th the data in a more discourse - y way to be able to follow what 's being said .  So this is where Chuck 's , um , overall h architecture comes in ,  where we 're gonna have a master file of the channelized data .  Um , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses  and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer  an uh , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the for linguistics an and discourse analysis .  ","which means this is part of the numbers task .  Oh these are all these , the "" NUMS point "" , this all where they 're saying "" point "" something or other .

",
Bmr016.E,"And , um , the implication that that I have is that th the master copy will stay unchanged .  These will just be things that are generated ,  and  e by using scripts .  When things change then the the script will cham change  but the but there won't be stored copies of in different versions of things .  Except  Well  Well  Ex - exactly .  Exactly .  That was that was my motivation .  And i these can be changed , like I said .  You know , I mean , as I said I was considering changing it to "" digits "" .  And , it just i you know , it 's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is , and being sure the scripts know .  The other thing is you can get really so minute with these things  and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like "" percent "" .  Now I I could have adopted a similar convention for "" percent "" ,  but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ?  i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are  And we could always add it later .  Percent 's easy to detect .  Point however is is uh a word that has a couple different meanings .  And you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings ,  where he 's saying "" well the first point I wanna make is so - and - so ""  and he goes through four points ,  and also has all these decimals .  So .  Well I wanted to say also regarding the channelized data ,  that , um , Thilo requested , um , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins  wh like was Chuc - Chuck was mentioning earlier  that , um , that , um , if you if you said , "" Oh "" and it was in part of a really long , s complex , overlapping segment , that the same start and end times would be held for that one  as for the longer utterances ,  and  And he requested that there be , uh , similar , uh , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections .  He gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data  and found segments that would be useful .  And at this point , all four of the ones that he specified have been done .  In addition the I 've I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually .  So right now , um , I know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type ,  and I 'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they 've already started .  But if if you know , and I and he 's gonna give me some more sections that that he thinks would be useful for this purpose .  Because it 's true ,  I mean , if we could do the the more fine grained tuning of this , uh , using an algorithm , that would be so much more efficient .  And , um .  So this is gonna be useful to expand this .  You mean to start from scratch f in a brand new transcript ?  That 'd be excellent .  Yeah , that 'd be really great .  As it stands we 're still in the phase of sort of , um , cleaning up the existing data  getting things , uh , in i m more tight tightly time uh , aligned .  I also wanna tell um , I also wanted to r raise the issue that OK so , there 's this idea we 're gonna have this master copy of the transcript ,  it 's gonna be modified by scripts t into these two different functions .  And actually the master  Two two or more .  And that the master is gonna be the channelized version .  So right now we 've taken this i initial one , it was a single channel basically the way it was input .  And now , uh , thanks to the advances made in the interface , we can from now on use the channelized part ,  and , um , any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing .  But I wanted to get all the finished all the checks  Yes , they have .  Except for the missing thirty minutes .  Uh , for for a total of like twenty m  f for a total of  Let 's see , four times  total of about an thirty minutes .  That 's that 's been the case .  And plus the training , whatever you have .  Well , you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate .  And the reason they do that is sometimes there 's a word that 's cut off .  And so , i i i it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete .  And ,  so I it 's gonna be a more reliable thing  and I 'm not sure  Yeah .  Well partly it depends on how um , how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm  because i this takes time ,  you know , it takes a couple hours t to do , uh , ten minutes .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I mean  yeah .  But that  ","And , um , the implication that that I have is that th the master copy will stay unchanged .  that , um , Thilo requested , um , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins  And he requested that there be , uh , similar , uh , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections .

Bmr016.E,"Mm - hmm .  So that 's I I mean I could there were other checks that I did ,  but it 's I think that we 've unless you think there 's anything else , I think that I 've covered it .  OK .  Great .  ",,
Bmr016.F,"Yeah .  Will you get the door ,  and ?  OK .  You collected an agenda , huh ?  No there 's only ten .  Well , OK .  So you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have ?  And you think we th uh ,  I I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right ,  but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ?  OK .  So the relevance of the speaker form here , s  Oh , OK .  Wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something .  Yeah .  Yeah  Um , do um  you want different prosodics ,  so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ?  Is that correct ?  No but , I was asking if that was something you really cared about  because if it wasn't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't , uh , go and do numbers so much .  You know if it if it 's  Maybe some , but I probably not so much .  Right ?  So if you if if you have uh  if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one .  That 's what I was asking , yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  I mean , the other thing is we could just bag it  because it 's it 's  it 's - I 'm not worrying about it  I mean , because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from OGI .  I 'm sorry ,  digits numbers training that we have from OGI ,  we 've done lots and lots of studies with that .  And um .  Yeah .  No , no , I guess what I 'm saying is that  to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it  and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have .  Yeah .  We can go back to the other thing later .  I mean we s we we 've We can do this for awhile  and then go back to digits for awhile ,  or um .  Do yo I mean , do you want do you want this Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ?  How much of this do you need ?  with uh the  OK .  OK , well if you pre  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  Let 's try it .  So we have  Sorry ,  I I was just gonna say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now .  And you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits ,  so that 's roughly the ratio then ,  something like twenty twenty to one .  Which I guess makes makes sense .  So if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this .  Um , yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's OK .  It 'd be nice to get , you know , more later  because we 'll we might use use this up , uh , in some sense ,  but but uh  Yeah .  No it 's it 's not the same .  A little bit ,  but the other differences are so major .  They 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's uh  Well i i individual human glottis is going to be different for each one ,  you know , it 's just There 's so many things .  it 's it and and enunciation .  TI - digits was ?  I thought I thought it was read .  Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI .  Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But it but  It - it 's different people is the is the core thing .  And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth ,  so it 's it 's it 's really pretty different .  But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework ,  so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of uh frame of reference .  Uh , you know it 's not  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah I mean , for the for the um acoustic research ,  for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as as as the place that we start .  But , th I mean , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data ,  but but uh the truth is I 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , uh , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh , uh nearfield ,  and then um , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield ,  and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield .  So .  Let 's try it .  Sixty - one .  No , I 'll p  See , y  OK .  No , I can do it .  Alright , let 's try three at once you you pick one in the middle .  Go .  Oh like a round ,  ","but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ?  So the relevance of the speaker form here , s  I I was just gonna say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now .  And you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits ,  something like twenty twenty to one .  Um , yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's OK .  but but uh the truth is I 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , uh , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh , uh nearfield ,  and then um , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield ,  and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield .

Bmr016.F,"yeah , like in a a  yeah .  Row , row , row your boat .  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  I don't think we 're gonna collect vast amounts of data that way ,  but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with ,  yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Spend the whole time reading digits with different qu quantities .  That 's "" two "" bad .  Yeah .  Uh , they don't all work as well , do they ?  Hmm .  What does nine work in ?  Uh ,  Oh . In German ,  yeah .  That 's right !  I think everybody 's a little punchy here today .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Well I don't know .  Well I think the question is what the research is ,  so I mean , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here .  Yeah OK .  So if somebody wanted to do that , if they wanted to look at the the the difference of the uh phones in the digits in the context of a word versus uh the digits a a non - digit word versus in digit word , uh that would be a good thing to do ,  but I think someone would have to express interest in that .  I think , to  I mean if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance .  Yeah , so it 's the same thing ?  It 's the same thing I mailed to every everybody that w where it was ,  yeah .  Yeah , that 's that 's why I only used the part from use  which we had uh about uh about the alt over all the channels  or mixed channel  rather mixed signal .  Mm - hmm .  It just it just to r to remove cross - talk .  Yeah .

As yeah , as long as there is a a form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled , then ,  uuu  Yeah .  Then it 's fine .  But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on  we would like to  Yeah .  I mean it just depends how big the file is .  If the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks  but .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  So , @ @ .  But but in our meetings people don't say "" hey cuz how you doing ? ""  Yeah .

Bmr016.G,"Well , we actually figured out a way to  the the groupings are randomly generated .  I think they may still do it ,  um ,  And  I well OK I it might help ,  I would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping .  Um , so if that 's your question ,  but I mean it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits  if that 's what people want .  I I 'm  don't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits .  Um ,  and it seems like that might be better for you guys  since then you 'll have just more digit data ,  and that 's always a good thing .  It 's a little bit better for me too  because the digits are easier to recognize .  They 're better trained than the numbers .  Right . Right , read them as single digits ,  so sixty - one w is read as six one ,  and if people make a mistake we  But it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous  I mean for it 's  Right .  Well that 's fine with me as long as It 's just that I didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits .  So  OK .  OK .  It 's actually unclear right now .  I just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms , I thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups ,  and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits  since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gonna do better on those anyway ,  um , and it 's more predictable .  So we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber , in general .  But if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal  if the people say a hundred instead of "" one OO "" .  and also w maybe we can just let them choose "" zero "" versus "" O "" as they as they like  because even the same person c sometimes says "" O "" and sometimes says "" zero "" in different context ,  and that 's sort of interesting .  So I don't have a Specific need  cuz if I did I 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group ,  but If we can try it  Right , and you can give an example  like , you know , "" six sixty - one would be read as six one "" .  And I think people will get it .  Right , right .  It 's just easier to read .  Right .  OK  I also had a hard hard time with the words ,  but then we went back and forth on that .  OK , so let 's give that a try  and  I mean what do other people think  cuz you guys are reading them .  OK .  Great . OK .  Well let 's give it a try .  Righ - right , and you just they 're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits .  Right , just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line ,  and number of digits in a group ,  and the pattern of groupings .  Um , I I just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there ,  and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time .  And they can have ,  I mean , actually , things are getting longer and longer .  In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth .  So , there 's between , um  Well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups ,  and each one has between two and four groupings  and  I purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern .  So  Right .  But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits ,  whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , um , and compare that to their spontaneous speech ,  and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data  because you might be wearing a different microphone  and , I mean so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times .  Especially for speakers that don't talk a lot .  So um ,  for adaptation .  No , I 'm serious ,  so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation ,  and we 're not using the digit data now ,  but you know  Not for adaptation , nope .  v W we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on  and I 'd As soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech  and I thought "" well , we 're gonna do better on that ,  that 's not fair to use "" .  But , it might be fair to use the data for adaptation ,  so .  So those speakers who are very quiet , shy  r Right  Well , it sh I mean it 's the same micropho  see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting ,  and so you don't get  Right , and so I still like the idea of having some kind of digit data .  The only thing that we don't have ,  I know this sounds weird ,  and maybe it 's completely stupid ,  ","but I mean it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits  don't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits .  because the digits are easier to recognize .

Bmr016.G,"but we don't have any overlapping digits .  An - yea I know it 's weird ,  but um  Alright everybody 's laughing .  OK .  I 'm just talkin for the stuff that like Dan Ellis is gonna try ,  you know , cross - talk cancellation .  OK .  Wait oh it these are all the same forms .  OK So but  So you plu you plug your ears .  Well , what I mean is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically ,  but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people  and the beam - forming stuf  all the acoustic stuff that like Dan Ellis and and company want to do .  Digits are nice and well behaved ,  I mean  Anyway , it 's just a thought .  It it would go faster .  It would take one around amount of ti  That 's right .  I I mea I 'm I was sort of serious ,  but I really , I mean , I 'm I don't feel strongly enough that it 's a good idea ,  so .  A and that prosody was great , by the way .  It it sort of sounded like a duet , or something .  OK .  I 'm sorry .  I 'm mean I think it 's doable ,  I 'm just  So , we we could have a round like where you do two at a time ,  and then the next person picks up when the first guy 's done , or something .  Like a ,  what do you call it ?  Li - a r like  yeah , like that .  Then it would go like h twice as fast , or a third as fast .  Anyway , it 's just a thought .  I 'm actually sort of serious if it would help people do that kind o  but the people who wanna work on it we should talk to them .  So .  OK .  Yeah .  Can try it out .  If we have nothing if we have no agenda we could do it some week .  OK .  I 'm all "" four "" it .  Oh , oh !  Right , yeah .  Well I was actually gonna skip the ASR results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about  since I think that 's more important to moving forward ,  but I mean Morgan has this paper copy  and if people have questions ,  um , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of ASR results  because we didn't do anything fancy ,  but I think e just having the results there ,  and pointing out some main conclusions  like it 's not the speaking style that differs ,  it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors .  And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors ,  which you would expect  but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth ,  um , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of uh , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes .  So , that 's about the summary  But this is Morgan has this paper .  I mean he he  it it 's that paper .  Yeah , yeah .  So , we basically , um , did a lot of work on that  and it 's  Let 's see , th  I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad .  And it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech .  Yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time ,  um  but as we I mean I wanted to here more about the transcription .  If we can get the channel asynchronous or the  the closer t  that would be very interesting for us  because we  Right .  That 's  cuz  That 's right . In fact I I pulled out a couple classic examples in case you wanna u use them in your talk of  Chuck on the lapel ,  so Chuck wore the lapel three out of four times .  Um , yeah ,  and I wore the lapel once ,  and for me the lapel was OK .  I mean I still  and I don't know why .  I 'm  But um ,  for you it was  Or who was next to me or something like that .  Right , but when Chuck wore the lapel and Morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances  where Chuck is saying a few things inside ,  and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well  and so the rec you know , there 're error rates  because of insertion  Insertions aren't bounded ,  so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate .  And that 's that 's where the problems come in .  So I this is sort of what we expected ,  but it 's nice to be able to to show it .  And also I just wanted to mention briefly that , um , uh Andreas and I called up Dan Ellis who 's still stuck in Switzerland ,  and we were gonna ask him if if there 're you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that .  Not that we were gonna do it ,  but we wanted to know what would need to be done .  And he We 've given him the data we have so far ,  so these sychronous cases where there are overlap .  ","but we don't have any overlapping digits .  but the people who wanna work on it we should talk to them .  um , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of ASR results  like it 's not the speaking style that differs ,  it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors .

Bmr016.G,"And he 's gonna look into trying to run some things that are out there  and see how well it can do  because right now we 're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper ,  like a Eurospeech paper ,  because it would look sort of premature .  Right . Or who 's At any point in time who 's the foreground speaker ,  who 's the background speaker .  So .  So there 's like  Well ther there 's  Yeah .  Yeah . Exactly , so it 's it 's a  Um , it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation  which I don't know enough about to talk about .  Um .  But ,  right , um , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do ,  but using um , you know , more than energy  I I don't know what exactly would go into it .  So the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting .  and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak  Right . Except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues , um , that you can use to do that .  So .  And I guess Espen ?  This is uh is he here too ?  May also be working  So it would just be ver  that 's really the next step  because we can't do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem  um , until we can do that kind of processing .  And so , once we have some some of yours ,  and @ @ we 'll move on .  OK .  Oh right .  Yeah .  Right .  Definitely  Uh , and Don should  OK .  Great .  So that that 's it for the  Speakers and  OK .  Great .  Right .  So at this point we can sort of finalize the naming , and so forth ,  and we 're gonna basically re rewrite out these waveforms that we did  because as you notice in the paper your "" M O  in one meeting  and "" M O - two "" in another meeting and it 's we just need to standardize the  um ,  no it 's it 's  um , that 's why those comments are s are in there .  So  Right .  OK .  Great , great .  Terrific .  Eigh - eighteen .  It was a spare that Dave had around  Yeah it 's  Well the  Yeah .  Well I 'd leave all the All the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up ,  but all the waveform Sound files should not be backed up ,  the ones that you write out .  We can downsample them ,  so .  Yeah .  Yeah , we get the same performance .  I mean the r the front - end on the SRI recognizer just downsamples them on the fly ,  so  So that 's  Yeah , if  fe  You 'd you wanna not .  OK .  So we 're what we 're doing is we 're writing out  I mean , this is just a question .  We 're writing out these individual segments , that wherever there 's a time boundary from Thilo , or or Jane 's transcribers , you know , we we chop it there .  And the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer ,  and throw out ones that we 're not using and so forth .  And those are the ones that we 're storing .  So  Yeah .  Yeah .  So we can't shorten them ,  but we can downsample them .  So .  Oh yeah th  Yeah . Yeah .  That that 's why we need more disk space  cuz we 're basically duplicating the originals , um  Oh yeah .  No . We always have the original long ones .  Um , it 's better if they 're chopped out ,  and and it it will be  yeah , y we could probably write something to do that ,  but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out  cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders .  You c you can actually move them around .  Uh , you can get rid of  Yeah , it it 's a lot faster .  Right . You can grab everything with the word "" the "" in it ,  and it 's  That 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time ,  find the time boundaries and  So in principle , yeah , you could do that ,  but it 's  but it 's um  These are long These are long  You know .  This is an hour of speech .  We - yeah that 's so that 's part of it  is  Right .  And the other part is just that once they 're written out it it is a lot faster to to process them .  So .  Otherwise , you 're just accessing  Right .  Right .  The other thing is that , believe it or not I mean , we have some  So we 're also looking at these in Waves like for the alignments and so forth .  You can't load an hour of speech into X Waves .  You need to s have these small files ,  and in fact , even for the Transcriber program Um  Yeah , if you try to load s really long waveform into X Waves , you 'll be waiting there for  Oh  Loading the long  It takes a very long ti  Right .

Actually we we gave this to our pronunciation person ,  she 's like , "" I don't know what that is either "" .  So .  No , we just gave her a list of words that , you know , weren't in our dictionary  and so of course it picked up stuff like this ,  and she just didn't listen  so she didn't know .  We just we 're waiting on that just to do the alignments .  Maybe it 's "" argh "" ?  Yeah .  Right , no one say  Ah .  But it has a different prosody .  So , Jane , what 's the d  I have one question about the the "" EH "" versus like the "" AH "" and the "" UH "" .  OK .  S OK .  "" Eh , "" yeah right ,  cuz there were were some speakers that did definite "" eh 's ""  but right now we  So , it it 's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real "" eh "" and the one that 's just like "" uh "" or transcribed "" aaa ""  cuz in like in Switchboard , you would see e all of these forms ,  but they all were like "" uh "" .  No , no , I mean like the the "" UH "" ,  or the "" UH "" , "" EH "" , "" AH "" were all the same .  And then , we have this additional non - native version of uh , like "" eeh "" .  Right .

What I meant is that there should be a pronunciation "" tickle "" for TCL as a word .  And that word in the in , you know , it stays in the language model wherever it was .

So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue ,  but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date .

Cuz I was doing the "" grep minus V "" quick and dirty  and looked like that was working OK ,  but  Great .  Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the "" NUMS "" on it ?  Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ?  Or  These are all like inside the spontaneous  Oh OK .  I see .  OK .  So , I guess I 'd have one request here  which is just , um , maybe to make it more robust ,  th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of "" NUMS "" where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech .  Um , that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we don't see the "" point five "" ,  or or it 's not there , then we  a Just an And actually for things like "" seven eighths "" , or  people do fractions too I guess ,  you maybe you want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that ,  or  As long as they 're sep as they 're different strings that we that 'll make our p sort of processing more robust .  Cuz we really will get rid of everything that has the "" NUMS "" string in it .  Yeah .  It would probably be safer , if you 're willing , to have a separate tag  just because um , then we know for sure .  And we can also do counts on them without having to do the processing .  But you 're right ,  we could do it this way ,  it it should work .  Um ,  but it it 's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference  because one 's in the context of a you know , a transcribed word string ,  and  So  "" Seven point five "" .  The word .  Yeah .  And and actually , you know the language  it 's the same point , actually ,  the the p you know , the word "" to "" and the word y th "" going to "" and "" to go to ""  those are two different "" to 's ""  and so there 's no distinction there .  It 's just just the word "" point "" has  Yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version  even if even if it 's  A actually even like the word "" read "" and "" read ""  Those are two different words .  They 're spelled the same way , right ?  And they 're still gonna be transcribed as READ .  So ,  yeah , I I like the idea of having this in there ,  I just I was a little bit worried that , um , the tag for removing the read speech  because i What if we have like "" read letters ""  or , I don't know ,  like "" read something ""  like "" read ""  yeah , basically .  But other than that I it sounds great .  But that that 's not hard .  I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription  So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts ,  but if you split inside something , you don't where the word which words moved .  And that 's wh that 's where it becomes a little bit uh , having to rerun the processing .  The cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial .  Right .  ","but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date .  Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the "" NUMS "" on it ?  So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts ,  but if you split inside something , you don't where the word which words moved .  The cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial .  ",
Bmr021.A,"We 're on .  So , I think we pre - crashed ,  so I think we 're OK .  So it should be a really short meeting , I hope .  Uh , agenda items , number one , I wanna talk since we were just discussing that is microphone issues .  What the heck are we gonna do about microphones ?  So uh I got passed on that the EDU group doesn't like the uh , Crown mikes .  I do .  I l I think I find them very comfortable .  Uh , but it seems to depend on your head shape .  That 's right .  Yep .  Um ,  Right .  So apparently they they like  It has one good effect , that people are trying to get there early  because the people who get there early get to pick the mike .  People who show up late have to use these .  So , um , we should probably get different mikes .  So the question is , the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more , um , Sony mikes .  Just two more of those ,  um . And that that 's easy  and that will certainly work .  The other option is to try yet another mike .  Find one we like and potentially get six , all the same .  Um , these are better , if they 're worn correctly .  Yeah . Yeah , definitely .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So , I mean , they 're not a lot better ,  but they are a little better .  Um , they 're more directional ,  a little better error uh , noise cancellation ,  and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth , like this ,  whereas that one , to avoid breath noise , you really have to put it at to the side .  So you seem to get better signal with this one .  I don't know ,  but you know , in in sort of random polling  I mean , so s  Well , I mean , that 's the other option , is that we could switch the form so it 's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike ,  um , and then get duplicates .  I mean , there 's no problem with that .  It 's just what Should we get just more Sony ones ?  I hate the Sony ones .  b the one you 're wearing .  Because it it pinches pinches the temples too much .  I mean , so , if you wear it sort of around the back , it 's not too bad .  But I  Right .  Right .  So , I mean , we could try another mike .  But then we have the wiring issue ,  and So I I don't know what to do . What do  what do people think ?  The plug is proprietary .  So that 's why I was saying getting more Sony ones is trivial ,  because we can just go out and buy them .  Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired .  Yes .  So , the only possibilities from Sony are that one and the lapel mike .  So this isn't Sony .  This is Crown .  The one we 're wearing .  And so we had these wired for us .  And so  I think that 's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately , and have them available .  Right . And just make sure that you write down "" Crown "" or "" Sony "" on the mike number ,  which I 'll change to mike type , or something like that .  Yep .  Well , it 'll be me  It 'll be whoever 's setting up the meeting ,  who fills out the key file ,  so  It has the same potential for error as everything else .  No , no , we definitely would not have the user fill it out .  It would be me , Chuck , or Liz , depending on which meeting it is .  OK , so we 'll de definitely go ahead and do that .  Couple hundred .  Yeah .  It depends on how good the mike is .  Well the Crown ones were like two - fifty .  I think those are like one - ninety .  But .  Yeah right .  No .  Yeah , good mikes are expensive .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , eighty or ninety for the Shures .  So .  I mean , the Sony ones are expensive  because they 're proprietary ,  so they can charge whatever they want .  These are expensive  because they 're quite high quality .  So .  So we should buzz that out if we send the data to Sony .  Well , I 'm just joking .  So , you do not have to bleep that out .  I don't mind if Sony knows my opinion .  So .  Um .  Also , we 're pro I wanna double check with Morgan ,  he did say yes before I went to Japan on buying another wireless system  so that we can go all wireless , instead of the mix of wired and wireless .  And I think that 's the right thing to do .  And I 'm  Yep .  Yep .  Four more wireless .  Um .  And also I 'm gonna re probably replace the Andrea mike with a Shure ,  but I 'll test it , uh , sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works ,  cuz I have an extra Shure in my office .  Yeah , apparently it 's had some problems .  Yeah . It 's uh  This one .  In the meantime , right ,  ",,
Bmr021.A,"because uh it 'll it 'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway .  So  Oh really ?  Yeah .  I guess cuz everyone 's been out of town .  Probably over the summer it 'll be the same  cuz it tends to be less , fewer people .  Um ,  File  Uh , done with microphone issues , I think ?  If you want .  And this way we can get a door - slam in the uh in the transcript file .  Oh well .  No - not quite a slam .  Uh , the door - slam phone ?  And then we could have the phone phone ,  for for when the phone rings .  Um ,  Uh , file reorganization .  This is something we were talking about before I left  and saying we should probably wait until after I 'm back ,  and now I 'm back ,  so , we should do that at some point .  So we should get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else .  Sure .  Mm - hmm .  Shorten .  Is that the same as shorten ?  Well , OK , you mean it 's built into the SRI ,  because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools .  So .  So it 's just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools .  Oh really ?  I didn't know that .  Well , that 's not a sound tool ,  right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Shortening everything on the fly .  You had another process running that was shortening it .  Yep .  Did you have to re - nice one of the processes to make sure that "" shorten "" ?  Watching the disk meter .  The list ,  yep .  Start end .  Yep , the way Feacalc calc does it .  It would be easy .  It wouldn't be hard at all .  Someone just needs to d sit down and do it who has some time .  And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around .  About the only difficulty with that is if it 's compressed . Then you really do have to decompress it first .  Right ?  Because the pointers are  Y you don't know how much it 's comp  It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount .  And yeah I mean , that it  Well , I mean , it just depends on how much disk space is a problem .  I mean the what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place  and then operate on it and then delete it .  But .  That 's true .  Yeah .  Well , it seems like just shortening them is a good short - term solution  so we don't have to do any coding .  So .  No , it was I was still here .  It was the day I left .  No if I if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right after I left .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I think there was something else going on ,  because uh Dave Johnson said that DD was getting accessed frequently .  And it shouldn't be .  Right ?  That data never gets touched ,  because we write it once and then we never touch it again .  The wave files .  I mean , he was saying gigabytes .  And so , it has to be the wave files .  Yeah , so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet ,  but we should definitely double check on it .  Every night .  So at any rate , so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we 're gonna do and then when we 're gonna do it .  So I 'm not sure who isn't involved with that .  I mean , certainly me , Chuck and Jane .  Anyone else care ?  Right .  So , maybe we should do that  not during this meeting but s another time ,  and just get a list of everything we 're gonna do .  OK .  So just update all the naming conventions  and put all the files where they really belong , on one disk ,  and then leave leave everything in place until the back - up until the next full back - up  and then delete the old ones .  So .  Well , both need to be reorganized .  So um ,  various paths , th  I mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way ,  because um  Yes , exactly .  That too .  So that 's what I was saying . We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do .  And so  I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out ,  so I assume that 's alright with everyone .  Oh .  And  OK . Then I should have made that as an agenda item .  Right .  Well , I mean , how you choose to do it the naming is up to you .  So .  Yep .  Right .  I Actually I was gonna do a global search - replace on all entries at at ICSI  to change MR to MRM at all places at ICSI .  Y you  Well , maybe I shouldn't say that on re record .  There was a typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone ,  one of our sponsors , did a global sear search and replace for between "" sponsor "" and their name .  And so , it it was saying , uh  Well , anyway ,  I won't  I 'm not sure whether that 's right .  Yeah , one can imagine the problems that that would engender .  So .  Right .  Um ,  ",,
Bmr021.A,"Thilo , you had you wanted to talk about the  So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place .  So that it 'll work on all the NT machines .  Right .  So I assume Tcl - TK wasn't already on the machine , so you had to install it .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So , w what features did you use ?  So not RASTA ,  just PLP .  Huh .  Who cares ?  No , just would be a sign change .  How many iterations ?  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Hmm .  So this is just combination at the utterance level .  Why do you think the ICSI front - end is so much worse ?  That seems really odd to me .  Oh right . Right , right , right .  Ca - can you run the SRI Just as an experiment , run the SRI front - end without vocal tract norma normalization , and see how much difference it makes ?  If we could figure out how .  Yeah , but the  They won't  they don't correspond one - to - one though .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Hmm .  Right .  It gets pretty big .  And m my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better .  So .  For for whatever that 's worth .  Oh yeah .  Yeah .  So w  Yep .  It was mostly MSG , PLP , RASTA .  So , you know , the feature sets we had available .  And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level .  You know , so we 'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities .  Yep .  You 'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards so that they 're uh orthogonal .  So you 'd wanna do a linear transform also .  Yep .  Vocal tract thing ,  yeah .  I was thinking about tandem system  Well , let 's not talk about it here ,  but I had some thoughts about the tandem system .  OK , should we do digits ?  Do we have any other topics ?  OK , let 's do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time .  Why don't we let Don go first before his battery dies ?  You can really tell from the prosody where it goes .  After digits ,  I don't know .  Go ahead .  Mm - hmm .  Probably . We could probably build that in to the front - end .  I don't know ,  uh eh . Fff .  What would you like it to do when that happens ?  Well if an unblacked out channel is zero , is actually spitting out zeros , you can be pretty sure it 's off .  Because it doesn't spit out zeros ,  it spits out epsilons .  Right ?  Cuz there 's little background noise .  The question is , when the software detects it , what do you want it to do ?  I mean , it it it  We we already have visual feedback ,  right ?  You can see whether your mike is working or not .  Um .  Yep .  Turn off the screen saver during the meeting .  Yeah , I d I don't know what to do other than  There 's no sound out right now .  Yep . Yep . Yeah yeah . That would be good .  Well , we can think about what to do about it ,  but it It 's pretty clear we can detect it ,  so .  OK . Are we done ?  ",,
Bmr021.B,"Who does ?  I see .  They don't work for me very well .  I much prefer these .  OK .  L Liz Liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them .  They are ver  Right .  You know , pretty  Hmm .  Ah , come on .  Hmm .  Get a special phone for that .  Yeah .  No , we could add one .  Yeah .  Can I can I just mention something ?  Um , uh , I think the file regards reorganization . Also , um , another issue there is disk space probably ,  right ?  Um , so  I know that the files that you 've been cutting up for us f for the recognition experiments ,  uh , one way one really brain uh , brain - dead way of of of not causing any trouble , but saving disk space is to , uh , use the s the Sphere , the NIST , uh , W - encode program . to to encode , you know , to compress them .  Uh , yeah , but it does it s it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently .  Y uh , I guess ,  but it  um ,  Well , it 's It 's actually built into the Sphere library that NIST delivers ,  so  Right .  And actually , s the sound tools don't understand that . For the  At least Feacalc doesn't .  So .  But since since these files are made to be used with the SRI recognizer ,  uh and the SRI front - end uses the Sphere library which in turn does this transparently um , uh , that will be a quick and quick and easy way to just , uh , get you know , uh , be able to use more  But that 's gonna be only temporary .  I mean , you should do that too , probably ,  but but as you do that you can also just run the  well , actually , the th what you do is you run  Oh , now I have another use for the  The way I recently used it ,  and there might be better ways  So the program 's called W - encode .  And I think the type , y you say um I think dash T  and then there are different different encoding methods ,  but if you wanna use the shorten one , you say d "" minus T shorten "" ,  and then the old uh wavefile and the new wavefile ,  and then  Oops !  And then I check , you know , if this works ,  so , you can use the the shell "" AND "" operator or something .  Then I just move the new wavefile to the , you know , to the old wavefile ,  and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to decode it on the fly .  And that that just saved my butt  because I actually was running On a different experiment ,  I had segmented I was processing the whole Switchboard - two corpus ,  which is two hundred eighty hours of speech ,  and I was noticing , as I was almost finishing the processing , that I was running out of disk space .  And and so  I uh had this flash of inspiration of just  uh the same the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them ,  so I while this other thing was still going on , I was run I was running this this thing .  And low and behold I gained three g three gig of space  and um , you know  No , no . Actually it was fast enough .  This is very fast . This this really runs quickly .  And that 's  That was very suspenseful .  That was that was the most excitement I had all weekend .  Uh , uh boy ,  it uh came out just fine .  So .  Right , the the only reason we do this is because the the SRI front - end doesn't have a way to to um go into a l a longer file with indices .  Um , so I I suppose someone could try to put a hack like that into the  So .  But there 's also some  I guess  That 's true .  Exactly . Right right right right right .  I don't think so .  No , no . I mean , if you  Th - the the the  If you can operate on the full  If you don't have to segment it , then there would be less of a reason to do the compression ,  because you don't have that wasted that extra copy .  So .  Right .  Right .  I mean , the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions .  And if you have , you know , twenty channels and only five speakers , then it 's  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  No .  Uh , I don't know about the naming ,  I mean , Th - so these names that we 've been using so far are with  uh uh uh  I wouldn't just wanna change them you know , without some advance notice .  I mean , th that 's all these segment names that we we 've been using .  I would rather not mess with them until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently dealing with ,  so  Right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Oh great .  Actually someone I just got an email this week from someone as  To Anant ?  Oh , I 'm sorry ,  I I just  So , who did you talk to ?  Anant ?  Anant Venkataraman ?  OK .  Yeah , OK . Great .  ",,
Bmr021.B,"Yeah , OK .  Great . Great . Thanks . Thanks .  Yeah .  Cool .  Uh  Oh , well , yeah I I I actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it ,  because it has uh very little to do with with meeting recordings ,  but @ @ you know , I did uh run um some recognition experiments with ICSI front - end .  Um Uh ,  and and you know , this is the j joint work with Chuck ,  and uh , um .  So , first , uh , you know , we had we figured out sometime last week how to um  and and Chuck wrote this really nice little script Perl script that takes a uh waveform , runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the into um a f c so - called uh cepstra file ,  which is what the SRI system uses to read features .  It 's essentially uh uh NIST headered uh waveform .  You know , it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have feature vectors following the header .  And um that 's all done um by the script ,  and it works great .  And uh I first trained up two systems ,  because it 's gender - dep you know , the SRI system is gender - dependent  so to be comparable , I trained uh um on a sh on a so - called short training set  um a male system and a female system ,  and uh  also for debugging purposes , and for the heck of it , I trained um trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the SRI front - end from scratch ,  um , and compared the two  Well , we used , uh , twelve PLP uh , uh  Just PLP  and actually that uh , one of the questions I had was what the RASTA would possibly buy us .  But um , we 'll talk about that later .  So , the uh so the baseline system w the SRI system was uh used uh also uh uh used t twelve uh mel uh mel cepstra um based on a twenty - four filter bank um analysis .  Um  I do not know what  So the f the bandwidth of the um SRI front - end is from hundreds hertz to th th thirty - se  thirty - seven fifty or something like that .  And I do not know what the um ICSI um front - end would do .  I mean , what the bandwidth is .  Um ,  but the results are such that  uh , let 's see  Oh yeah .  So the SRI system also does um vocal tract length normalization  and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features .  So that 's one difference .  And the other difference is that in the , uh in the SRI system , the uh th the first the C - zero , the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest .  And what they do is they d they subtract the maximum  For each waveform segment they subtract the maximum of of th over that waveform segment from from the values of for that waveform .  Which is a kind of automatic gain control , that is localized  They subtract  Right , right , right .  Um , and then , after But after they done this waveform based normalization , they then do a conversation length normalization just like all the other features .  So it 's their kind of two stage normalization .  Um now , I understand that the common practice here has been to just do c standard uh mean subtraction , um on the waveform .  Um .  Right . But in what we 've done so far , because we didn't have any special provision for C - zero , we just treat it as as any of the other features ,  we 've done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side .  So um since both SRI and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C - zero that 's presumably , you know , someone has done some experiments to and found out that that works better .  Um , so that 's another difference ,  and that might account for some of the discrepancies in the results .  Um , but you know . So the the results are  um  Where should I start ?  Uh the  So there 's a two  Oh . I tried it with and without .  Uh .  So without and with adaptation .  For the adaptation ?  Well , y we always do three EM iterations to  and it 's it 's this it 's this quick and dirty  the phone loop adaptation which doesn't actually require prior recognition paths  and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation ,  but it gives you sort of a first idea of what you could gain with it .  And then , you know , so we have the the SRI front - end  and the ICSI front - end  and other than that the system configuration was identical .  So it was the same  They came up with um you know , same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster  Um , same The clustering used the same information loss threshold ,  which actually led to roughly the same number of Gaussians overall .  So that the system configuration is is comparable .  Um , and the Uh ,  so without adaptation ,  you had forty - nine p  This is error rate  in percent .  And with adaptation it 's forty - seven point one  and this this was fifty - two point six .  and fifty - one point three  and then , when I combined them  I can actually combine them with something like ROVER .  ",,
Bmr021.B,"It 's actually more sophisticated than ROVER  but it 's  Um , here I got forty - eight point five  and here I got forty - six point five .  Um .  At the utterance level , right .  Good question .  That 's fine .  Um , so , one percent I would attribute to the lack of VTL ,  about one percent .  OK .  And then maybe another up  I don't know how much the C - zero normalization business really matters  I can't it see , I mean can't see it the  I could . Yeah .  I could certainly do that . Yeah .  Um .  We could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the ICSI features .  That 's something we wanted to do  yeah .  We could I was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the MFCC 's and just try them with the ICSI uh front - end .  Because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um to the PLP c  uh Dan added the  So .  No , but they should be close , since this  I mean the  Anyway . But I can certainly try the SRI front - end without uh VTL .  That sh that 's that 's certainly quick to do .  Um and so  Yeah , and and then there 's all these  um  You know , the number of um  You know , this front - end u had a fair amount of experimentation going into it .  You know , how many filter banks do you use ,  what what bandwidth do you use , and stuff like that .  And uh we could play the same kind of games with the ICSI front - end .  Uh , actually , the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role .  We used to use a narrow bandwidth  and uh  uh that hurt us .  So this is , um And this is We 've now used roughly what everybody else is using .  So  um , there 's some room for improvements , I figure , in this in the ICSI front - end .  Um . So .  But the good news is that even with this with the ICSI system being that much worse , you still get a win out of combining the two .  So that gives some hope for the future .  Um .  Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation ,  so . Um .  Also interestingly the Um , the difference actually widens .  I would actually expect it or or hope that the adaptation reduces the difference  because it might um , for instance , um remove some of the  um  You know , som If you if you have some some difference in the front - end processing that uh is suboptimal , but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the um moving the models around .  But but apparently that doesn't doesn't really  actually the difference becomes larger ,  so .  Um . Anyway . So right now what I 'm doing is um  Uh well , there 's several things going on .  One is that Chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem the system on the tandem features .  So that would actually be the more interesting experiment .  Um , the other thing is I 'm training uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models  and then we can  And I actually want to do the system combination um with our eval system um , on some subset of the data at least ,  probably only for the males ,  because I don't have time to train both males and females ,  but um . Uh and um  It does get pretty big . Yeah .  Oh , you tried that on Broadcast News ?  Concatenating  different feature sets ?  Yeah .  Did you try uh  I see .  I see .  OK .  Alright .  Oh .  Yeah , and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors .  And that would blow up the  uh  Right .  Right .  Um so the  Yeah , and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the ICSI front - end to perform better .  Um . And and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can I can certainly run a SRI system without VTL  just uh to get  Wh  Yeah .  And that that 's quick to do .  So .  yeah  so but things are moving ahead ,  so  Digits . Sure .  Poetic reading of digits .  s meeting .  I actually have one more thing that  I don't know if it 's i if if it 's allowed to to bring up after the dis  Anyway .  But it might be important . For um  So Liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where it was later found that several of the s microphones were turned off ,  um  and this must become a problem especially with non - speech - meetings .  So um  is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from some of the channels ,  or ?  Because it you know it 's really annoying if you go through all that trouble  and then basically the meetings aren't useable  because uh even  I don't know what they do .  Maybe the batteries went dead ,  or th they just didn't they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the "" on "" position or whatever .  Well , no , if if you um  I mean obviously you always  I mean , there 's never gonna be a signal from all the channels ,  right ?  because  or rarely .  Um . But uh .  Right .  ",,
Bmr021.B,"Exactly .  That 's a good question .  I don't know .  But is there some We can collectively think of some of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of of just  Right .  Right .  So maybe it 's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal .  Yeah , something .  Oh yeah . That 's a good one .  Yeah .

Bmr021.C,"It 's probably the P Z  Yeah .  So do I .  Have you Have you listened to to them ?  Yeah ?  OK .  Those .  Yeah .  But the problem is again the the plug , or ?  Wh  OK . OK .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oops .  Student discount .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's causing problems ,  yeah .  The yeah a wired one .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Just silences ,  yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah , I had one one short point .  I have just installed a Transcriber version on one of our NT machines  so it 's available under Windows now .  Yeah I re responded to sh I have already responded to him .  I I don't know what what what he what the problem was .  It was really straightforward ,  really easy .  There was some some guy from SRI who wanted to to install  Yeah .  Yeah .  And he sent an email that he couldn't couldn't install it  and I I just described him , well , what I did  and it was really straightforward ,  so .  Yeah , it 's the Channeltrans ,  so the the things that Dave Gelbart  OK .  I 've  OK . Yeah . I could do that .  I had i to install it , yeah .  That 's error rate or recognition rate ?  OK .

Bmr021.D,"If you 're popular .  Yeah right .  Me too .  Th - those are intimidating .  Are they more directional ,  the microphones , as far as  OK .  Which ones are those ?  The one I 'm wearing ?  Oh .  Oh .  Yeah .  For one of these ?  God .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  The other thing I could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything to my eighteen gig disk , which is local .  Well , I mean , I don't know  Yeah , it is kind of a temporary solution .  To shorten everything .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  To be OK .  And segment on the fly .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  But I think kind of We 've had There was a big disk crash when you were gone  and  Oh was that the day you left ?  That 's suspicious .  Yeah .  Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes .  But , um  Yeah so , Chuck helped me out in , uh , r regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings  for like six meetings .  So I think they 're split up even further .  It 's kind of even more disorganized now  since we moved some of the meetings to different directories .  They 're on a different disk even ,  right ?  I think you didn't you expand them to XE on Abbott ?  No , you the ones that You the ones that you put them on when you put them on XE .  I think you put them on XE .  So .  Mmm .  Hmm .  Wow .  No .  Yeah .  Yeah , I 'm  Right .  Well ,  I mean , it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you 're doing  but ,  yeah , I kind of agree with Andreas ,  like I 'm a little bit  I looked at the naming conventions  and they look fine to me ,  but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be  No but I think just to be consistent we should also , I mean , have the same conventions , just in case you want  Yeah . Yeah . I mean , it 's only gonna affect my work .  So .  Yeah , it 's not gonna  I assume you 're not gonna go , like , into , you know , my directories and change my file names .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  that 'd be great .  Really enjoy that .  Right .  Hmm . Mmm , OK .  It it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording .  Oh .  Never mind .  Wow ,  that 's not a bad idea .  ",,
Bmr021.E,"One two three four five six I 'm on seven .  So you guys need to start going to the EDU meetings .  I prefer these ,  but I don't mind using those .  Those are better than the Sonys ?  Yeah , that 's why I was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in .  Well , it s It seems like right now if if u what they 're complaining are those ,  if we just got two more of these  Yeah .  And then they can just unplug those from the transmitter .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  How much is it just to buy the mike ?  Really .  Oh that 's way more than I thought .  I  yeah .  Wow !  Is there any educational discount ?  And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure ,  the SM - ten - A 's ,  and I think they were only like eighty bucks or something .  Yeah .  But they were they seemed pretty good .  Oh .  Right , right .  So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones ?  Cool .  The Andrea mike ?  Which one is the Andrea mike ?  A wired one ?  Well , if you 're gonna go to all wireless ,  Oh , you mean in the meantime .  Ah , I see .  Yeah .  I haven't In the meetings that I recorded s It 's always been at most six people ,  so I 've never had to  Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all .  Yeah .  There 's some knocks .  Mm - hmm .  You have a special phone ?  Oh , we could add one , yeah .  Well like  At least Feacalc doesn't .  Mm - hmm .  Wow !  You know what would be a  u I don't know if this would mess other things up ,  but It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around .  What would be easier would be like pointers .  You know , lists like "" original wavefile , start , end "" .  This is  Well , is there is there is there a NIST routine which can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices ?  Right . Right we I mean the original Switchboard files are not compressed ,  right ?  So we could leave those as they are .  Well , assuming you 'd Yeah . Assuming that you then off - load the original Switchboard files .  Yeah , yeah .  He did it on purpose .  Are they ?  I don't remember where I put them now .  OK .  Physical disk .  Yeah , after each meeting we copy the data to  Yeah , there was something weird about that .  Yeah like like the same meeting shortened , files that we pull off of Popcorn when we 're done doing the recording , looked , to the backup software , as if they had been written , you know , every single night , i for f you know , a week in a row ,  which is really weird .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Maybe n next week if we could .  I 'm trying to finish up some stuff .  That sounds like a good idea .  Mm - hmm .  I think we should also at the same time try to , uh , convert over to your new naming conventions .  That 'd be good .  Yeah .  I actually haven't looked at it yet . I haven't had a chance ,  so .  I mean , these  Well , if we  If we change things , it won't really affect what you 're doing ,  will it ?  Yeah . So you but you can switch that any time you want ,  right ?  I mean , if we  Everybody will use it .  Fine slash U slash star .  So Andreas , would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going ?  Uh  Just PLP .  Thirty - seven fifty .  There 's one other slight difference ,  right ?  Or two two differences .  Do they subtract the max from each i one or do they subtract each one from the max ?  Doesn't matter ?  Except you get a lot of negatives the other way .  Oh ! Oh !  For the C - zero .  Yeah , Dan added that in ,  but  What about ta concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one ?  Hmm .  Hmm .  What are people doing ,  they 're switching their mikes off or something ?  Test  Tell them to test their mikes , or  ",,
Bmr021.F,"Yeah .  Pre - crashed .  Oh .  I do .  Yeah , I do too .  Interesting .  I have a question about this .  Are the auditory quality Is it , uh , much different between this kind and the the fancy ones ?  They are .  OK .  The other thing is , is it just a few people who don't like them in the EDU group ?  Cuz  Gosh ,  cuz I much prefer them ,  I think they 're a whole lot , multiple levels , better .  It seems a shame t to discard discard them if if they 're better auditory quality and there 're only a few people who dis who object .  And  I hate it  because it 's hard to adjust the microphone .  I mean , I spend all this time fumbling around with it  and still not reasonable ,  yeah .  OK , n now may maybe I just don't know this  but , um , are the only two possibilities from Sony the two that we 've tried ?  Or is there another  I see . OK .  OK .  Oh , I see .  Isn't that something .  OK .  Oh . I see . OK .  Huh , I remember that now .  OK .  It might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too ,  cuz that would be an easy place for , uh , an error in the data .  For it to be forgotten .  OK , it 's just I 'm just thinking that if  it 'd be  yeah , but I know but I mean to have the user fill it out wouldn't be as reliable as have the  Good , OK .  Perfect .  Perfect , OK .  Is that more or less than you thought ?  Oh , OK .  We should keep a list of things we 're gonna bleep out and the conditions under which  It was over here sometimes .  Should we close the door ?  Oh , I 'm thinking I don't know about the acoustics .  That 's that 's all I was wondering about .  Yeah that 's right , we gotta get the obligatory door - slam .  I guess ,  right , the door - slam phone .  That 's an idea .  Wow , wow !  Wow .  That must have been suspenseful .  XF .  Oh , different ones ?  Well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was it w with a with a meta disk allocation , you had both c t transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on XE were on the same  sorry ,  different partitions of the same physical disk .  And it 's conceivable  I mean , I I don't  I mean , so um , I was told that it 's possible that that might have , uh , caused additional wear on it . Maybe caused it to to go bad sooner .  Oh . Uh - huh .  Well , why not ?  Oh sure it does .  Except that  Well , I mean , so the wavefiles , or or anything at all , because the transcripts are there as well .  Oh , gigabytes . I see .  Yeah , that 's right .  Yeah .  Is that right .  That 's very strange .  I didn't realize that .  OK .  And I and I 'd like , in terms of the conventions , to also , uh , you know , s send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it 's if there 's any get his input on it .  I don't think I don't think that 'll be  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah sure . I 'd like to  OK , now and you 're just you 're not talking about the s the X disks the X uh partitions ,  just the backed up space ,  or ?  OK .  OK .  I haven't either .  Sorry .  I will by next week , though .  You 're talking about different files .  This  With no with no advance warning .  OK .  Oh no , oh no .  Yeah ,  one one can imagine that that might be problematic .  But this this name change affects a subset ,  doesn't need to reflect everything ,  yeah .  Isn't that great ?  And this is not  Mm - hmm .  And this is not just the Transcriber ,  this is the Channeltrans ,  right ?  Yeah , excellent .  Excellent .  Well , I mean , as it stands , I I guess  yeah I see what you mean .  It 'll it 'll be on the on the UNIX side  but accessible through the H - drive .  Yeah .  Huh . Yeah .  Wi - without what ? Without VTL .  OK .  Do you wanna say that one again ?  That last one ?  Or did did you correct the whole one ?  Oh he did ?  Never mind .  OK good .  Alright .  So .  I think they sh  It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting .  Yeah .  ",,
Bmr022.A,"OK , here we go .  So  Definitely have to go to tea .  So  That too ,  but  Um So ,  only a couple of agenda items , since no one sent me email for agenda items .  Uh , the first is the IBM transcripts . I 'd like to uh , mention  I s I spoke with several of you about this ,  but just to brainstorm a little bit about what we can do with it .  So we got back the IBM transcript , and the accuracy looks OK .  There are I mean , there are areas which are clearly wrong  and there are a lot of areas where they put question marks , where the acoustics weren't very good .  And I think that 's fine . Putting it in question marks is better than doing it wrong .  The big problem was , they had the wrong number of beeps in it .  So it didn't align .  And that 's exactly what I was afraid of .  And I went in , and more or less by hand , corrected it , by loading it  I wrote a script that will convert it to the multi the Channeltrans format , looked at it in in Channeltrans and found the places where it got a unsynchronized ,  and then either  And in this case only only had to remove beeps ,  because that was th always the error , is that they put in it extraneous beeps .  But it 's not easy to do ,  because the whole thing gets offset ,  and basically , it 's assigning the wrong speaker to the text , and it all gets unaligned .  So it 's very difficult to do .  So it took me several hours just to do that .  Yep .  It took me a couple hours to write the scripts ,  and then it it probably took me maybe forty - five minutes , just going through it .  Now obviously it will be a lot faster from now on ,  because now I sort of understand how it works .  But , I think if we had some way uh some tool that made it easier to insert and delete beeps it would make it a lot easier .  Cuz one of the problems is that it takes a very long time when you make a change to load it back up in the channel transcriber .  And so there may be  I didn't just say that , no .  So th so this is the o the other approach which is , what do we do in the future , to try to make this less common ?  But it 's still gonna happen .  So  Yeah , we don't know what their process is .  So I had two ideas .  The first was to provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker I Ds .  You know , just "" male - female "" , "" English - nonEnglish "" , "" one two three four "" .  Um  And they just filled it in .  It was like a hundred twenty ,  and they had a hundred twenty - three or something like that .  Is that right ?  Well I I don't remember .  Yep .  Yep .  How would that help ?  Oh , you mean just break the one hour into a few chunks .  I 'm sure they would prefer it sort of one hour .  That I mean , just naming schemes will get  We can definitely do that .  So t so one question is , are there good places in the files where we can really do that ?  I mean , so so so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them .  They are played from the individual .  You mean , so , actually put put the wavefile in with beep in it .  And pu and have a beep model .  Yes , it would be , cuz it 's very , very regular .  Yeah .  You have to may add some jitter to it .  It 's just in this case they were not .  So I think uh , Chuck had a good explanation for it which I liked ,  which is these they 're listening to it and so they write something down , and let 's say they miss it , they rewind .  Well , they hear the beep again .  Was that that beep , or was that a different beep ?  So that 's why Chuck was suggesting different tones .  My original thought was , you could have a different tone for each speaker .  You know , there 's plenty of tone space .  And that might help cue the transcriptionist .  You know , give them a little cue about where they are .  What do you mean ?  That 's what I was saying . Is that that you could have each speaker could have their own tone .  And you know , since there are no more than , you know , ten speakers or so per meeting , there 's plenty of tone space .  Oh , OK .  Bo - eep be - oop .  Oh , oh , th oh , I see .  Well  Yep .  I mean , Chuck 's suggestion of just two beeps is nice  because then you could have them actually transcribe "" H - beep "" or "" L - beep "" ,  "" high beep "" or "" low beep "" .  It would be much easier .  Yep .  Yeah , we can ,  yeah , like , do do , uh , one for each ca one for each person in the meeting , you can only hire people who have perfect pitch ,  ",,
Bmr022.A,"and they can say "" A - flat "" "" B "" .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  So I think , certainly , doing two beeps is is no - brainer .  And then the other question is , if they can  If they do something on a computer in a format we can handle , we could give them a text file that was a template with speaker ID and beeps already in it .  And then they could just fill that in .  Right .  Well , as I said , I think We don't actually know ,  but I think Chuck 's hypothesis was a good one ,  which is , you re r you listen to something , you write down what you thought you heard , but you want to listen to it again , so you r rewind .  And then you hear the beep again , and then you say "" well , is that that beep ,  or is that a new beep ?  I don't remember . ""  And so , you know , a couple times they got it wrong .  Well , we could .  We could , but then that starts getting pretty long .  Well , they would have to have a mark .  Well , it 's sequential .  Right , you would go sequential . So unless you got pretty unlucky ,  what the person was saying and the number  So beep number .  Yeah the  It 's just getting pretty long .  You know , the utterances are very short .  And so you 're gonna be talking beep , number , "" yes ! "" beep , number , "" no "" .  And when they transcribe this meeting it 's gonna be really impossible .  Yeah , yep .  It 's not a bad idea .  That would help get them synchronized .  I think it would be ,  because they would know their place .  Yeah .  They would know their place , darn it !  Those transcriptionists need to know their place .  Yeah , the numbers are a good idea .  Othe - other than lengthening the transcript , I think it would be very helpful .  Yeah , you don't have to  you could keep them short by not s or just go one through ten , one through ten , one through ten , or one through twenty .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Yeah , single digit numbers  That also appeals to me . So that you don't have to , you know  "" One hundred twenty - four ""  "" Beep . One thousand three hundred forty - two ""  Mm - hmm .  I don't remember .  Chuck was saying there was more than that .  More beeps than that .  Was it that many ?  I just don't recall .  Yep .  Easy enough to figure out .  We have all that data .  Yeah , you 're right .  It had to have been more than that .  I mean , it was a forty - five minute meeting ,  so  And it certainly was not a minute a chunk ,  it was a few seconds a chunk .  So I 'm just mis - remembering .  I 'm just mis - remembering .  So .  It might make the transcript faster  W wel I mean I A quick conversation with Brian would be good ,  so .  OK .  And other than that  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yep .  Right . I mean , that 's what we want to avoid .  But that won't work  because it 's  Well , but , all we 'll get  Right , you you need But you need the text  to tell it where it got it wrong .  Yeah .  Because you have to know which ones match which .  And we can do that with wordcount .  Right ? We already know that that we 're three short .  And so if we just did spee uh beep and non - beep all you would get is that you have three mistakes ,  but you wouldn't tell you which ones were wrong .  You need some of the words in there , so that you can say "" well , this segment matches this one ,  this segment matches this one ,  and this one doesn't match at all ,  unless we insert a beep "" .  Well , actually , you know , there 's an even easier way .  We don't really need a beep model .  Um , just extract the segments and do a forced alignment ,  and if the score is good , then you say it matches  Right .  Well , the numbered ones would make it a lot easier ,  cuz you could then really localize where the error is .  Yep .  Yeah , I mean , we could certainly break the meetings  We could certainly break the meetings into pi pieces .  So , just  That 's true , yeah .  I think that was Chuck .  Yep .  Yeah , it does look good .  I mean , I found several errors ,  but they were not significant .  They were all things that I could easily listen to and sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other ,  so .  OK .  Um  We still haven't really sat down and talked about file reorganization ,  and directory reorganization .  So we still have to do that .  But I don't think we need to do that in this meeting .  But , uh It is something that needs to get done ,  and I wanna also coordinate it with Dave so that we do a level zero backup right after .  So we don't waste a lot of tapes .  But , uh  So let 's let 's try to do that sometime ,  OK ?  ch OK ?  Um  ",,
Bmr022.A,"We also still have to make a decision about mike issues ,  what we wanna do with that .  And just swap them in and out ?  Yeah , we could certainly do that .  So uh , Morgan , just to  uh , since you weren't at the meeting last week , uh , apparently a bunch of the EDU fe folks really hate this style mike .  I mean , that 's that 's that 's a fairly strong indication of dislike .  Um  The Crown .  So what I was thinking is , we could get a few more of the Sony ones  and just unplug them and plug them in .  And the only thing is that when you fill out the digit forms , you have to be sure to indicate which mike was actually used .  So , I mean , that 's easy to do .  Um  it it moves us away from this uniform , all the mikes are the same ,  which some people had said was a benefit .  But  It is . Yeah .  Yep .  I mean  th  We abs th  We have lots o of choices of microphones .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  I mean , so we can go microphone shopping , and get get more microphones .  It 's just w  I 'm just not sure what we should do .  Yep .  Well , I  I agree with that ,  and so my feeling is , we should get mikes that people like .  And so I my feeling is , going out and buying a few more mikes is fine .  So should I just go do that ?  OK .  And then also , should we go ahead and get another wireless system ?  You know , for whatever it 's gonna be , uh  Uh , no , actually , get we need another box .  Because each each box in the back room can only take six .  So we could  Yep .  OK .  So I 'll just go d I 'll do that .  Yep .  Yep .  OK . Then I will just go do that ,  and send the bill to uh ,  what 's - her - name . Whoever will pay .  You .  Yeah .  This it 's it 's a cell phone jack .  Th - d  Yep .  Except that one 's even bigger than most of the ones I 've seen .  Most of the ones are just a little boom .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . The the biggest issue is the stupid cable  that Sony  The connector that Sony has , that , uh  It 's non - standard ,  and so you can't just plug something in .  You need to get it wired .  Right .  Right .  I wonder if you could do an adaptor .  I don't know if you can or not .  An adaptor might be a better idea than do redoing the wiring all the time .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yep .  Demo .  Yep .  I mean , what I was envisioning was a PDA with a cellular link in it .  You know , with one of the r short - range wireless .  And let th Just do capture the audio on the PDA and send the audio over the wireless net .  But .  Uh , Bluetooth is shorter range ,  but you could use Bluetooth .  Wh - whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor .  I don't remember what it 's called .  OK , then uh , another issue on file reorganization is , uh , making data available to people outside ICSI .  So , specifically , the U W folks have been wanting to get access to it .  So I think the right thing to do for that , is figure out how to do CVS without uh , compromising security .  Some pass SSH tunneled CVS ,  and then give them access .  Yes , except that the command has to not take a password .  Because it it 's non - interactive .  And so the only way to do that is with , uh S - hosts ,  which is insecure .  So we still have to sort of look at it a little bit .  I mean , I 'm sure it 's been solved ,  and I just haven't found the solution yet .  But I am sure that people have done it  because it 's gonna be a problem a lot of people have .  But , um  Uh , n n not really ,  because then we have the coordination issue .  I mean , so one thing they could do  I mean , I guess that 's true .  They could simply log in to ICSI  and do everything locally .  Yeah , except they could share one .  The , uh the SSH accounts , and the user accounts don't have to be similar .  So .  I mean , there are lots of ways of doing it ,  but w but if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it , just letting them log in to ICSI might be OK .  So the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control .  And the audio files , it 's not worth doing  cuz they 're too big .  You 're never gonna be copying them around and making working copies of them .  And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of briefly is just general permission issues .  That right now , lots of people create the files  and then we have group "" Meeting Recorder "" .  But that means anyone in the Meeting Recorder group can overwrite the files .  And so that 's a pretty coarse level of granularity .  ",,
Bmr022.A,"So we might wanna think about doing a Meeting Recorder user owner for those files ,  and then doing group slightly differently .  But  I think what we have now  Another option is to m make a non make it owned by a not real user ,  and then root will be able to do it .  But root is pretty tightly controlled here .  So th I don't think that 's a good solution .  Yes , but if you do that , then someone who isn't the owner can't unchange it .  Yeah , as I said , it 's just a question of , uh , do you wanna have to track down root if you have to make any change .  You have security issues with that .  So .  No , with doctor - speech , it 's just a group .  So there 're lots of different owners of i i of the files , but the group is always doctor - speech .  Or real , usually .  Nnn  Oh , do you ?  Oh , OK .  I mean , I 'm not too worried ,  because the group 's pretty small .  But  Well , and just You , then , also just have the general problem of permission on the other files ,  that , do you want people checking out a transcript file when they find an error , and correcting it ,  or do they wa do you want it to go through you ?  OK , but that means that you 're gonna have to be available for people , all the time , who say "" there 's an error here "" ,  rather than just them just going in and correcting it .  Well , but You have a choice .  Either you let people do it themselves , or you don't .  Right .  Right , so you could get email .  Send email to Jane that someone has done a revision .  Well , so , you don't have to release it to the world until you 're ready to .  So the question is s w  So you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository .  Or just keep the lock on it .  Until you 're  Yep .  Cuz it 's not remote .  The nice thing about CVS is is , you can be on a different machine .  No , because UW wants to have access to these files .  That 's the whole point .  Well , if they k en if they record a meeting , and they create a "" key "" file , and they find an error in their "" key "" file , they shouldn't have to tell us about that  so that they can create correct an error in one of their files .  So that 's why I wanna do it  Different than what ?  Well  B  But , I mean , the meetings are gonna be the same way .  So UW records a meeting ,  we transcribe it .  A few months later they listen to it  and they say "" Ope ! They got that acronym wrong . ""  Why why sh  Mm - hmm .  The the p the point here is that it would be nice t for there to be one repository .  And if we don't let them modify their own data , they 're not gonna store their data in our repository .  Or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data .  I I 'm just looking at it the other way around .  So so let 's say we k  Ye - well , I don't see a real difference between RCS and any other system .  I mean , it 's just mechanisms .  The nice thing about CVS is that you can have multiple people modifying  and if the changes don't overlap each other , they can just do it .  So the problem with RCS is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they can't ,  because the granularity of locking is at the file level .  Uh , there 're lots of different policies for dealing with it .  So  At the repository level , there certainly is .  You can mark a file as as "" you can't check this out "" .  Yep .  Well , it 's it 's just like source code ,  right ?  So that , when you 're developing it and it 's really rough , you don't put it in the repository .  You wait to the point when you 're ready to release it ,  and then you put it in the repository  and if other people wanna Copy .  Mm - hmm .  I 'm just  Imagine that we reverse this  and they were keeping the repository and we were d collecting meetings and sending them to them .  If I found an error , and I sent them email and said "" here 's this error "" , and I didn't get a response for a couple weeks , I would stop sending them the my data  and I would start collecting it here  and we would end up with two corpora .  And I don't want that to happen .  So we have to make it convenient for them to make changes that they wanna make .  Mm - hmm .  Well  I just I don't s  I don't see that this is e  Yep .  Can you write "" unread "" on that ?  Yeah , thank you .  Probably not transcripts ,  but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the files .  And they 're certainly gonna wanna change tools .  And so you know , it 's the same as source code .  You you release source code at some point .  ",,
Bmr022.A,"And , either you have to do everything or you share responsibility .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  You can back everything out .  Right , but what I want to avoid is ending up with two corpora .  And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in , they 'll check it out once ,  they 'll make all the changes ,  they 'll never tell us about the changes ,  and we 'll get two different corpora .  Right ?  Nope .  Shall we do some digits ?  I wasn't planning on doing it simultaneously .  Oop ! Ouch !  ",,
Bmr022.B,"Uh , so uh , so I c I definitely have to leave at three - thirty today  for whatever . That 's  Yeah , they 're they 're having birthday cake and such  and so I can't miss that .

Can I I I just  How - how many how many beeps are there , and how many do we were they d were were off ?  Alright .  And is it a  Yeah , and it was a hundred - ish .  So so if you get one  uh , uh , excuse me .  If you get one off , it t everything is off cuz of the alignment  right ?  Uh , and this is all in one file that 's continuous .  So why don't you make it multiple files ?  Because then if they have one off , then then it would only screw up that file .  Yeah .  I mean , it seems now , if you just ha make one mistake then everything is off .  Yeah .  Yeah , just say , "" OK , is "" ten minutes is ""  I mean , maybe there 's other things to do that are more clever ,  but this just seemed to be the sort of the obvious thing  because , again , if you make one mistake , then everything after that mistake is off .  And , uh  Yeah .  Oh . Kind of low variance ,  wouldn't that be ?  You sort of might end up with some infinities there ,  but  Can I see that ?  Where 's the case ?  So is this a  seven or something ?  Or  What is it ?  M - one - hundred .  Or you could you could have ascending tones , or something .  Uh Or  No , I just thi I don't know . If you have a hundred or something just just sort of move them up i mu up a a half tone or something for for each one ,  and then  Oh was it ?  Oh .  See , I should listen .  Yeah ?  Uh , OK , yeah . So the only  That might work too .  Yeah , I was just thinking that actually temporally just , uh , uh , uh , an increasing tones so that  they would really have a sense of whether they were going , you know , forward or backward  or  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , it 's a thought .  Yeah .  Yeah , maybe .  That 's probably better ,  yeah .  S scratch my other idea .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Great idea ,  yeah .  No , two is probably better than what I was suggesting ,  because what I was suggesting , in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole thing , you 'd have to have the the tonal differences between the two kind of small ,  and actually you want them large .  So .  Yeah .  So what  Yeah .  I mean , what 's going wrong on the other end ?  What are they doing ?  What , uh  OK ,  s  Well , cuz they 're s distinguishing between twenty - three  that 's your indicator there , and twenty - three that somebody happens to say in a meeting .  But they might miss that ,  right ?  I think having a beep too is good .  W we 're saying "" beep "" . Yeah for instance .  But it sounds like a k a a a short conversation with Brian might be might be helpful to get a sense of what 's going on .  Well , th although  You 're saying i it 's it 's about an hour meeting ,  and there were a hundred and twenty - three  Hmm ?  Well , I was just wondering what the average length thing was .  Yeah .  Uh  So , right . So i  Well  Right , but my point was , you know , if It 's a big difference to me if there 's a thousand or there 's a hundred .  If there 's a thousand , then that means that this is only happening three times out of a thousand .  Which means , you know , even just splitting it up into a few files would probably take You know , nearly all the time ,  there would be no  W if it 's a hundred , then you know , that 's not the issue ,  but if it 's a hundred , then , the average length of each one is pretty pretty long  and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big deal .  So , that 's why I was curious .  Yeah .  Yeah , you 're still talking a forced al  Well , with the beep models , is what 's really you 'd have really g it would be really good though .  So  so it 's p so it 's really just doing , yeah , a keyword , like a spotting for beep with  OK .  Uh uh , again , especially if there 's hundred many hundreds or thousands I still think it would it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files .  Yeah . Cuz it , you know , it 's r r  I mean , you 've already broken them into chunks ,  so if you have if you have a th if you have a thousand chunks then make ten things of a hundred , or or you know .

Bmr022.B,"And then it will be , you know , this Eve - every now and then there 'll be a a beep missing .  Which one is these ?  The uh  Uh - huh .  You know , there are so many things about this that are non - uniform that I think having having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing ,  but you 're just not going to I mean we 've  uh  For instance , jus just the fact that people sit in different positions , different times ,  the exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time .  Uh  I I just don't  I mean , I think we we 're we 're getting rid of major differences  like we 're not using the lapel anymore , an and so forth .  But  the other stuff is just gonna some variability we 're gonna have to accept .  Uh - huh .  Yeah , see I I happen to like the old one better .  But  Yeah .  And some people do ,  but  You know . I mean , here 's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity .  We have something like forty - five hours of data collected .  And , uh , we 're also gonna be integrating in this corpus stuff that 's that 's being done at UW , uh , with entirely different microphones .  So I I think , you know , getting away from the lapel , having close - mounted mikes , having people adjust them as they 're most as as as comfortable as they can  I think that 's sort of the big deal .

Uh , because cuz we 've had With the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time , uh , we 've really had no tr no trouble with this at all ,  right ?

Whoever will pay ,  yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Do you mean the kind that hang from the ear , sort of thing ,  or the  Yeah , but I don't know that one .  So what 's that mean ?  Is this just this little  Oh they they have little headsets ?  Or what do they  Oh you 've you 've got one .  So where where does how do you wear that ?  What does that  Yeah , over the corner of the ear  Huh .  Yeah , that I 've seen .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But what  Why would it be cool ?  Oh , I 'm sorry .  You 're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the Sonys .  No ?  Well , some people will , yeah .  Yeah .  Well , I mean , another s  An - another side to that is that , um , in principle , uh , if it all comes together , supposedly we 're gonna get two um , IRAM boards .  Uh , little later on in the year .  And so , we 're gonna wanna be thinking in terms of some wireless connection to it .  Um ,  so we have , you know , some kind of little something ,  and , uh , we have a wireless connection , this board , that 's doing the computation for the f the , uh the recognition .  And so , you know , we wanna be able to show off to somebody ,  you know , we have a base station somewhere ,  and you 're wandering around , uh , hands free ,  and  No , no , what I 'm saying is that we 're gonna have to put together some kind of a little superstructure , d some sort of demo box that it that doesn't do a whole lot ,  but it somehow connects to uh , remotely to this IRAM board  which will be doing the real computation .  In other words , we 're we 're not gonna attempt to build , uh , it do the real work of building a portable device that 's little , that is doing all the computation we wanna do for the recognition and the far - field mike , uh , compensation and all that stuff .  So we 're gonna do all that on this powerful board ,  and , uh , have some wireless connection to it .  And then the question is what is what does it look like ,  does it look like something that you you hold like this ,  or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm at arm 's length th so that you can see some display ,  or , uh ,  do we have one of these  You know . I don't know .  So , it th these are all possibilities .  Yeah . So , is is Bluetooth the sort of thing that 'd be , uh  Hmm .  Who Well , we 're s talking about a fairly limited group ,  are are is it a small enough group that they would could just have accounts ?  Does that solve anything ?  Yeah .  Well , but that 's not  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah  What - what does CVS do if they if they do overlap ?  Oh , I  OK .  Hmm .  Gotta go .  ",,
Bmr022.C,"You 're a May birthday ,  right ?  Barbara told me .  Barbara Peskin .  And this is the mixed signal ?  Well , the other thing You can  The other thing you can do  This is on the mixed signal ,  or are these the individual  the ones with the beeps that they 're getting , that they made mistakes on is the mixed one ?  Or they 're indivi  If it 's individual , um y c we can probably run a forced alignment ,  where you c include the beeps as words and pretty much figure out where the errors are .  I don't think we could do it on the mixed signal ,  cuz it  But on the individual channels that would probably work , if they have enough words in the transcript .  So , I mean , that 's pretty quick to run .  It it 's , um  I mean , we could try it .  Cuz if a beep is treated as a unique word ,  "" beep ""  Put in put "" beep "" in as a word .  Yeah . Yeah . Well the beep model Actually , you could train a beep model .  That that 's a good idea .  Um  Yeah .  Yeah . So , um  Um , that might actually  I mean , that might actually work ,  because you 'll I guess the trick is figuring out , you know , where it doesn't align ?  But if it 's a problem of extra beeps , rather than missing beeps , then um that 's easier  and it might work .  Oh .  Oh , yeah .  Yeah .  You could have , um , each speaker in the meeting say "" beep "" and record it  and that will be their pro  Sorry .  Hmm .  But yo I guess you 'd still get the mistake that you mentioned ,  because the person  I mean , if that 's some of the errors , those would probably stay the same , regardless .  Yeah , you have like a sanity sanity check on them .  That 's a good idea .  Alternating .  Yeah , that 's a good , like , error checking approach , I think .  There must be .  Because otherwise , you 're going a whole  That was at least forty - five minutes ,  right ?  That 's the shortest meeting we have .  Most of them are double that , or  so  So if there are in the in the hundreds and thou or thousands of these  It must be in the high hundreds of them , at least .  So that 's getting a little cumbersome for them to type , like , five hundred ?  But yeah , if they recycle through  Yeah .  Right .  That 's what I  Yeah , so it 'd be a lot of overhead to type .  Oh , I  Yeah .  Yeah .  Actually , if it is  u  I mean , it 's not a bad idea to try the alignment .  Um , if there 's only like three of them , then if you align , the first point at which things get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem .  And then , the second p  I mean , you could do it that way ,  or you could  It 's it 's  it would be able to handle any errors .  So if they make , on the average , that many , and it costs them more time to do something different than what they 're doing , which I don't know , but if it does , then we could try doing that as a post - process ,  and , um , have a student or a transcriber run this alignment ,  or we can do it  and  then you can iteratively figure out where the problems are .  It would take a little work ,  but not any real human not a lot of human work .  Well , the for the forced alignment will run fa  otherwise it 'll take forever .  I mean , to really run recognition ?  Or ?  Right .  Yeah , then we just map it to a reject model .  In and in fact , that 's what we do now .  Cuz there 's cases , even after Jane listens , where , you know , we have  an expert can't even tell what they 're talking about .  Um , so that 's OK .  Just map that to reject  and  The forced alignment might not work then ,  although we can try it .  Um  Right .  Right . But it 'll it 'll grab the next beep , in other words .  It 'll be  You 'll get back another offset .  Um I mean , I was thinking of  then I and then I realized "" Well , the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beeps ,  and then there 'll be all the extra beeps at the end  if there were more beeps then you wanted . ""  So you need the word you need the word to c sort of control the relative location .  It will tell you  Oh .  I think you do care about it .  Unless you wanna know if they 're  Right .  Otherwise you just count up the total number of beeps .  Yeah .  Right .  I mean the only thing I 'm worried about with that approach is that if we need to figure out the beep alignment problem before the transcribers do the corrections here , then we 're in trouble .  In other words , if the transcripts aren't sort of good enough that the aligner constraints are good enough to sort of show you where the errors are , then it wouldn't work .  But it might work .  ",,
Bmr022.C,"It might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close on the words that usually get recognized correctly ,  which are the , you know , function words ,  the common words .  Right , you can also  In fact that 's what we do  Right . The individual segments between the beeps  Um , if beeps were like the segments that we get from um , the transcription tool already , that that 's what we have done ,  and it works very well .  You can see these segments align and these don't .  Um , then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoints of those segments are ,  cuz some of them will be wrong .  Because the bi the beeps were missing , by definition .  So it might actually work .  Um , you ca you get , um  Definitely when they don't align at all , it it it fails .  I mean , that that 's how we found a lot of problems before , with , um , words being on the wrong place or something .  So a failed alignment is a very good indicator that that the words don't match up .  Um  Yeah , is , uh it Right .  It can't match up the  That 's why you actually need the text .  In order to force you to try to match something that gives you a model to match against .  So  It 's just an idea , if if it turns out that  I mean , I also like this idea of high and low beeps , or  But it if Suppose we get one or two errors , still , per you know , per transcript , then we z we might wanna try some approach like that .  Where it is .  Right .  If so , if that doesn't add time for them , that 'd be great .  You know , like  We have to ask them .  I guess also even for the transcribers , it 's quicker to load a smaller file  into the You know , t for the checking problem .  Into twenty minutes chunks or something ,  or  I haven't looked at these ,  um  cuz I was gone last week ,  but but Don had told me that there 's a difference in some of the conventions ?

Um , I wouldn't well , it they didn't say "" hate ""  but they they c they come on time to their meetings in order to not be left the last person who has to sit by those mikes .  There were a few people you , and like , three or four people who really like them .  And e and th all the others really don't .  What about just a different headband thing ?

I mean , can we keep the microphones , and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head ?  That 's my problem with this one .  The the ear thing comes out to here .  It doesn't even fit over my ear .  And for some of the others , it 's their ears were shaped in a way that didn't hold the  What about these  Another one just bit the dust .  I think there 's a problem with this one .  I have a quick question about microphones ,  um  I got this crazy idea that , um , i in the future , people will just walk around with the microphones that they use for their cell phones ?  You know , these little boom ones ,  like , and really go to meetings with close talking mikes .  If they 're their own personal microphone .  And so I 'm wondering if we can get a couple of tho  I don't know how good quality they are ,  but it would be really interesting to see if they 're good enough .  The k kind that guys that like to look like they 're really cool at airports wear .  You can't miss it .  You cannot miss it .  They 're the guys going around  they 're probably talking to nobody ,  but  Yes .  They wear the heads  E Well , there you go .  Yes .  That 's that it looks sort of like that .  OK , so whatever people sort of wear to use l  Yeah , something like tha with their cell phones ,  it 'd be really great , I think , if we can argue t that  people like that .  Are they ?  Oh , OK .  So it 's they 're not compatible ?  Well ,  um , just as an example for , you know , the future , of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphones ,  or some people might ,  to meetings ,  you know .  Not a I 'm not saying there 's not a far - field microphone , uh , application ,  but  If we have a choi I 've always wondered how well they would work .  Oh , right . So they could use the  Anyway , it 's just an idea .  Um  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Can you just do , like , SUX or something to modify  I mean , if you just have one user that  Mm - hmm .  But it doesn't have to be root .  It could be some other user that we all can SUX to .  I mean  Oh . So tha that 's what I meant ,  it just some user like "" meeting - root "" or something .  I don't know .  Yeah .  ",,
Bmr022.C,"Yeah , you can  I mean  Is CVS , like  Yeah , just keep the lock on .  I mean , just check it out check it out  and don't let anyone check it out  Oh ,  it Oh , it doesn't .  Oh , OK .  Oh .  So why not use RCS at that point ? Just at that stage ?  It 's not remote .  But at that point we only want , probably , Jane to be in control anyway ,  and she  I mean , it 's just an i  But not to modify them ,  right ?  Just to read them .  I don't know ,  uh I mean  Then they should send that through  Well It 's sort of not really a question about permissions ,  but more of procedure .  Either those all go through Jane , or through someone ,  or they all don't .  But it 's sort of  And if they all do , then there isn't a problem ,  right ?  Cuz once they give us the data , it 's ours ,  and if they wanna make changes  I mean , ours to sort of transcribe and annotate .  And if they wanna make changes , they can do that .  So then if they do have acc  OK , so what if they have What if they have accounts here , and they use RCS ,  at that point , where you can l really lock a file .  I mean , I 'm worried . If you can't lock a file , this this to me sounds very scary .  Um  And if they have accounts here and they 're modifying it  If they 're ac if they 're so closely linked that they 're actually modifying transcripts and "" key "" files , then they could do it by , you know , secure - shelling into ICSI , under RCS , at that point .  Mm - hmm .  So , maybe there is a way in CVS to effectively lock something if you don't want people to make any changes ?  Uh - huh .  Oh .  So  So then you could use CVS  and , you know , just f have remote access ,  but then it 's up to whoever is , sort of , responsible for that level of transcription to decide how and when to put these locks ,  or  Yeah .  Right .  So if that 's at an  I guess it depends on Jane 's  Uh , you know ,  if that 's if that model works for the transcripts , then that 's fine .  But if that pr @ @ um , allows someone to come in and modify while you 're modifying , and they turn out to be changes that , you know , would have been better to wait until your version came out , then that 's really up to you ,  not up to the software ,  Yeah , that 's what I would be worried about too .  Right .  I mean , I like that idea  because even a casual user can always send email to whoever 's in charge ,  and say , you know , "" we 'd like these changes ""  and , you know , hopefully we 'll give them a response .  And if they really do it a lot , and they say "" we 're a casual user but we want a chance to change the transcripts "" then we can face that if it happens ,  but  I don't really see the people at UW that I know of right now making huge amoun investing huge amounts of time in changing transcripts .  But I could be wrong .  Yeah .  Right .  Right . And there 's some happy medium  and we don't know what that is yet until we get feedback from people ,  but what if it 's OK to just handle it with sort of a person in charge of the philosophy behind the changes ,  and some people with permissions , maybe by request , to make changes ,  That we don't just give people permissions if they 're not gonna make changes .  Because I 've overwritten a a file by mistake ,  not wanting to have done that  cuz I didn't think I had permission , when I did .  Um , and then just seeing if that is enough to to handle the transcript changes .  I 'm just worried about letting everybody go in and make changes ,  cuz it 's real easy when you 're trying to , I don't know , run alignments and there 's a word you wanna fix , to go in and do that and then mess up other things ,  if you don't know , you know , the overall philosophy behind the the conventions .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Exactly .  Or just , yeah , start by make it a really tight control  and then as people really need the control you can ascertain whether or not to  Right .  Right .  I think we 're already gonna I mean there 's already some chance that different annotations , different places , you know  But you can control that by knowing you 're making two corpora  or knowing that you 're adding um , annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that point .  And then you finish the project and you realize that there were corrections made on your originals  and then you have to merge them .  And the b the thing that makes it ea OK to do that , is knowing where the synch time boundaries are .  Cuz you can automatically pretty much merge things if you 've only got twenty words or so in an utterance .  It 's when you get the whole meeting  and the synch times ch have changed ,  ",,
Bmr022.C,"or you can't correspond to a previous version with synch times , that you get in trouble .  So .  Was there anything else on your list ?  Now , wait , are are we doing them simultaneously or one at a time ?  Alright .  ",,

Bmr022.E,"Is it on ?  One of the things that Adam said that I thought would be a good idea would be , um , if we g used different beeps .  So for example if we alternated between two beeps , a high and a low .  th  Uh , well in in some email that , uh , we had .  Yeah . Um Because then  Yeah .  Sort of a text template ,  but I don't know how we can do that .  Well , l I I thought it was a lot more than that .  They were three off , basically .  Yeah .  Well the only the only question about that that I have is , um , I think Brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape .  So I don't know whether  Can he send them I guess he could send them multiple tapes  Uh  Mm - hmm .  Well , the only other issue is we 'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order .  Uh  Individual channels .  Yeah , we In fact , that 's Yeah , maybe we  We have the original wavefile with all the beeps .  It would be very good .  Yeah , very low .  It could t it could There could be some missing ones .  But  Increasingly high higher frequencies .  And then when we get them back , if we see two L - beeps in a row  And it would it seems like it would help them ,  you know , if they just finished a long passage and they heard one beep and then they hear it again , they know it 's the same beep .  Versus if they heard a slightly different one .  Yeah .  Maybe I should write to Brian and tell him what the problem was  and what our proposed solutions are .  See what he thinks would work best with them .  And there are some  And there are some cases where there 's , um , very little speech before you hear a beep .  So you hear a little bit of speech , beep ,  a little bit of speech , beep .  Maybe three of those in a row ,  and was that three beeps ,  was that two beeps ?  Um See , they have th Brian said the setup that they have is , um  uh i um  They 've got headphones  and then I guess they have a computer ,  and they have a foot pedal  which lets them quickly scan back and forth through the tape .  I i t i s  makes the tape go real fast forward or fast backward .  And so they can hear something , then step on the pedal and quickly rewind and go back and hear it again .  And so they 're  I think they 're probably going over and over f sections .  And then they get confused about whether they 've already put that beep ,  or if they heard , you know , three beeps in a row , was that three or two ,  and  Oh , that 's an interesting idea .  No , no , no . But wait , maybe maybe what we have instead of a beep is a , uh , synthesized number .  And they put the number in when they hear it .  So , inst replacing the beep with "" twenty - three "" ,  "" twenty - four "" ,  "" twenty - five ""  And then they have to transcribe what that number is each time .  Yeah , just a "" two three , two four "" , that would be  There 'd be some kind of mark in front of it .  Well it would have t yeah , it would have to be um , you know either obviously a s sounding synthesized , uh , little  Yeah .  Or a beep and the number .  Uh , right .  In fact , we could put it at the beginning of each utterance .  We could say "" beep one "" .  And then they 'll hear the speech .  Or a number beep  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , and u I think it would I Actually , I thi I like that .  I think it would  Yeah .  But see that would that would definitely keep  Yeah .  Keep things from getting out of sequence .

You know actually , what all that we would  You know , Liz , all we would re  I mean if in terms of the alignment , actually , all we would need is we wouldn't even need words .  We would need a general speech model and a beep model .  Cuz all we 're really concerned about is missing beeps or too many beeps .  So if we had a  Mm - hmm .

So do you get a score for each alignment ?  Is that what you get ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I 'm just wondering when wha what it means to fail .  Is it the the likelihood scores below some threshold  Just  Just accumulate it till you get twenty minutes worth ?  There 's one file .  Yeah , I 'll  I 'll talk to him .  Really ?  Oh , yeah , you do .  There 's another kind which s goes in your ear  and it hangs down .  There 's a little b bulb  that hangs has the mike on it .  How standard are these ?  It is an interesting idea .  If we could build an adaptor that went from  cuz I think mine looks like this too .  If we had this style plug that went to that , then we 'd just have adaptors  and people would plug them in .  You could use they could use their own .  I don't understand .  So so there 's a mike that plugs in  You 're saying there 's a mike that plugs in to the IRAM board ?  or  Oh , I see .  Well , I I was  I was reading through some of the CVS documentation  and you can just substitute CVS for your R S H command .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Well they 're gonna have to have accounts  If they use SSH they have to have an account anyways .  That 's what we do with doctor - speech though ,  right ?  But there is a user doctor - speech .  Right ?  I mean , I I SUX to doctor - speech w when I need to make a a directory on , uh , one of the  Well , with CVS , though , you don't actually have to do it that way .  What I 'm saying is that it can be the case that people can do it themselves and it can be reviewed .  Right ?  I mean , it 's not like it 's one or the other .  We can do both .  Right .  No , it does not the CVS doesn't work that way .  There 's no there 's no lock when you check something out ,  not like RCS .  In other words , everybody can check out anything .  The C stands for "" concurrent "" .  But typically a person has to , uh , mediate you know , which changes actually get go through .  CVS is pretty good .  Yeah , so the w  In  The Maybe the model  It 's a little bit different in CVS .  When you check something out , you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it ,  and that 's what you work on .  So , until you 're ready to check it in , nobody sees anything you 've done .  And then when you check it in , it puts , sort of , you know every change that you 've done is goes into the central  Well yeah , there would there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency .  Yeah .  Well , I think  yeah , I think there are probably ways that you can say that , you know , only certain users are allowed to change things .  Uh , so we can probably restrict it to be  You know , f casual users who are just browsing can just r get it read - only ,  can't check in to the archive .  Whereas we could say "" other people "" , you know , "" these people are allowed to actually submit changes "" .  I mean , I I think one thing that 's probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where you know , we can say that for sure there 's no problems with any of the transcripts .  I mean there 's ,  uh f You know , something 's going to get overlooked at some point ,  or somebody 's gonna wanna make a change somehow .  So we need to have some mechanism for , um , handling changes in the future .  Yeah . Exactly .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  Good point .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , that 's a good point .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah I mean a lot of the open source pro projects face this same problem .  You know , p anybody can check out the code ,  but not everybody can check it in .  Yeah .  Then There is also the possibility Remember , in CVS , when we talk about making changes , there 's sort of two types that can be made .  To your local , or to the global .  And so people can make changes to their local  and if they screw those up , that 's , you know , in their that 's only on them .  It 's w it 's the checking in part that r we really care about ,  and that we can control with , you know , who can check things in and stuff .  So we can I think we can do this .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . They can still check it out  ",,
Bmr022.E,"Yeah , cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies .  And it won't affect the the g the global , official , ones at all .  Yes .  Definitely .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Lee , you liked that l  huh ?  ",,
Bmr022.F,"Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah , that 's true .  I 've noticed that . Yeah .  Which makes sense .  Oh , on the email .  Yeah .

You 'd have to they 'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t hear into the high high ranges .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  It 's a shame we can't really give a number .  So it would be a number and a beep .  e  It 's a shame we can't do that .  That 'll work .  Wow , that 'd also be shorter to type .  Interesting .  Oh , that 's true .  Or maybe could it be a click and the number .  Or a beep and the number , and then and then you just do the the num th you do it as a d a digit .  Well , if if it saves time ,  yeah .  It might actually help them in terms of their place holding .  Yeah .  And it might be helpful to them in terms of d act  Know  Well , no no no no .  OK .  I i  And then also , if we I mean , I don't know what their setup is , but your template idea might be a way of of of  We could actually build the numbers into a template .  Well .  That 's a good idea .  Very simple .  It 's forty - five minutes .  Forty - five minutes for that one .  It 's possible .  Yeah . That 's right .  Yeah , it was forty - five minutes .  Hmm , interesting .  Well , with just one digit though ,  I think  Well , and the other thing is , maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I think it would save them time .  I think it would help them keep the track track of it .  Interesting ,  yeah .  So , someone 's gonna talk to Brian .  OK .  I also looked thr over the text  and I was impressed by the accuracy ,  it looks really good .  Yeah , it 's there .  Mm - hmm .  Oh . Yes . But this is not important .  It 's systematic ,  yeah .  And and Brian actually forwarded me in advance .  He he wor he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they 're used to .  Which is which is really a good a good way to do it .  No problem .  Yeah . We can do it this week .  Yeah .  I thought we were going to get two more of the ones  Can I I c I  I actually really like them though .  Yeah , I do .  The other thing , too , is th y you said that the acoustic pra q quality of the one that you 're wearing , the fancy one , is actually somewhat better than  So I I don't know if it 's a noticeable difference ,  but it is  I mean , I p I personally really prefer that model ,  so I think you know we 've got this problem of people having different different preferences .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  It 's I I understand ,  that 's fine with me .  I I g would say that um , I find this model easier to adjust ,  that 's one of the reasons I don't like these ,  cuz I keep m you know , bending it ,  and then it 's n and I never really know  You do ?  OK .  Hmm .  Huh .  Then they have to be rewired though ,  don't they ?  Specially .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  You you put it over the corner of your ear .  I can't I 'm having competing microphone headphone problems here .  This one .  It 's an interesting idea .  The acoustics  the acoustics on this are really s m better than when I talk into it directly .  Works with this .  I don't know .  I had another thought .  Would w would it be possi  There are scripts that uh , run ,  and and when it 's finished compressing , would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict ?  Have them  But after the meeting 's done , would they want to ?  That 's true .  Yeah , that 's true .  Also it seems like once it 's been stored that night , it 's it 's possible to recover from backups ,  so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded .  Yeah . Yeah .  And I 'd prefer it to go through me .  Well I p At this point  Yeah .  Yeah .  w w  Well  I I wanna also say that , you know , this is a  ",,
Bmr022.F,"uh , uh , My my view on this is that once it 's in a final version and I 'm working toward all these being final versions , then it can go into this next ro this next realm .  But it it 's sort of counter - productive to have changes made which I would be making if I 'd just gotten that far in the file .  You know , it 's it 's , um .  Yeah .  That 's right .  And then after that , then this would probably work .  Yeah .  Good , good .  Well , the "" key "" file is  ke "" key "" file 's different .  "" Key "" fi  Well , "" key "" file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel  so - and - so , it 's useful as a repository for putting that there .  And also if you notice that there was an extra speaker ,  and didn't get mentioned in the "" key "" file ,  but they were only there for a second ,  but it 's t useful to mention that they were there .  So I th I think that the "" key "" file is usefu for notations related to the meeting ,  but it 's different from the transcript .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Hmm .  That 's interesting .  Oh .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  I also think , um , that the type of change ch ch varies an I think it 's a very good point .  Because what if the uh , what if one set of changes one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention .  And the other person n unkn n quite unknowingly , was changing it the other way around .  Then you could end up with a real mess ,  in terms of , like , consistency of conventions across a file , there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level .  But I like b I like what Liz is saying about  That 's right .  And I also like I l also like Liz 's uh , k um , phraseology of "" at this level of "" I don't remember how you put it , but this "" at this level of transcription "" or whatever .  I mean it 's like there are different layers of whatever  and different types of conventions ,  and if it were an acronym , then I would I think that it would make sense f for them to have input into that level of things ,  but I wouldn't want them to be changing  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well ,  yeah .  I agree .  Well  Well , I see now , we 're k back into the same situation as when we were , uh , talking about a allowing people to edit the transcripts before they become public .  So there 's a question of how easy or how hard to modify ,  and how that impacts the amount of changing that 's done .  And I I think that it 's , um ,  I I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made .  And um , I think with an acronym , that 's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate .  But it would worry me to have people , um , having free reign to change these things , because of the need to have consistent conventions .  And people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it ,  which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts .  u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting .  You said that there were some places where it wasn't what y was written already , but you could see how they might have thought that 's what it said .  So there it 's not just a right and wrong thing .  Sometimes there tru there are absolutely stretches where there is no no k if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person ,  maybe , m you know , they could they could 've told you ,  but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you ,  even if they were listening to it .  So , sometimes it isn't right and wrong ,  sometimes it 's multiple interpretations ,  and  Now But of course , this does raise the possibility of allowing , um , an extra annotation for , you know , alternative interpretations of a stretch .  But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong .  Or overlooked or not overlooked .  Sometimes they 're truly ambiguous ,  and um , uh , um ,  nice to have a notation for that ,  but . Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  And als it also  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Ooo !  ",,

So , um , we Uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling "" set one "" ,  which was the s the set that I 've been , uh OK , talking about up to this point ,  but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set .  Right now they 're in the process of being edited .  Um , the , um  Let 's see ,  I hired two transcribers today . I 'm thinking of hiring another one ,  which will because we 've had a lot of attrition .  And that will bring our total to  Yeah .  Well , you know , it 's it 's various things .

Uh , through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two , but they 're really solid .  We 're really lucky the two that we kept .  And , um Well , I don't mean I don't mean anything against the others . What I mean is we 've got a good cause a good core . No . We had a good core  Yeah , but still . I mean , I d it 's just a matter of we w we 're we 've got , uh ,  two of the ones who who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a a lot of hours ,  which is wonderful , and excellent work .  And so , then , in addition , um , I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this within this coming week ,  but but the plan is just as , uh , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side ,  you know ,  rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now ,  because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we wouldn't wanna have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff .

Now there was , uh , I g guess  So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation  f for just very few days you were away .  But it happened to be during that time I needed one ,  so I so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours  and , um , they , um you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available .  And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um Um .  So they really appreciate it .  But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while .  You know , once in a while there 's something like ,  um , and e Actually you talked to them .  Didn't you ?  Did you ? Have you ?  And and and she was  And so , I asked her  I mean , They 're very perceptive .  I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers .  I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that  and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns .

It 's it 's complicated in that um , hhh , i hhh , i  There is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version .  So it 's not a pure it 's not a pure condition .  Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through .

Cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain ,  and and doing spot - checking here and there .

We just have to give them a chance to listen to it , and if they don't , that 's their problem .  No , I 'm serious .  Really ?  Mmm .  Spurts wouldn't be .  Right ?  No  Have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ?  Yeah .  Well , no , I mean t time time position relative to the beginning of the spurt .  Yeah .

So so , the thing is is do we expect ?  eh At this point I 'm as I mean , you know e I 'm wondering is it Can we expect , uh , a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know , a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with , you know , the right ch choice of parameters ?  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now  and I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features  uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the SRI system ,  but  it 's  Yeah .  And I 'm wondering how we can how we can debug that .  I mean how  Um .  I 'm actually f quite sure that the feeding the features into the system and training it up ,  that that I think that 's this that 's essentially the same as we use with the ce with the P L P fe features .  And that 's obviously working great .  So . I um .  There we could  the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform ?  Right ?  We to  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  No . The the SRI system does it .  Yeah .  So , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered ,  but  Right .  They 're optimized for phone discrimination ,  not for  Mm - Mmm .  Do y  But  And there 's a mismatch in the phone sets .  So , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what  Mm - hmm .  Oh , we already talked about that .  El  Yeah .  No , but we we when when we when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this , I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there .  Yeah .  Uh - huh . And i does it help ?  Oh , OK .  Oh . OK .  And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector ?  Do you d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector ?  OK .  Because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  OK . Actually , I have to run .  Uh .  ","which is about what we get with uh , with , you know , just @ @ actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um , the , uh uh , with the standard system .  So , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization  So , it looks like the P L - fea P features do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work .  Right . And and what that suggests also is of course that the current Switchboard MLP isn't trained on very good features .  Well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now .  eh At this point I 'm as I mean , you know e I 'm wondering is it Can we expect , uh , a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know , a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with , you know , the right ch choice of parameters ?

I mean , did Dan do experiments like that to ?  Mmm .  Yeah .  Hmm .

And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned "" uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . ""  I said "" what offsets ? ""  And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data  and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen  and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop !  there 's this big DC offset .  So , um , in PLP  No . It 's just , it it 's it 's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets .  It 's it 's , you know , no big deal .  It 's you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever ,  and it 's consistently in there .  The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency ,  so that it 's irrelevant .  Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that .  We had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L  but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency ,  like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does .  We had something more fancy .  It was later on  it didn't have that .  So at that point I reali "" oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter ""  just , you know just take care of the problem .  So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety ninety hertz or so uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate .  And I never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates .  And so well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that  and so this is all at eight kilohertz  and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety .  So , um ,  I don't know if Dan fixed it or or , uh , what he  He made it a parameter .  So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it  and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate ,  which is great .  He had a  H  ",,
Bmr023.F,"Yeah . Does HPF on on his feat feature .  Yeah .  I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either ,  so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing ,  which is another old old bug of mine .  But , um  Um . So that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz  and it just wasn't doing it ,  so now it is .  So , that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent .  It still wasn't a big deal .  Oh , yeah .  But but , I guess my my point was that that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways .  And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a a a competitive system .  But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se .  I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this .  Uh , unless you call well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more .  But that 's sort of more both , kind of .  Right ?  But .  Mm - hmm .  Well , that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . Yes .  Right ?  So , it 's so ,  um , um  I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative .  So . Um .  Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much  and and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do ,  not just th the standard front - end ,  but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth ,  and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel .  Um , so I think I think that 's the real power of it .  I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements .  Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better .  If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Let let me let me just ask you something .  When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs  and they 're and  through the KLT .  OK .  And so so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT  or ?  OK .  Yes .  Yes .  Yeah .  Uh . Talk with Stephane .  He did some things like that .  It was either him or Carmen .  I forget .  I mean these were all different databases and different you know , in HTK and all that ,  so i it it may not apply .  But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse .  But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components .  Yeah .  Which could be good or not .  Yeah .  Yeah . Worth trying .  There might be ,  cuz that 's a pretty big difference .  But  Hmm .  What if ?  That 's  well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net .  These nets are trained with particular normalization  and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it .  OK .  Right .  Well , you might e e  Yeah .  Yeah . I I would actually double check with Stephane at this point ,  cuz he 's probably the one here  I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem  thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not not being handled right .  Not unless you had a lot of time  and  That 's right .  Well , the other  Yeah , th the  Well , you actually are .  But but it but in an indirect way .  So wha w what an and you may not be in this case ,  come to think of it ,  because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere .  So , what what you what you do in the full procedure is you , um , uh , have an embedded training .  So in fact you the the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system .  And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant .  You can prove that it 's it 's a ,  uh  If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh by training up on local local , uh local frames .  But , um , we aren't actually doing that here ,  because we did we did that for a hybrid system ,  ","And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a a a competitive system .  But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se .  I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this .  Yeah . I I would actually double check with Stephane at this point ,  Not unless you had a lot of time  ","Work on the front end continues, with improvements of 3-5% being made. "
Bmr023.F,"and now we 're plugging it into another system  and so it isn't i i i it wouldn't quite apply here .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah . Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be .  So that would save a lot of time .  Yeah . Actually all those things could could could could , uh could affect it as well .  The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one ,  uh , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning .  Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great .  Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones .  Um , however , there 's times when it is not good .  Uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one .  So , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , Gaussian mixture system , uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it ,  but actually Stephane did it  and and and it helped a lot .  Yeah .  So that 's that that 's our current best best system in the , uh uh , in the Aurora thing .  Yeah .  I I , uh , missed what you said .  Yeah .  Well , actually , I , uh you should check with him ,  because he tried several different combinations .  Yeah . I , uh , th  what I don't remember is which came out best .  So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT ,  and another one , since the the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and and just did a KLT on the on the on the net outputs  and then concatenated that .  And I don't remember which was better .  No . I don't know , i I I don't know .  You have to check with him .  I 'm into big ideas these days .  Not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks .  Yeah .  Uh  Um .  I I g I think , given that we 're in a hurry for snacks , maybe we should do them together .

Yes .  So you just need to copy over to this one .  Yeah .  And even The good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good  because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones ,  but I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're we 're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out .

Bmr023.G,"that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings .  Well .  I mean , it 's I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount  We have eight meetings there  because we couldn't use the non - native all non - native meetings  and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at  because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them .  Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns  and we 're hoping that maybe with , I don't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results .  But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , um , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , um , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers ,  which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words .  Um , so these are based on forced alignment .  Word features like , um , word frequency  and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth .  So , we 're starting to see , I think , some interesting patterns .  I think it depends what you 're looking at , a actually .  Right .  Um ,  spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words ,  but roughly speaking , the recognized words are gonna give you a similar type of position .  It 's either early or late .  Not exactly , but i  Y yeah it should be .  Well , we don't know  and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is a sort of  So .  Eh  You know , uh  Yeah ,  uh , we didn't try it ,  but it 's s  Right .  And it depends on speaking rate  speaking rate . Yeah .  Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first .  But we one of the interesting things was  I guess you reported on some te punctuation type  finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries ,  and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt ,  so where you know , if I 'm talking now and someone and and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based .  And there the prosodic features actually showed up  and a neat thing  even though the word features were available .  And a neat thing there too is I tried some putting the speaker  So , I gave everybody a short version of their name .  So the real names are in there ,  which we couldn't use .  Uh , we should use I Ds or something .  And those don't show up .  So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person ,  um ,  but was sort of trying to , uh , get a general idea  the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers ,  even though there are huge speaker effects .  So .  The but the main limitation now is I because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words , we need more more data and more data per speaker .  So .  It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings  because we did include meeting type as a feature ,  so  whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter to interrupts  because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings .  And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person ,  which is not bad .  It 'd probably do better than Um , but it wasn't generalizing .  So it 's  And I think Don , um Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer ,  where we can  And he 'll be able to report on more things in the future .  But it was great that we could at least go from the you know , Jane 's transcripts and the , uh , recognizer output and get it to this point .  And I think it 's something Mari can probably use in her preliminary report  like , "" yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers  and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . ""  The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard .  And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes ,  cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the Switchboard telephone bandwidth .  Um . Well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , um , halvings and doublings than than Switchboard  and there 's a lot less dropout ,  so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information ,  in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words  for for , you know , five word  there are much fewer than in Switchboard .

And , that sort of , um , is useful ,  and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up .  OK .  Well , I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version ,  and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful ,  and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ?  And so I 've uh , I , uh , uh , I 've trained the new one uh , the new the newest one , to , um , use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time .  And that 's just amazingly helpful .  Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation .  And that 'll be something like I it 's ver it 's interesting .  Once in a while it 's a backchannel .  Sometimes it seems to be , um , similar to the ones that are being picked up .  And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly .  You just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips .  And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh better coverage of the backchannels ,  but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation  because there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all .  And , uh , the audio quality is so good  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So I think that that 's gonna , also eh , you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process .

She 's also checking through and mar and and monitoring , um , the transcription of another transcriber .  And , I 've moved on now to what I 'm calling set three .  I sort of thought if I do it in sets groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a a parallel processing through through the the current .  And and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , for the for the , um , the , uh , DARPA demo , of twenty hours .  So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and and that 's that 's what my goal is .  Well , I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version ,  and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful ,  and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ?  And so I 've uh , I , uh , uh , I 've trained the new one uh , the new the newest one , to , um , use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time .  Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation .  And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh better coverage of the backchannels ,  but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation  Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason .

That that was basically it .  Not not much @ @  Oh , so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready ,  and  Yeah .  I listened to probably , uh , five or ten minutes of it from the beginning .  Yeah .  And  And the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them .

I g hope he got it and hopefully he 's  maybe he 's gone ,  I dunno .  He didn't even reply to my message .  So . I should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it .

It 's a lot more believable , too ,  if you tell them that they 're the computer part is running on a Windows machine .  And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense .  Where does this ?  There 's a couple other questions that I have too ,  and and one of them is , what about , uh , consent issues ?  And the other one is , what about transcription ?  Are ?  OK .  So we don't have to worry about transcribing it ?  I bet that sounds good ,  huh ?  OK .  I dunno if you want that .  Yeah .  Are we only half ?  I thought we were more than that .

Bmr024.D,"Well , so , here 's the thing .  Um , why don't we s again start off with with ,  uh ,  Yeah , I 'll get it .  I 'll get the door .  Um , I think we want to start off with the agenda .  And then , given that , uh , Liz and Andreas are gonna be ten , fifteen minutes late , we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here .  So So so , one thing is , yeah , talk about demo ,  IBM transcription .  Uh , what else ?  What 's SmartKom ?  SmartKom ?  What what what are we collecting here ?  Yeah , right .  Uh , right .  Uh .

I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing .  SmartKom also , Andreas .  Absinthe , I think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Um  So , I mean , I think they 'll be inter I 'll be interested in all this ,  but but , uh , probably , if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . Or I guess it would be , you think , reorganization status ,  or ?  OK .  OK .  Well , maybe uh , since that that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status .  Someone can fill in Liz and Andreas later .  Uh  OK .  Le - let 's talk about it ,  because that 's that 's something that I I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is ,  so , you know .  It 's good  Actually , maybe I One one relate more related thing in transcription .  So that 's the IBM stuff .  We 've got that sorted out .  Um , how 're we doing on the on the rest of it ?  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Yeah , uh ,  so twenty hours .  But I guess the other thing is that , um , that that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it .  So . OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , that 's good .

Well , forced alignment would be one thing .  What about just actually doing recognition ?  No , they make mistakes .  Right .  Um  Yeah , I 'm I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about .  I mean I  I mean , uh , we 're talking about digits now .  And and so , um , there 's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet .  Uh .  And , um , there 's the issue that that they we know what what was said , but do we ?  Because people make mistakes and stuff .  I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if if with , uh uh , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error ,  uh , would we would we do better ?  So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , uh , or false starts , it 's it 's much less c it 's much less common than one percent ?  We should be able to .  Right ?  Yeah .  So that 's just my question .  I 'm not saying it should be one way or the other , but it 's If  Well  Yeah , it 's Y you raised a point , kind of , uh , euphemistically  but , I mean , m maybe it is a serious problem .  Ho - what will they do when they go hear "" beep seven beep seven three five two ""  I mean , you think they 'll we 'll get ?  Yeah ?  Yeah .  OK .  Well , I I I dunno ,  I I think that that 's if they are in fact going to transcribe these things , uh , certainly any process that we 'd have to correct them , or whatever is needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff .  So , why not ?  Sure .  That was it ?  OK .  Well , we we we wanna have them .  Yeah , I  I in Berkeley , yeah .  So , uh You you have to go a little early ,  right ?  At twenty  Alright .  So le let 's make sure we do the ones that that , uh , saved you .  So there was some Uh In in Adam 's agenda list ,  he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ?  OK .

So should we save it ?  Now th  Yeah .  So we save it because it 's it it 's potentially useful .  And now , what do we do with it is is a s separate question .

O - You you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you .  All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings .  And similarly we 're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings .  Those aren't meetings .  But if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out .  You know ?  Alright .  Ah .  Good point .  Good point .

And the pru the question he was asking at one point about pruning ,  uh  Remember that one ?  Well , he was he 's it looked like the probabil at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out at the likelihoods he was getting out of PLP versus mel cepstrum , and they looked pretty different ,  as I recall .  And so , uh , there 's the question  But , still it 's a question  if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something ,  or ?  But , you 're only talking about a percent or two .  Right ?  Here we 're - we 're saying that we there gee , there 's this b eh , there 's this difference here .  And it  See cuz , i i there could be lots of things .  Right ?  But but but but , um , let 's suppose just for a second that , uh , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the the major differences , uh , between the two .  I mean , we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration ,  and and , well , we 're making sure that low and high  Before we i i th with straight PLP , it 's trapezoidal also .

Although Dave basically said that if we wanna do it , just tell him and he 'll do a d level zero then .  So .  Yep .  So , I think we do need to talk a little bit about  Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting .  We have a little more to discuss .  But , uh , we 're we 're basically ready to do it .  And , uh , I have some web pages on ts more of the background .  So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date .  So .  And I 've been sharing them with U - d UW folks also .  Sharing them with the UW folks .  OK .  So , we , uh we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit .  Chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits ,  and so it just goes "" beep one beep "" and then the phrase ,  and then "" beep two beep "" and then the phrase .  And that seems pretty good .  Um , I think they 'll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file .  And we did it with the automatic segmentation ,  and I don't think We ne we didn't look at it in detail .  We just sent it to IBM .  We we sorta spot - checked it .  Oh , really ?  OK .  I sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good .  So . I think it 'll work .  And , uh , we 'll just hafta see what we get back from them .  Uh  Right .  Yep .  Well , I think it 's also they are much less likely to d have errors .  I mean , so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or and they put in extraneous beeps .  And with the numbers there , it 's much less likely .  Ha .  That 's interesting .  I didn't hear that .  Well , maybe we better listen to it again ,  make sure ,  but , I mean , certainly the software shouldn't do that ,  so .  Hiccups .  Yeah .  The only the only part that might be confusing is when Chuck is reading digits .  "" Seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two "" .  Yes .  Because , uh , we don't we didn't In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it .  And we wanted to avoid doing that ,  so we they are transcribing the digits .  Although we could tell them we could tell them , if you hear someone reading a digits string just say "" bracket digit bracket ""  and don't bother actually computing the di writing down the digits .  Yep .  And then I wanted to talk about but as I said I we may not have time what we should do about digits .  We have a whole pile of digits that haven't been transcribed .  OK .  Do we have anything else to say about transcription ?  About IBM stuff ?  OK .  Alright .  So , we have a whole bunch of digits ,  if we wanna move on to digits .  Hmm .  It 'll keep your accuracy up .  Yep .  And correcting .  Correcting .  We 'll we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections .  Oh , right .  I see what you mean .  A backchannel , or  Mm - hmm .  Uh , so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on ,  um , but only a small number of that ha  well , not a small number  only a subset of that has been transcribed .  And so we need to decide what we wanna do .  And , uh , Liz and Andreas actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment .  And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that .  But  ","I mean , I think , Chuck was the one who added out the agenda item .  I don't really have anything to say other than that we still haven't done it .  So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date .  And I 've been sharing them with U - d UW folks also .

","Progress has been made in naming conventions, with file reorganisation to be done at a later date, however this was not discussed fully due to Chuck's absence. In particular, the group discuss their preparation of materials for the transcriptions of digits by IBM, and also the human transcribers who are working towards preparing the set of 20 for the DARPA meeting. "
Bmr024.F,"so , I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing .  Well , we we know what they read , because we have the forms .  Right .  But , the point is that we wanna get a set of clean digits .  I mean , so one option i  But that 's pretty uncommon .  Um , if we could really get one percent on  Well , I guess yeah , I guess if we segmented it , we could get one percent on digits .  But ,  Well , there there 're a couple different of doing it .  We could use the tools I 've already developed and transcribe it .  Hire some people , or use the transcribers to do it .  We could let IBM transcribe it .  You know , they 're doing it anyway ,  and unless we tell them different , they 're gonna transcribe it .  Um , or we could try some automated methods .  And my my tendency right now is , well , if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it .  It 's pretty distinct .  The beeps are pre - recorded .  Yes .  I mean , it 'll be it will be in the midst of a digit string .  So  I mean it  sure , there there might be a place where it 's "" beep seven beep eight beep eight beep "" .  But , you know , they they 're they 're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks .  And so , I I don't think it 'll be a problem .  We 'll have to see ,  but I don't think it 's gonna be a problem .  Right .  That was it .  Just , what do we do with digits ?  We have so many of them , and it 'd be nice to actually do something with them .  Anything else ?  Your mike is a little low there .  Oops .  I could  Hand ones .  Right .  So , Rob Porzel  eh , Porzel ?  and the , uh Porzel and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues .  Basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere .  And , uh , they 're doing a travel task .  And , uh , it involves starting I believe starting with a  It 's it 's always the wizard ,  but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , speech generation system .  Synthesis system .  Um , and then , it goes to a real wizard and they 're evaluating that .  And they wanted to use this equipment , and so the w question came up , is  well , here 's some more data .  Should this be part of the corpus or not ?  And my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics , as opposed to just for language .  Um , or also for dialogue of various sorts .  Um , so it 's not a meeting .  Right ?  Because it 's two people and they 're not face to face .  At the beginning .  But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times .  Yep .  "" I have to go now .  You can talk to the computer . ""  "" No ! ""  Abort  abort , retry , fail ?  Well , this was this was the question .  So so they were saying they were not going to ,  and I said , "" well that 's silly , if if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . ""  I I see no reason not to do all of them .  That that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , uh , it 's nice to have the same for every recording .  Right .  So so so for their usage , they don't need anything .  Right ?  And then  Right .  So it 's It it I guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus .  So if , at UW they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ?  Well , this has two or more people conversing with each other .  They 're just not face to face .  I mean , that was my intention .  That was my intention .  So so s so part of the reason that I wanted to bring this up is , do we wanna handle it as a special case or do we wanna fold it in ,  we give everyone who 's involved as their own user ID , give it session I Ds , let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it , or do we wanna special case it ?  And if we were gonna special case it , who 's gonna do that ?  I don't see why not .  It 's just a different topic .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ?  Yeah , but those are folded in ,  and it 's just you just mark the transcripts differently .  So so one option is you fold it in ,  and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction .  Well , but but , I put it under the same directory tree .

Bmr024.F,"You know , it 's in "" user doctor speech data MR "" .  Other .  OK .  My preference is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to think too much about things .  And , just have a marking .  If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that .  Right .  So , w we will hafta worry about format .  Oh , OK .  OK .  Well , I didn't realize that .  That 's that 's a  Yep .  They they even have a reading list .  It 's pretty funny .  So  Disk might eventually be an issue so we might we we might need to , uh , get some more disk pretty soon .  We 're about we 're about half halfway through our disk right now .  We 're probably a little more than that because we 're using up some space that we shouldn't be on .  So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent .  Yep .  Were those backed - up or non - backed - up ?  Right .  So that 's different .  I 'm much more concerned about the backed - up .  The non - backed - up ,  yeah ,  i is cheap .  I mean , if we need to we can buy a disk , hang it off a s uh , workstation .  If it 's not backed - up the sysadmins don't care too much .  Yeah .  But that 's that 's that 's risky .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Yeah , that 's right .  Beep that out .  Yeah .  It 's really the back - up issue rather than the file server issue .  Yeah .  My understanding is , the issue isn't really the file server .  We could always put more disks on .  It 's the back - up system .  So  which is near saturation , apparently .  So .  Well , we 're alright for now  because the network 's so slow .  Yeah .  That was me .  I was the one who said it was not reliable .  The - they they wear out .  Yeah .  The the th  Yep .  Absolutely .  No .  Read and write don't hurt them too much unless you scratch them .  But the r the write once , and the read - writes , don't last .  So you don't wa you don't wanna put ir un reproduceable data on them .  Year or two .  Yep .  I I don't know many people who do it on CD .  I mean , they 're the most fo  They 're on CD , but they 're not tha that 's not the only source .  They have them on disk .  And they burn new ones every once in a while .  But if you go if you go k  Well ,  th th OK .  The the pressed ones last for  well , not forever ,  they 've been finding even those degrade .  But , uh , the burned ones  I mean , when I say two or three years what I 'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year .  On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years .  But , uh I I you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails .  And they do .  Um , if you have them professionally pressed , y you know , they 're good for decades .  I think th  um ,  we can already put them on tape .  And the tape is hi is very reliable .  So the the only issue is then if we need access to them .  So that 's fine f if we don't need access to them .  Oh .  So you 're just saying put them on C Ds for normal access .  Yeah .  I mean , you can do that  but that 's pretty annoying ,  because the C Ds are so slow .  Well , I mean , the C Ds are are an op  The the CD is an alternative to tape .  ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable .  So for archiving , we 'll just use tape .  Well , regardless  Well , first of all there was , um , a problem with the archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an or recursive chmod and chown ,  because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while ,  and I was just , doing a minus R star , not realizing that that caused it to be re - backed - up .  But normally you 're correct .  But even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated .  Sure , but we still have enough changed that the nightly back - ups are starting to take too long .  It has nothing to do with the meeting .  It 's just the general ICSI back - up system is becoming saturated .  Well , why don't you have this have a this conversation with Dave Johnson tha rather than with me ?  Actually , you know , we could do that just with the tape with the current tape .  I dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient .  You just run a program to restore them .  Yeah .

Bmr024.F,"So your your point is , and I think it 's a good one , that we could just get more disk and put it there .  Yeah .  That 's not a bad idea .  So once it 's on tape  I think that 's a good idea .  Uh  Well , I 'll talk to Dave , and and see what th how what the best way of doing that is .  There 's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you ,  and that 's probably the right way to do it .  Yep .  Well we 're g we 're gonna automate that .

Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set ,  can't you ?  Do you ?  What ?  And what 's the top frequency of each ?  Yeah .  Exp - one 's triangular , one 's trapezoidal .  So  Uh - huh .  Hmm .  OK .  So it 's not just losing some frequency range .  Yeah .  Uh . Just what we were talking about before , which is that I ported a Blass library to Absinthe ,  and then got got it working with fast - forward ,  and got a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle .  So , that 's pretty good .  Um , I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet ,  but there 's something going wrong  and it 's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be ,  and I 'm not sure why .  But I 'll keep working on it .  But the what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll Absinthe will be a good machine .  Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors .  There 're five now .  It can hold eight .  And it 's also five - fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz .  So .  I don't think so .  I think we 'd have to do all  Yep .  We 'd have to get a almost certainly have to get a , uh , Netfinity server .  They 're pretty pretty specialized .  July what ?  Early July ?

So , it we just and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring .  Um . So what we 've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring .

So that should be possible .  I mean that shouldn't be a problem .  Uh , so that was the one thing ,  and the other was that ,  um  What was the other problem ?  Oh !  That Thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his , um , speech detector .  Um , so that we could use , uh you know there wouldn't be so much hand labelling needed to , uh to generate training data for for the speech detector .  And I think you 're in the process of doing that .  So , you can you can  Mm - hmm .  Right .

Yeah .  Yeah .  Exactly  Do you wanna be a subject ?  We  Yeah .  That was one of our concerns .  You can  I shouldn't be saying this , but , you can just you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace .  I didn't say that .  I didn't say that .

Can't you just  you just put them on ?  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Mmm .  It 's like like dynamic ra DRAM .  One one thing I don't understand is , if you have the data if if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , uh , more than once .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be backed - up again .  OK .  So so then , if So so then , let 's  Right .  OK .  Right .  So , what if we buy , uh uh , what what do they call these , um high density ?  No , no .  Because this is maybe something that we can do without involving Dave , and and , putting more burden on him .  How about we buy , uh uh uh , one of these high density tape drives ?  And we put the data actually on non - backed - up disks .  And we do our own back - up once and for all all , and then and we don't have to bother this @ @ up ?  I dunno what the these tapes  uh ,  at some point these  I dunno .  What kind of tape drive is it ?  Is it is ?  Right .  But it might interfere with their back - up schedule ,  eh .  Right .  Mmm .  On an XH uh , X X whatever partition .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  OK .  Yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system .  Or is that a different tape robot ?  No , no .  See  Yeah , just give a dedi  Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and and and ask him "" can I use your tape robot ? "" ,  he will say , "" well that 's gonna screw up our back - up operation . ""  Oh , OK .  Alright .  Alright .  Good .  Well , it if he you have to put the data on a on a non - backed - up disk to begin with .  So that so that otherwise you don't you  Right .  Right .  Right .  OK .  OK .  SRI recognition ?  Oh .  Um . well ,  we have lots of them .  Uh , I dunno .  Chuck , do you have any any updates ?  Oh .  Well , you have to sa you have to tell people that you 're you 're doing you 're trying the tandem features .  A and I 'm still tinkering with the PLP features .  Right .  That was that was before I tried it on the females .  See , women are nothi are , trouble .  Right ?  As we all know .  So .  So so , when So I I had I ha  So , we had reached the point where  we had reached the point where , um , on the male portion of the development set , the , um or one of the development sets , I should say the , um the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features .  which are MFCC .  So , um , then I thought , "" Oh , great .  I 'll j I 'll just let 's make sure everything works on the females . ""  And the error rate you know , there was a three percent difference .  So ,  uh  No , actually there 's more training data .  No , no .  This is Hub - five .  Yeah .  Um , and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard .  So , uh so then um  Oh , and plus the the vocal tract length normalization didn't actually made things worse .  So something 's really seriously wrong .  So  Um  So So  That 's true .  Yeah .  Well , um  So  I just  d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the  So , most most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the uh , at about , uh , thirty - seven hundred , um , hertz .  Although , you know , normally , I mean , the channel goes to four four thousand .  Right ?  So , um  And that actually helped , uh uh , a little bit .  Um and it didn't hurt on the males either .  So , um  And I 'm now , uh , trying the  Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data .  So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test .  And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test .  And so the It now helps , if you do it only on the test ,  and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test ,  ","But but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be backed - up again .

Bmr024.I,"and then we 'll we 'll have , hopefully , even better results .  So  But there 's  It looks like there will still be some difference ,  maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females .  And so , um , you know , I 'm open to suggestions .  And it is true that the , uh that the you know , we are using the  But  it can't be just the VTL ,  because if you don't do VTL in both systems , uh , you know , the the females are considerably worse in the with the PLP features .  So there must be some something else going on .  Um , that ye overall , yes ,  but on this particular development test set , they 're actually a little worse .  But that 's beside the point .  We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features .  Mm - hmm .  It 's Baum - Welch training .  Um  Well , actually , we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations .  Uh , in this case four .  Um , which Eh , we used to do only three ,  and then we found out we can squeeze  And it was basically , we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side .  But you 're d  Right .  It might be that one more iteration would would help , but it 's sort of  you know .  No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really .  Um .  Yeah .  Well , yeah .  We can  Well , that 's that 's the easy one to check ,  because we save all the intermediate models  and we can  Um I uh I 'm actually re - optimizing them .  Although that hasn't shown to make a big difference .  Pruning ?  Pruning in the ?  I you mean did you see this in the SRI system ?  Um . Well , the likelihoods are  You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization .  And so these log probabilities , they aren't directly comparable  because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train .  So  W yeah .  I mean  Uh  We prune very conservatively .  I mean , as we saw with the meeting data , um we could probably tighten the pruning without really  So we we basically we have a very open beam .  Right .  Course .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Actually , there is the difference in that .  So , for the PLP features we use the triangular filter shapes .  And for the in the SRI front - end we use the trapezoidal one .  Well , now it 's the same .  It 's thirty thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz .  No , no .  But  Well  But  Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale .  And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters .  You can actually continuously vary it between the two .  And so I wen I swi I tried the trap eh , triangular ones .  And it did slightly worse , but it 's really a small difference .  So  Yeah , exactly .  So , it 's not  I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  So one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set .  So right now , we 're using a  I don't know ,  forty ?  I i it 's it 's eh it 's a f training set that 's about , um , you know , by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system .  So , some of these smoothing issues are over - fitting for that matter .  And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full whole hog .  And so , w so , just um so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set .  And so , we haven't done that yet .  Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch .  So we compute ,  um  So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have .  And and then we train from scratch .  So we com we do a , you know , w um We collect the uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train .  And then , from there we do ,  um  There 's a lot of ,  actually The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model .  Um .  You do a total of  First you do a context - independent PTM model .  Then you switch to a context  You do two iterations of that .  Then you do two iterations of of of context - dependent phonetically - tied mixtures .  And then from that you you do the you you go to a state - clustered model ,  and you do four iterations of that .  So there 's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models .  I don't think that  Hmm .  ","maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females .  We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features .  No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really .  So , for the PLP features we use the triangular filter shapes .  And for the in the SRI front - end we use the trapezoidal one .  ",
Bmr024.I,"We have never seen big differences .  Once I thought "" oh , I can Now I have these much better models .  I 'll re - generate my initial alignments .  Then I 'll get much better models at the end . ""  Made no difference whatsoever .  It 's I think it 's eh , i  the boot models are recur  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But there are no boot models , in fact .  You you 're not booting from initial models .  You 're booting from initial alignments .  That 's correct .  Yeah , but  But but but , what I 'm what I 'm saying is  So , we e w f w For a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a with the same front - end but with acoustic models that were , like , fifteen percent worse than what we use now .  And with a dict different dictionary with a considerably different dictionary , which was much less detailed and much less well - suited .  And so , then we switched to new boot alignments ,  which which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we 've made over two years in the system .  And , the result in the end was no different .  So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  Anyway , I I I should really reserve , uh , any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set , um , and until we 've seen the results with the with the VTL in training .  So .  Yeah .  Right .  And , uh , with this , I have to leave .  With this said .  Oh .  Oh !  Cool .  Mm - hmm .  A few more processors ?  How many are you shooting for ?  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  Can you mix t uh , processors of different speed ?  OK .  Oh , OK .  Maybe we can stick them in another system .  I dunno .  I see .  OK .  ",,
Bmr025.A,"I can do that quickly .  Um I hired several more transcribers ,  They 're making great progress .  Seve - several , several .

And I have uh so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea ,  and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes .  On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy .  So you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk .  And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the  but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage .  I do take notes ,  I mean , I could be taking notes on these things  and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings  but  I don't know .  Could Mm - hmm .  Well I did it one time  but um  u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe  by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards  and taking notes in some other interface .  Oh it 's la it 's useful ,  have a summary and high points .  Well .  Mm - hmm .  Well when when I d  OK .  w Mm - hmm .  There is an alternative .

But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too ,  doesn't it ?  I mean  But I mean , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition ,  right ?  OK .  I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  I mean  Oh , nicely put .  OK .  Yeah .

Mm - hmm .  Right .  OK .  So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones ,  then we talked about um some other stuff  which would basically be um showing off the the Transcriber interface itself  and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense ,  but but um ,  uh and part of that was showing off what the speech - non uh nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like .  Mm - hmm .  Well I think  at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that  cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it  and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point  pointing at something I don't know much about ,  so .

So we 've never used them .  Once ?  i  But  So it 's it 's um it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position .  And so you have time and position stuff stored  so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you 've written .  And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things ,  not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth  and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ?

Bmr025.B,"And then we did it once or twice and we sort of  probably chose the wrong scribe  but it was It 's uh  Yeah .  Summary .  I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later  and and and put some kind of summary or something  uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing ,  not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important .

But you could imagine ,  I mean , if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel  but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort ,  a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go .  I mean even buttons you could do ,  sort of ,  I mean , as you said .  Right .  The transfer function is less errorful ,  yes .  OK .  Alright .  This is  Yes , this is number two for me today .

Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this  but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content ,  they could just sort of make an X near that point  or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region  and they can then look at it .  So .  I know we haven't been using it  but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods  which you then get back in a transcript  so .  Right .  And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful ,  so .  Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ?  Would h I mean is there a big cau  just just in case we  even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do  but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure  but we could at least try it out .  Right .  Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting  but it might be a useful , neat part of the project  that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time  that happen that you just wanna make a note of ,  like what Jane was talking about  with some later browsing , just just as a convenience ,  even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute .  So what kind of input would you be ?  You 'd just be pressing like a a  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  that be good .  M  right .  That would be fine too .

Bmr025.H,"Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ?  Um  as a somewhat segue into the next topic , um could I get a hold of uh the data even if it 's not really corrected yet  just so I can get the data formats  and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ?  So can you just  Oh , it is .  OK .  Just So , "" transcripts "" is the sub - directory ?  OK .  So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those  rather than use the ones that are there .  Um and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made .  It 's this one .  Is my mike on ?  Yeah .  And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ?  OK , good .  Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it ,  especially for the information retrieval stuff .  Anything else on transcription status ?  OK .  Right , which uh  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data  and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end ,  so the front - end is the user interface  and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool .  And so I 've written some tools to convert everything into the right for file formats .  And the command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working .  So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for uh conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it ,  do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting ,  uh of hits .  Keywords .  Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything .  Um , right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools ,  but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either  So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ?  We have two tools that have already been written .  Um the SoftSound guys did a web - based one ,  um , which I haven't used , haven't looked at .  Dan says it 's pretty good  but it does mean you need to be running a web server .  And so it it 's pretty big and complex .  Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows  because it means porting the web server to Windows .  Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News  which I think looks great .  I think that 's a nice demo .  Um and that would be much easier to port to Windows .  And so I think that 's the way we should go .  Mm - hmm .  It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based  So it 's uh term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring .  Um and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing  how far apart they have to be and things like that .  So it it 's  i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that .  So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time  so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents .  Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search .  Um you have to do preindexing  and so that these tools do all that .  And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it  well uh to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings .  So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that .  On which tool ?  The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK  um you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits  and you can type on them and listen to them .  Click on them rather with a mouse .  Right , you 'd get  something  You you 'd get to listen to "" beep "" .  You couldn't get a video .  Right .  And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally  and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Um Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that  so I 'll work with him on it .  And it it 's looking pretty good ,  you know , the fact that I got the query system working .  So if we wanna just do a video - based one I think that 'll be easy .  If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work  because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's um ,  I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris .  So getting them to compile on Windows might be challenging .  So .  It certainly helps .  Um , I mean without those I wouldn't even attempt it .  But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer ,  so that the normal UNIX function calls all work .  Um ,  ","as a somewhat segue into the next topic , um could I get a hold of uh the data even if it 's not really corrected yet  just so I can get the data formats  and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ?  especially for the information retrieval stuff .

Bmr025.H,"But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf  and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't  and uh different compiler work - arounds and so on .  So the fact that um it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows .  Free BSD would probably be easier .  That 's true .  Actually you know I should check  because he did port it to SPRACHcore  so he might have done that already .  I 'll check at that  Yeah , right .  Right .  That 's right .  So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh uh , SoftSound guy , uh  Blanking on his name .  Do I mean Tony ?  I guess I do .  Or S or Steve Renals .  Which one do I mean ?  My brain is not working ,  I don't remember who I 've been corresponding with .  Then it 's Steve Renals .  So uh just getting documentation and uh and f and formats ,  so that 's all going pretty well ,  I think we 'll be OK with that .  Um  we have  Well , that 's a good point too .  I don't know .  Well this is one of the reasons  This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have uh Dave Gelbart Gelbart  Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing  because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff  and he 's more familiar with Tcl - TK than I am .  Well that 's Snack , not not Transcriber .  Yeah , yeah , I mean , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack .  And so my intention was just to base it on that .  And if it doesn't  Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so .  Yeah .  It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about  and having the search tools and so on .  We we can look into it ,  but  Yeah , I mean we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments ,  so uh  Um  My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system .  Right ?  The Windows system isn't any harder  because it it looks like a BSD system .  It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the "" include "" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different .  So I it might be a little easier  but it 's not gonna be a lot easier .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm ,  ranked .  This month .  Oh sorry , next month .  Today isn't June first ,  is it .  Um .  So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools  where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything  and I think that 's definitely the right way to go  because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools .  Um .  So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML  because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  I mean it works with Transcriber  but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  uh because it doesn't mark start and end .  Uh  Utterance .  So it 's implicit in in there  but you have to do a lot of processing to get it .  And so and also I 'd like to do the indirect time line business .  Um but regardless , I mean , w that 's something that you , me , and Jane can talk about later .  Um , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages  and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files ,  either uh information on users because the user database is that way  I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m uh various inf uh sorted information on individual meetings  and then also the transcripts .  And so l just let me know there  it 's mostly Java and Perl  but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable .

Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have .  I had told you guys about it  but  I mean this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text  because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things .  So .  Um if you use the Edit - key ,  or Key - edit  I think it 's Edit - key , command  Did I show you guys that ?  I did show it to you ,  but I think you both said "" no , you 'll just use text file "" .  Um it has it in there , a place to fill it in .

Bmr025.H,"Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings .  So .  Yep .

Yeah that 's cuz you kn  I I know why .  And then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under "" participants "" they were filled in under "" description "" .

Oh uh also I 'm working on another version of this tool ,  the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected .  And it 's not quite ready to go yet  because um it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not  because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off  and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking .

""  OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  Um I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup  and he pretty much said "" yeah , you could do that if you want ""  but he thought it was a bad idea .  In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing uh NW archive to copy it is a good idea  and we should do that and have it backed up .

But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that ,  that we 're getting a new backup system  and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK .  And uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings .  Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable .  The expanded files and things like that .  They take up a lot more room anyway .  Uh but we do need more disk .  Yeah .  And I I think I agree with him .  I mean his point was well taken that if we lose one of these we cannot get it back .  I don't think there was any other et cetera there .  Um unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain .  Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it  and that 's a multi - step procedure .  And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last .  So I think burning them for distribution is fine  but burning them for backup is not a good idea .  Cuz th they they fail after a couple years .  Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work .  Uh got an email from uh James Landay  who basically said "" if you 're not using them , could you return them ?

We we used them a couple times ,  but  Yeah , we have two .  Um .  My opinion on it is ,  first , I never take notes anyway  so I 'm not gonna use it ,  um and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with .  And then you can download it  and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things .  So i if you take notes it 's a great little device .  But I don't take notes ,  so .  Yep .  Yep , and then just sort of died out .  Yeah that 's right .  Yep .  Because that 's summary .  Right .  I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally  and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads  and so that means synchronizing the time  You know you want it pretty close  and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery  and so you  so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used ,  ","Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone ,  on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike ,  you actually have to say which one .

Bmr026.A,"OK , we 're on .  So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items ,  three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .  So . The uh first was transcription status .  Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?  Ugh !  C can I have a pen ?  Yep .  No , no .  We haven't done that process .  So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process .  Right .  Yep , sounds familiar .  Make sure it 's right .  Can you mail that out to the list ?  Oh , OK , OK .  Yeah , I haven't done that .  So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .  I 'll try to get to that .  OK .  So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about .  I 'm just gonna do it .  And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .  I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits .  And then bleep them out .  For the ones that we have .  Um  Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .  I mean that 's my intention .  Because the transcripts might not be right .  So you want people to be able to listen to them .  Oh , that 's a good point .  That 's a good point .  Yeah , it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .  Well , that was the other point .  Yep , that 's another agenda item .  So , uh  But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too .  Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say .  The back - end stuff is working out fine .  It 's more or less ready to go .  I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera  and also by the user ID .  So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well .  Uh The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer .  And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy .  So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .  But uh the back - end was pretty smooth .  So I think , we 'll have something .  It may not be as As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something .  Yeah .  Yeah , he he actually he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it .  So .  Oh well .  Um  Oh , cool .  For a demo ?  Yeah , sounds good .  So it might just be slides .  Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,  so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work .  Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ?  Oh .  Ah .  Patch .  Ugh !  We have  Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .  It 'd be easy enough to add that .  Again it 's it 's It 's more Tcl - T  So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it ,  but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do .  Yep .  But it it seems to me that I c  It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary .  So yo It seems to me you could do images .  Yeah , jus Yeah .  It just seems to me jus  Sure , but I don't think I You can do all that just statically in  Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's  And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again .  So , we 're doing OK on backed up .  We 're We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk .  So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical ,  but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .  And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space ,  but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once , in a lot of different ways .  Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers ,  so all of those need to be expanded ,  and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms ,  so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around .  Um And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it .  One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred  alright , excuse me  ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .  They came in but they 're not set up yet .  And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room ,  ","So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items ,  three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .

","This is a relatively short meeting of the Meeting Recorder group, with only a few agenda items. Transcription was discussed briefly because Jane was not present, however this appears to be progressing well in parallel with IBM. Web pages have been set up to show transcription status and to allow participants to approve transcripts. DARPA demos are progressing well with the back-end indexed to allow front-end filtering, and a potential demo ideas investigated which would use X Waves. Transcriber is now working for Windows, however live pitch contours may not work in the time available. Backed-up disk space is now fine, however temporary space is running out fast. "
Bmr026.A,"they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines .  And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .  Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott .  Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays .  Just put them in .  Sure .  Yeah .  Cuz the SUN uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives .  So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in .  Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions .  What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ?  Oh , I didn't know he had left already .  Oh , oh well .  You we need about a gig per meeting .  Alright !  What 's your computer 's name ?  So it And you have an X drives installed ?  OK .  And you 're o you 're offering ?  OK .  Which one was that , X G ?  X G ?  OK .  But that won't be getting any bigger ,  will it ?  Not not for long .  Yeah , it 's probably Probably only about four gig is on X on your X drive ,  but we 'll definitely take it up if you  Great .  OK , so that will get us through the next couple days .  Yep .  At least .  The "" more disk space "" button ?  Yep .  Half a gig .  For all of them .  I would like to .  Yep .  And put it where ?  Yep .  Wa - a I know what they want .  The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .  So they don't want to stack up external drives .  Um And then they want everything else in the machine room .  So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?  Right .  Yep .  Yep .  But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk .  And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system , rather than on new disk .  So .  Which  Yeah really .  Popcorn .  Yeah , it 's just It 's not on the net , so it 's a little awkward  It 's not  It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S  Yep .  And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net ,  but Who knows when that will happen ?  No , the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers .  So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere .  But Dave has to do all of them .  Oh my !  And that 's all I have .  This is the fifteenth ?  So just a week from tomorrow ?  OK .  I 'm interested .  Jane , I think .  No .  If we talked about it in this meeting .  The Nod off ?  Yeah , I would as I would guess .  Or just alternate the focus .  Yeah , so on even weeks have basic on data .  I am .  Oh sor  Well , except that we keep going for our full time .  Yeah .  Ugh .  I don't .  Let 's read digits and go .  Bridge .  OK ?  No , no that would be for next week .  Mmm .  Wow .  Just with ROVER ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , it 's pretty impressive .  We clearly gotta add a few more features , though .  No , uh front - end features .  You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra .  Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and  Cool .  Right .  I don't know .  I could also put in uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech .  It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close .  Yeah .  That 's right .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yep .  Try it .  You run it ?  Keep keep both versions ?  See which one 's better ?  I could make arguments either way .  You know , it 's  Sort of given up guessing .  Although , I mean we 've done it with When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse .  Which I 've never figured out .  I think it 's a bug .  Yep .  Yeah .  No  they were they were comparable .  They were very close .  That 's what I said .  Yep .  Right .  Ah yeah .  That 's another big difference .  I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .  Hello ?  Excuse me ?  Alright .  Wrong number .  Mm - hmm .  But not by a lot .  Vast majority is from the input unit .  Right , because you used the context windows  and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .  It 'll be faster .  We 're just waiting for you to leave .  Anything else ?  OK .

Bmr026.B,"Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  So that should have ma many fewer  And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,  right ?  So .  Yeah .  Yeah , well it certainly seems  Yeah .  Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's  Yeah .  You are going to  OK .  Oh  I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point .  He 's sort of been been volunteering for everything  and and uh  O K .  Finally said he was too busy .  I guess we reached it .  OK , so again , the issue is For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on ,  but  So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this  Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the  Yes .  You know , wh  Yeah .  So . Uh ,  no , we 're talking about on the computer  and and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,  we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have  and , the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent .  So I think For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it  so it 'd be a good thing to get in there .  But ,  um Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in to people .  Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics  It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them .  Did they come in ?  Oh .  Yeah .  Weren't we gonna get  Well , maybe it should get another rack .  But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something .  Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten ,  mightn't you ?  Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days ,  Uh , well , tonight .  I don't know .  I don't know what his schedule is .  I 'm just saying he 's gone .  You had an eighteen gigabyte drive .  We need  We need another gigaquad .  There should I d There should just be a b I should have a button .  Just press Press each meeting saying "" we need more disk space "" "" this week "" .  Skip the rest of the conversation .  And And how much does each meeting take ?  So - so So maybe there 's a hundred gig or something .  Or  I mean . Cuz we we have the uncompressed around also .  So it 's like  Yeah .  Well I mean it 's the they really are cheap .  I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them ,  but But uh , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks .  I mean it 's it 's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him .  And just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do .  And in my answer back was "" are you sure you just want one ? ""  So I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure "" well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months "" .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave ,  cuz it  Yeah .  No .  I think Dave Dave knows all these things , of course .  An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .  Well .  So .  But this this is a very specific question for me .  Basically , we can easily get one to four disks ,  I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it ,  it 's no big deal .  Uh , but the question is where they go ,  and I don't think we can solve that here ,  you just have to ask him .  Attach to  Yeah ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal .  If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's it 's jus every ever everybody everybody has a has  Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing .

I think I have a pretty good idea  but but um  Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll be having that that discussion with her .  Um . So .  Mm - hmm .  Think so ?

And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting .  But I I think that 's a great idea .  Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane when we get a chance , see what they think and  Yeah , and you 're you 're attending the uh the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best  you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two .  We are doing recognition in both of them .  So .  Uh .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So except I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation .  OK .  Sure , why not ?  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  An  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Including digits I gather , yeah .  A fifth of it is how much ?  Right .  But a fi a fifth is how much ?  Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was .  So .  Oh yeah  w  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah that was the interesting thing .  Because because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better ,  but but uh .  Well they been using TIMIT .  That  Uh . They they uh they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests  and and uh , um , and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT .  Uh But uh which So that 's what they 're they 're using now .  But but yeah certainly if we , um  If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was .  I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms .  So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .  Once we know , then the trainable parts of it it 'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through .  Yeah .  Sure .

Bmr026.B,"And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's That 's certainly one thing , yeah .  Uh . Yeah .  Well the other thing is , dipping deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before ,  uh it was I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .  When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh at the time .  Uh . And . Later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems  cuz they were self consistent  but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate .  Uh . But that was a that was a good good good way to start .  And we 're not quite that bad with our our Switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's ,  so  Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error .  And uh it was  I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for .  We never did really fix up the dictionary .  Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do  and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .  Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation  uh , we never did any  Yeah .  Yeah .  So we were  Yeah .  We were probably at least a factor or two off .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But I think again it 's  Yeah .  It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit .  Because our our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good .  He knows .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  It 'll still probably be worse .  I mean , it 's it 'd be context independent and so on .  But .  Uh , yeah .  I mean . I think I agree with Ad  I mean basically you would then You proceed with the embedded training .  It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway .  And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did .  Uh well . It depended on the task .  I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important  because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system .  Uh .  Right .  But I mean i  Yeah .  Was it ?  I don't think it was .  No .  Yeah .  Excuse me ?  Oh !  Um . No .  Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean and wi with the numbers OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better .  Yeah .  It just  But I But I would I would suspect that something that that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance  I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us .  I I would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from  Oh , wait a minute ,  and the other thing uh ,  sorry ,  it was the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .  So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference  and uh , one bac at least  Back at  Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors .  And if we 're we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system .  So so that 's another difference .  I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different different uh , um , training criterion  Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded uh embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .  But we don't know .  You gonna say something ?  Uh , how much training data ?  And how How many hours is that ?  Yeah .  Um . So . Uh . after run  Right .  So  At least a couple thousand hidden units .  I mean .  It 's it 's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more  but it it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .  You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand .  It 's m It 's more than  Oh let me think about it ,  but I think that that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns .  I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,  but it but but there is diminishing returns  and you 're doubling the amount of time .  Not by much .  Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 'll have a very tiny effect .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .  Uh . There 's uh  How bi how big  Let 's see .  What am I trying to think of ?  Right .  And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of of speech .  Oh .  So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .

Bmr026.D,"That 's our system .  Mmm .  Speaking  Hmm .  So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM  no ?  Oh .  Oh , OK .

Um and we want it You know , we need  The Again , we we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich  and get it transcribed and get it back .

Yeah .  OK , yeah .  Alrighty .  Mm - hmm .  Really ?  So is that  Because there 's some people um  It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at at SRI  because the um  we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the  Right .  Mmm .  I I wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along  We have ?  Oh .  Oh , OK .

Bmr026.D,"Uh . Uh , if you wanna put it that way .  Right .  I mean it it 's sort of I mean when when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've you know , I I 'm bored .

So so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there 's some time .  Um I jus So the latest result was that um  um yot I tested the uh the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for for this year 's Hub - five test set .  And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .  Yes .  Uh , well i there was a little bit of a  i overall .  They They were The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .  I mean definitely not significant .  And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .  So .  t  With N - best ROVER , which is like our new and improved version of ROVER .  Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm , uh c combine that .  Yeah .  And , the  And And so uh after I told the my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a  Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination .  Um , and , you know , why not ?  Uh . So .  Uh w what do you mean ?  More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?  Oh I mean  Yeah .  Well  Right .  So , we cou  Yeah .  That 's the the the  There 's one thing uh I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end  You know , if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems  and Um .  So . So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system  and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems  and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing .  So .  I I think so .  Yeah .  Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower  and so if  You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .  So .  Um Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely .  And then we had some results on digits , uh , with um  We We  So this was uh really really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments .  And so , uh .  But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits .  And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .  And you c  And  Not all of  No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .  The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .  A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something .  Right .  But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there  because we 're doing  You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits ,  which is only what  two hours something ?  So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps .  And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .  That 's e  That was e  Right , right .  Right .  Oh , yeah .  So we only for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone database .  Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data .  I mean , Wall Street Journal , uh , take one example .  But um .  So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than TI - digits .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .

Bmr026.D,"Well , that was that .  And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system  and You wanna You wanna see where that stands ?  An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's um that the phone set would change .  So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight  forty - eight phones ?  Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we 've been using so far .  And that that that will probably help , actually ,  because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um , um  Just  You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features .  And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three .  And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .  Right .  Exactly .  So so that was the other thing .  And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .  So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .  Right .  But then  And then something  Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features  uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .  Exactly .  Yeah .  So that would basically give us a , um , more hopefully a a better system  um because you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News  and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard  or s uh and  But he I think he d he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available .  And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as as the as ours is .  So .  And the dictionary made a huge difference .  Uh . We we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh to the dictionary about two years ago  which resulted in a uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard ,  which  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  Mmm .  But that w  Even that that number  Right .  And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data ,  right ?  Where the error rate now is in the twenties .  So , um .  That 's yet s  Right .  So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re uh  just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up .  Right ?  Because it 's a pretty good um indicator of that .  So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs before we go ahead and train up the uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system .  No .  Sure .  Not  But  Oh oh that 's a good question .  Yeah , we we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer  or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  OK .  Alright .  But But so I  Well but i  But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ?  Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got  Right .  That are from another  Right .  Right .  So you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ?  And then  Uh .  Hmm . Well , that might probably just  Hmm .  That was probably because your initial system I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's .  And you Um .  It wasn't ?  Really ?  That 's weird .  That 's That 's weird .  No I mean it 's weird that it did  I 'm sorry .  It 's w  It 's weird that it got worse .  Oh actually it 's not that weird  because we have seen  We have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  You mean with soft targets ?  Or ?  Sorry , I 'm sor  I missed  What What 's the key issue here ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Uh , I think that has about  Well i you 'd would be gender - dependent training ,  right ?  So So I think it 's uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .  Thirty hours per gender .  I I think so .  I 'll  It 's definitely less than a hundred  You know , it 's more like like thirty forty hours  something like that .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .

The group note that the annual report needs to be worked on for next week, and it is also suggested to hold recognition meetings separately, however these issues will be discussed in more detail at the next meeting.

Which means also we get feedback on if um , there 's something that they w that needs to be adjusted ,  because , I mean , these are very highly technical things .  I mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as I see it .  But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong .  So .  And the reason I liked it was because  was because it , um it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it .  Approve it and correct it .  And um .  So , you have it nicely set up so they email you  and , uh  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder .

I didn't mean to isolate them .  Yeah . Sorry .  It was it was not the best characterization .

That 's a little bit difficult .  Yeah .  Well . That 's true .

This is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure .  Um @ @ So , this is from one of the NSA meetings  and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was ,  and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to .  So ,  um . And now the first one .  "" OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting .  The last time , uh "" And the transcriber thought "" little too much ""  But , uh ,  really , um , it was "" we learned too much "" ,  which makes more sense syntactically as well .  Then  Oh , this that 's the convention for indicating uncertain .  So the transcriber was right .  You know , she was uncertain about that .  So she 's right to be uncertain .  And it 's also a g a good indication of the of that .  The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia  and she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers .  Uh , OK .  Um , next one .  Um . This was an interesting one .  So the original was "" So that 's not so Claudia 's not the bad master here "" ,  and then he laughs ,  but it really "" web master "" .  And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that .  So instead of "" split upon unknown "" , it 's "" split in principle "" .  No , no . These are these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings .  The transcribers transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version .  My my checked version , after I go through it .  Um , then you get down here .  Um .  Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms .  That 's the next example ,  the next one .  The , uh , version beyond this is  So instead of saying "" or "" ,  especially those words , "" also "" and "" oder "" and some other ones .  Those sneak in .  Um , the next one  S  Sorry , what ?  Discourse markers ?  Sure . Sure , sure , sure .  And it 's and it makes sense  cuz it 's , like , below this it 's a little subliminal there .  Um . OK , the next one ,  uh , this is a term .  The problem with terminology .  Description with th the transcriber has "" X as an advance "" .  But really it 's "" QS in advance "" .  I mean , I I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings .  OK , then you got ,  um , uh ,  instead of "" from something - or - other cards "" , it 's "" for multicast "" .  And instead of "" ANN system related "" , it 's "" end system related "" .  This was changed to an acronym initially  and it should shouldn't have been .  And then , you can see here "" GPS "" was misinterpreted .  It 's just totally understanda  This is this is a lot of jargon .  Um , and the final one ,  the transcriber had th "" in the core network itself  or the exit unknown ,  not the internet unknown "" .  And it it comes through as "" in the core network itself of the access provider ,  not the internet backbone core "" .  Now this is a lot of terminology .  And they 're generally extremely good ,  but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check  and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance  cuz the you know , there 're a lot of these in there .  No , actually no .  Huh - uh .  It 's jargon . Yeah .  I mean this is cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing .  And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent .  Well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval ,  cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , it 's , uh , uh  OK .  Exactly . That 's why we discussed that .  And then I also the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones  because of the problem of low gain in the originals .  And and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones ,  and actually I I mean , I I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice .  We 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets  but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task .

I mean , I would suggest we discuss  I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it ,  that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people ,  so that we have a uniform thing .  So , tha that 's a month ,  which is fine .  I mean , it seems  I mean ,  um ,  I I i I think that somebody might request something  even though we say that .

So I 'm not telling you what to decide .  I 'm just saying you should decide something ,  and then  Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth .  And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you .  So what I 'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough  and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere .  That 's all I 'm saying .  OK ?  It well , it well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be away  and , uh , you know , there 's , uh for any length of time that you uh , choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it .

So  If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it .  But the thing is that , you know , I I I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . We never really talked about that .  Yeah .  We certainly didn't talk , uh , about with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being made the , uh , uh , materials available .

Bmr027.B,"h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to  That was the kind of dispute I was making before .

And so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something  and they wouldn't actually hear from us ,  and then they find this thing is in there  and we 've already distributed it to someone .  So , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah ,  but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , um , then we haven't given them that .  I i i em email is enough .  Yeah .  I mean , I 've been through this  I mean , I 'm not a lawyer ,  but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now  so I I I I 'm pretty comfortable with that .  So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way ,  uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about  because uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . Cuz it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission .  Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it doesn't seem that  that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here .  So .  Right .  Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on .  So it 's unusual that that they , uh  Yeah .  So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it .  But , you know , hopefully we won't need to .  So we 'll we 'll see if we do or not .  Yeah . I think very few people will  and and and , you know , people people see long emails about things that they don't think is gonna be high priority , they typically , uh , don't don't read it , or half read it .

She was re she was referring to it as  I think this actually didn't just come from her ,  but this is what , uh , DARPA had asked for .  Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year .  But of course the fiscal year starts in October ,  so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July .  Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those .

And so someone whose machine is down or whatever  I mean , we have no  in internally we know that people are there ,  but we have no confirmation that they got the mail .  Well , then  It we 're hoping that doesn't happen ,  but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail  or  Right .  You 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end .  I mean , there 's no way to get around  I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work  except for an additional email just saying they got the email .  And maybe it 's better legally to wonder before  you know , a little bit earlier than  Or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you .  They probably forgot all about it .  Yeah .  That 's why you never open these things that come in the mail .  The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying "" yes , I will do it "" or "" yes , I got your email "" , they 're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it .  And of course we don't want them to bleep things out ,  but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd at al at all .  That 's how these mailing houses work .  So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work  because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses .  You know , an official OK from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email .

Whereas , I I mean , I would be much more likely myself ,  given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying "" you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it "" or whatever ,  rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it ,  and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late .

Well We haven't really started ,  but I thought we more we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week ,  so I thought we could do , uh  But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each .  So .  I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted .  Here we go .

I we don't My understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply .  We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want .  And so no reply is no changes .  Right .  Well  Yeah .

Well , the only thing I said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth .  I didn't give any other deadline .  So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , "" wow I suddenly found something "" , we 'll delete it from our record .  We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released .  What else can we do ?  If someone says "" hey , look , I found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and I want it removed "" . What can we do ?  We have to remove it .  Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ?  No . OK , well why don't you do that  and then make comments on what you want me to change ?

That will happen .  That will absolutely happen .  Because people don't read their email ,  or they 'll read and say "" I don't care about that ,  I 'm not gonna delete anything ""  and they don just won't reply to it .  No .  We have what they put on the speaker form ,  which was just generic contact information .  Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago .  And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again .  So .  Well  OK .

"
Bmr028.A,"And we 're going .  So the only status ite  well , first of all we h haven't decided whether we 're Meeting Recorder data issues , or recognition this week .  I think we were recognition .  You only sent me one thing , which was demo status .  And asking which one we were on this week .  So should we simply assert that this week we are recognition , and next week data issues ,  and ?  And , uh  So , I think what we should probably do is any quick , small stuff we can do every week .  So like Morgan asked about the demo status .  We can go ahead and talk about that a little bit .  And then do then alternate in more depth .  OK .  Actually , I may not be here either .  So  I gotta double check the dates .  But , anyway .  So , uh , demo status .  First of all , I did a little thing for Liz with the Transcriber tool , that , um first of all , it uses the forced alignments ,  so that the words appear , uh , in their own segments , rather than in long in long chunks .  She said that that she thought that was a much better idea for the other stuff she 's working on .  Um  And that works fine  except it 's even slower to load .  It 's already pretty slow to load .  Yeah . Yep .  And the Transcriber tool is just not very good n at at that .  Correct .  Yeah , it 's just writing conversion tools from the format that the aligner  Actually th he did a SRT file for it .  And then just back into Transcriber Transcriber format .  Yeah . So my my decision was , for the first pass for this demo that Liz was talking about I decided that I would do , um , only enough to get it working , as opposed to any coding .  And so the other thing I sh she wanted to display the stylized F zeroes , I think they 're called ?  Is that right ?  And , uh  So what I did is I just took the file with those in it , converted it so that it looks like an audio file .  And , so you s it shows that instead of the wavefile .  And so that that 's working ,  and I think it actually looks pretty good .  Um , I 'd like someone who 's more familiar with it to look at it  because when I was looking at it , we seemed to have lots of stuff going on when no one 's saying anything .  Ah .  No . I the audio file you can specify any sampling rate .  And so I s I specified instead of , you know , sixteen thousand or eight thousand , I specified a hundred .  Um ,  and , the only problem with that is that there 's a bug in Transcriber ,  that if the sample rate is too low , when it tries to compute the shape file , it fails .  Um , and crashes .  Um  But the solution to that is just , set the option so it doesn't compute the shape file , and it will work  and the only problem with that is you can't , uh , zoom out on it .  You can zoom in , but not out .  The shape file is  If you think about a wavefile , sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen .  So what Transcriber does , is it computes a another thing to display based on the waveform .  And it displays it at  And it allows you to show m many different resolutions .  So there 's a little user interface component that lets you sh select the resolution .  And if you don't compute the wavefile , you can't zoom out .  You can't get a larger view of it .  But you can zoom in .  Um  And that 's alright ,  because at at a hundred samples that 's already pretty far out .  And , uh so I think it looks pretty good ,  but I 'll let Liz look at it and see what she thinks .  OK .  We should If you were having problems with the words , we should figure out why .  OK .  You c you clip that part over your ear .  Anyway . We 'll all watch Liz play with the mike .  Um  Uh , no . It doesn't have to ,  but that that 's I find that 's the only way to wear it .  Is that the bud 's in the ear and that the link is over it .  But , so , anyway , I think that looks pretty good .  The only the only other thing we might wanna do with that is be able to display more than one waveform .  And that actually shouldn't be too slow ,  uh , because it 's much lower resolution than a full waveform .  The problem with it is just it does require coding .  And so it would be much better to get , uh , Dave Gelbart to do that than me ,  because he 's familiar with the code ,  and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly .  Oh , OK .  Mm - hmm .  I understand what you mean .  Right .  Ps  But for the demo maybe it doesn't matter .  I 'm not sure whether you wanna do the demo live anyway ,  or just screen shots of what we have .  The problem with doing it live is it takes so long to load , that , um  Um , w I was talking to Dave Gelbart about that  ",,
Bmr028.A,"and apparently it 's not actually the parsing of the XML raw  that going from the XML to an internal t tree structure is pretty fast .  But then it walks the tree to assemble its dat internal data structures  and that 's slow .  Uh , no .  But what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then .  And then displays all the user interface components .  Yes .  A new transcript .  Or audio file .  Well , actually the audio files are pretty fast , too .  Right . The only problem with that is if anything goes wrong or if you wanna switch from one thing to another .  That 's true . We could just subset it .  That 's a good idea .  That 's actually probably the right thing to do .  You know , just take f ten minutes instead of an hour and a half .  Yeah .  Yeah . So that that 's actually the definitely the way to do it .  That 's a good idea .  Yeah , if there are any problems .  Yeah , I mean , even five minutes is probably enough .  That 's what I did .  Yeah .  Yeah . I mean , just ask Just come by my office .  I can show you as well .  Right .  And for the information retrieval , uh , Don has been working on that .  So .  It looks like it  Great .  Yeah . So I think for the L stuff Liz was talking about , we have something that 'll work now .  And Liz can look at it and see if she wants anything else .  Maybe we can work on doing displaying multiple or displaying one and playing back the other .  Um , I think I 'd h I 'd have to ask Dave .  I did it once before  and it was just so slow to scroll , that I gave up .  But , the advantage is that these things are much lower sampling rate .  And so then it might be alright .  Tcl .  I mean , we could check .  I don't think they do .  Um , there was actually a Java back - end that apparently is actually a little faster .  It generates byte code .  But , uh  Yeah .  Well , e everything is faster than Tcl - TK .  It 's a string substitution language , basically .  I should probably beep that out in case John Osterhaut ever listens .  But  Well , it is wonderful .  It is , for prototyping and user interface .  It 's just really the language is awful .  Beep ,  y right .  But let me tell you how I really feel .  Yep .  Oh , that 's right .  Then the other issue related to that is data release .  If we wanna show this in public , it should be releas  So , I , uh , haven't gotten any other replies from the original email asking for approval .  So I sent out another set this morning .  And , uh , we 'll see if we get any responses .  Very good .  Did you notice I put in the filter ?  Go ahead .  There 's a link there that now says if you want to search by filter by a regular expression , you can .  I put that in just for you .  It 's actually an arbitrary arbitrary regular expression .  But if you search your name , you 'll get all of the things you said and any time anyone said your name .  So .  Correct .  It 's hard to find .  Hmm .  Yep .  You really do have to sort of r  Yeah . That 's right .  And it demonstrates why it doesn't work ,  because you really wanna go acro more than one meeting .  And you need a better user interface for displaying the results .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah , really .  That 's right . Th - we do have that bi nice marker is that , n n  because we all know we 're being recorded , whenever anyone says anything like that , we then have a conversation about bleeping it out .  So .  Yep .  Um . Oh . And also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker forms .  Specifically in the NSA ones ,  and I noticed that when I tried to , uh uh , generate the transcripts for NSA . That there are a few with no speaker forms .  And so , uh , I have a I sent out yet another this morning , which I think makes six total emails that I 've sent to these people ,  and so I think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them .  Nope .  Well , if I could find phone numbers , that would certainly work .  But .  Yeah , that 's a good idea .  I 'll ask her if she can con track some of them down .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I didn't actually see who they all were .  Um , a couple of them were , like , people at IBM who were here for one of the IBM meetings  and one a guy from SRI who was at one of the SRI meetings .  And so , uh , those might be harder to track down .  Yep .  I mean , they they were people who didn't have accounts at ICSI ,  so they 're they 're harder to find .  Am I sure about what ?  There were other people also .  There were other c other people also who didn't ha fill out the speaker forms , in addition to the N S  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  ",,

Well , m my feeling about that  is p is p  Well , OK . That 's the point .  So it 's Jane that we have to coordinate that through .  Uh , what I was gonna say is , as soon as possible , and I 'm willing to not work for an hour to get it done .  Uh , but  Because when Abbott 's  Yeah , right .  Because when Abbott is down you can't work .  But , uh , I think the per the people it disrupts the most are the transcribers .  OK .  So early next week .  And just as long as we have a little warning .  Uh , just not during that time when it 's down .  But that it should be down for an hour .  Right .  Well , no , we can store them here .

Quicknet is a very nice stream - based library ,  so without too much effort , once he has the classes written we can incorporate it into all the standard tools .  So .  And at some point , I 'd like to get back to , uh , porting Quicknet to the multiprocessor Linux box .  You know , I I have forward passes working , but I haven't done training yet .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . That 's right .  Well , that 's the nice thing about it , is that i since it 's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special .  So . I mean that would be a fine use for b for that machine .  Five more processors .  Yep .  Oh , yeah . That 's really hard .  It 's not determined .  I think the first pass is throw out words which are overlapped .  That would be a good first pass .  Just ignore everything that has any overlap .  Right .  Yep .  Yeah , eighty percent .  Yeah .  Well , but for a  But , for s for scoring , you can do it or not do it as you choose .  So .

So ch chea try to cheat in the same way that you 're doing with the close - talking .  Yeah , right .  Yeah .  Just do or a free ri  Yeah .  Yeah . They 're all gender - dependent .  So we would have to at least do that .  And pick whichever 's better .  S does the clustering ? Do you give it sort of a target number of clusters ? Or is it ? adapted in some way ?  Mm - hmm .  That 's what I 'm just thinking one of the big differences with Broadcast News and these meetings is we have m many fewer participants .  Speaker ID .  Yeah .  Well , there 're different ways of thinking about it .  I mean that that would be true if w you had a meeting situation with multiple mikes .  But if you only had your PDA sitting in front of you  And you have more than one mike .  Oh , so just from clustering . You might be able to cluster it better because of that .  From mike .  Yeah .  And transfer functions .  Well , I think there 're lots of lots of ways of doing it .  Yeah . That 's an interesting  It 's a big difference .  Yeah .  Well , humans are really good at that  transfer function through the head , and things like that .  So you know , even if you only have one ear , you can still get get good transfers .  So  Yeah .  Yeah .  Something .  Yeah .  Yeah . So it 'd be cool to see if it helped .  ",,
Bmr028.A,"That would be ft quick ,  since I think he did it in Matlab .  Yep .  Can't you export C from Matlab ,  or is that Mathematica ?  Well , so just take the inverse and you 're fine .  So that 's a speech detector .  That 's great .  Yeah . Just subtract that  subtract that from the original signal and you 're set .  Noise estimate .  Signal to noise .  That 's great .  I guess that 's why Herve always talks about using the priors as one of the mixtures in in his all - ways combos .  But still  So if you run er , your recognizer with all probabilities equal , what do you get out ?  Probably garbage .  I bet the pruning  The pruning probably prunes everything out .  Yeah . That 's right .  Different .  But they are channelized ones , though ?  Right . Cuz you haven't done any training .  Right . Cuz we 're not doing it for training .  Right . So it 's really it would be really easy to re - do it .  Yeah . It 'd be interesting just to see i how much it changes .  I bet it wouldn't change a lot .  We can take we can have a pool .  That 's just what I was thinking .  Yep . I we know about it .  Tran  Transcriber will export STM .  In case you care .  OK .  Right .  Right . But but If the segments change , that won't work .  Well , I mean , what happens if you break one segment into two ?  Suddenly the don they don't match at all and you can't line them up anymore .  Right .  Does STM do it per word , or por per utterance ?  Th - what I thought .  Alright .  And then it does also some  Within the segment .  Yep .  I see .  One percent .  All al  All we mean by that is that we 're giving the recognizer more information than it would have if you were running it raw ,  over a meeting that no person has ever listened to or transcribed .  It is . Yep .  It 's us it 's using information you wouldn't normally have .  So .  Hmm .  We 're not de - legitimizing the data .  We 're de - legitimizing the experiment .  We 're not saying that the data is cheating data .  We 're saying th we are cheating by using this data .  Because normally you wouldn't have that data available .  Shoot .  Just the clip .  It 's p it it really is part of the jargon .  Well  That 's what I was saying .  Uh , and it 's used for a lot of different types of data .  So , segment whether you have segmentation or not , is it male or female or not Um , do you know the signal - to - noise ?  Like , that 's another one I see all the time , where you assume it 's known .  And you say it 's cheating because you don't actually compute it .  N Right .  Same cheating .  Mm - hmm .  It 's not even really negative .  Fine - tune little bits .  Hmm .  Did you read the paper ?  What what this w  Right . What would this be like if w it were perfect ?  If this component were perfect ?  Hmm .  It 's too hard , usually .  It 's not pejorative at all .  But , it 's not pejorative towards the data .  It 's pejorative towards  It 's pejorative to o ourselves .  Right ?  To say "" I am cheating in this experiment "" is not saying that the data is bad .  It 's saying that my experiment is bad .  Yep .  Oh , right . I haven't gotten back to that recently .  But  I assume you 're saying you want me to get back to it .  Hmm .  Well  Well , you can , but you 'll lose a lot of data .  But , I mean , that doesn't really help  because often the recording person isn't in the room .  So , what are you gonna do ?  I mean it will w the person if you 're looking up at the board and I disable the screensaver , you will see that the mike is off ,  but that doesn't necessarily help .  So  Mm - hmm .  It 's just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking .  So .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Well , we should be getting new equipment in , so we don't have to use the earplug any more .  It 's your hair .  I mean , y d you you can do sort of a check ,  but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and , um , someone not talking .  No .  Little bit of noise .  I use a threshold .  If it 's below a particular value , it it flashes yellow .  So as I eh but it 's not perfect .  Yeah , probably .  I mean , this is the reason why I haven't gotten back to it , is cuz my first pass at it didn't really work  because all the mikes have different noise levels .  And so I have to do something a little more clever .  Yep . Yep .  Yep .  Yep .  Yeah . There 's eh the s the standard deviation of the signal gives you a good clue .  I mean , if that is too low , then you can be pretty sure that it 's , uh , empty .  Right . Exactly .  Uh - huh .  Is there a ?  Far - field .  Yeah .  ",,
Bmr028.A,"Well , we 'll just We 'll we 'll just have to note those .  Well , I I I think we can't throw away that data ,  cuz otherwise we 'll end up with very few meetings .  But  Do we have a ?  I 'm sorry for interrupting .  Do we have an EDU meeting at four ?  OK . Great .  Good .  Cuz otherwise I was gonna say we have to cancel .  A simultaneous digit . OK .  Everyone ready ?  S reading simultaneous digits ? Three ! Two ! One !  And  ",,
Bmr028.B,"I think that 's correct .  Yeah .  So do you have to pad that out ? Uh , so that it looks like it 's an eight kilohertz sampled thing ?  Or ?  Mmm .  Seems like you should be able to spawn that off into a background process ,  because not everything is displayed in that tree at once .  Right ?  Right .  Seems like you wanna ass  Did you actually look through your transcripts ?  Or you just approved them all .  I just approved all mine .  I didn't look at them .  That 's a compliment to you .  He said it 's hard to find things you say wrong .  Find everything that should be bleeped .  I haven't done anything .  I was  I was away for a couple of days .  So .  I haven't done a  What does the two - second threshold mean ?  Ah .  I wouldn't think that the language model would continue across two seconds .  Wel - He had a problem .  Right ?  H he did , and then it didn't work ,  and  I didn't hear anything after that .  Yeah . He he didn't say he hasn't said anything to me about it .  Yeah . I think  Yeah . He  They 're stored on Popcorn .  Uh  Um , I 'm rebuilding the net that we 're gonna use for the tandem stuff .  And so what I 'm doing is , um , putting in the stream reader into the Quicknet libraries for the SRI feature files .  An - Which is the right way to do it .  I mean , when we did our first experiments and I was , uh , creating SRI feature files from the ICSI front - end , I just had perl scripts , you know , and hacked a bunch of stuff together  just to get it going .  But the r the right way to do it is to integrate it in with the ICSI tools .  And so ,  that 's what I 'm doing now .  And so once I get that done , then I 'll generate the P - files I need .  Cuz we already have the feature files in the SRI format .  So what I need to do is , make it so that the the Quicknet stuff can read those .  And , uh  It 's both .  There 's a there 's an input stream and an output stream .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So , then it 's t uh , tandem experiments after that ?  We don't have too many . We just have that just have a few Linux machin  Whatever the language model says .  D Do you think the battery ran out ?  Or ?  ",,
Bmr028.C,"Wha - what was on the list ? Th - the  I mean , I sent you a couple things ,  although I don't remember them .  Right .  Ah . That was the second thing .  Right . Right .  By the way , I 'll I I won't be here next Thursday .  I 'll be out of town .  But  What 's a shape file ?  Mm - hmm .  I see .  This bud 's for  No .  I don't know .  U I 'm I 'm confused .  Uh , is is this downloading something that happens once ?  And and then when you d display different things , it 's fine ?  So , in that case  Well , a new meeting , a transcript . Right .  But but i i for but for  for presentation in , uh Uh I wouldn't be  Go wrong ?  I see . Yeah .  Oh ! Oh , you 're downloading a whole meeting .  Oh , yeah that @ @ .  Yeah .  And then still do it ahead of time ,  but then at least you 're covered if if , uh if there 's a problem .  OK . Well , I 'm gonna start working on this the week after next ,  so that 's the point when I 'll need to look more carefully at what y what what you guys have .  Right . The week after th th  The Monday the week after next is July second ,  which is the first day I get back .  So  Well , uh , I 'm giving a talk on July sixteenth .  It 's a Mon - Monday in four weeks ?  Three weeks ?  It 's always exciting to hear that Java 's faster than something .  Yeah .  Beep .  We 're all entitled to our opinions here .  Um . Yeah . So it 's Yeah . I think it must be three and a half weeks .  Uh , cuz July The the meeting is July sixteenth through eighteenth .  And , uh , my talk 's the first day .  So .  I 'm flying out there the Sunday before .  So . Um  I guess , you know , it 'd be desirable if , a week ahead of that , we basically had thought we had it ,  which would allow a week for  re - iterating .  Yeah . Pretty much .  Yeah .  I th I saw that .  And it 's it 's case insensitive ?  Yeah .  So , we have our first information retrieval example .  It 's a regular expression  searcher .  Yeah .  Yeah .  You wanna say , "" Where are al where Find all the contentious things I said . ""  Yeah .  Um Right .  Has has has Joachim Sokol replied ?  Or ?  He 's not around , is the only problem .  Yeah . Otherwise , it 'd be a good idea .  Yeah . He popped in .  But , I mean , he 's basically gone .  Yeah .  Yeah . And and tell her You know . Tell her your specific problem .  She 'll fix  He 's right there . Yeah .  Yeah .  I i in in other meetings .  Yeah .  Well , SRI people , easy to f find .  And , uh , IBM people , also . Just let us know .  I mean  Just we certainly have their email .  Right .  Uh . I know they 're in .  And , uh But I don't know . I think he was Wasn't he asking about ?  Well , there was an issue .  He wanted to take it down .  And then he tried  Wel  Markham probably needs u H he probably needs us to approve another time to take things down .  Right ?  In order to do that ?  I thought he I thought he said in that mail that he would need to take it down another time .  So I think he  Well , no . I think he wanted u us to tell him when .  Yeah . I 'm sure he 'd love to  Fortunately , Markham 's not a transcriber .  But , um  "" I might not work . ""  "" I 'm I 'm willing to not work for an hour . ""  I know you 're willing to not work for an hour .  But , I th  I  So , OK , it sounds like Markham should almost decide when he wants to do it , and tell us , as long as  Yeah .  We store we store our data on Popcorn .  That 's really great .  I was just thinking we store our data on Popcorn .  How many how many institutes can you say do that ?  OK .  Uh , g megabytes and mega many megabytes , too .  Um , what what , uh ?  So uh , what what 's on your queue for for recognition experiments ?  Let 's talk about that for a second , maybe .  What what was on his queue for recognition experiments ?  Mm - hmm .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Oh , I know what it was  Um . Yeah . U um  Some  Yeah .  Um , I think it would be ne neat at some point in this to do , um , a recognition , uh , pass on one of the PZM mikes for these s same meetings that you 've been gi n gi bi  I mean , it 's gonna be terrible ,  but , you know , we we just don't know how terrible .  And  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . Cuz you have a set of scores about that ,  so maybe then , that wouldn't be so bad .  Oh .  Yeah .  ",,
Bmr028.C,"But that 'd be a hell of a lot better than what we do with just these .  And  and and , again , if you rule out the overlap , you have some numbers for that ,  cuz that 's yet another  But , I I 'm just concerned , of course , about that  Cuz you have scores for that for the other case .  And  We just don't know how bad it will be .  I mean , one of the things that Dave was noticing we were talking this morning is that i it seems like and we do don't know this in detail , but it seems like you 're getting a lot from the channel adaptation , the speaker adaptation , and so forth .  Um . So you are , already , in that recognizer , doing something that is likely to affect , uh , the the far - field microphone , uh , formant .  So , it may not  I mean , it 's gonna be bad ,  but , uh , it may not be , like , "" won't decode "" kind of bad .  It might might only be that it goes from forty percent to eighty , or something like that .  I want us to assume the exac whatever it was you assumed when you did the other the the close mike .  Oh , I 'm  But you 're saying for this For the adaptation , you mean .  Right .  I  I have  I I have a suggestion .  Do the simplest thing first .  Because we 're gonna want to know that anyway .  In other words , if you d  No . It 's No . It 's even simpler thing than that , is just that you don't know .  Yeah .  Yeah . Because you can get a number uh , for that with the other as well .  Right ?  You can turn those things off .  Right ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . And then put it in correctly and see how much that helps .  I mean , I was just thinking , do the one that 's easiest first ,  because you wanna know how much that 's helping you in these cases anyhow .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . If you don't have one more than one mike , you don't have a very good handle on location .  That 's it 's not enough .  Mmm .  Yeah .  But , say , if if you had a a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace , then sitting there , then it would Its its response to him would be about the same as the response to him , and so on .  Mm - hmm .  I see .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But Anyway , I I 'd it 'd be neat to have that ,  because you know we 've been at this for a little while  and we don't have have any results yet with with conversational speech at a distance .  So , um  We should at least get a first one .  Um , and the other thing This would kind of be a Hail Mary ,  but but , uh Uh , Dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits ,  and , you know , and so with then it 'd be , you know , just throw that in and see .  Yeah .  Uh , well , he can do it in something else .  But , I mean you know , it 's  Um  Actually , we 're experimenting with phase stuff now ,  and and , uh , thi this , uh first result he got , uh , was really great .  It actually , uh uh didn't exactly eliminate the reverberation ,  but it completely got rid of the speech .  Yeah . Well , I was thinking that .  So , it 's  That 's  You think I didn't s tell him that ?  No . I got pretty excited ,  because it completely got rid of the speech .  So , I was thinking "" well , so ,  you know , it could be useful for lots of things "" .  So , we have to  What ?  Well , we have to sort of check that out .  That 's  Yeah .  Yeah .  Reminds me of when th when Herve and I were first playing with c uh , context - dependent things for nets ,  and and at one point we took out the speech input ,  so we only had priors , and our performance went up .  S Yeah .  Well , of course it was a bug .  But , I mean , it 's it 's a but it was pretty f f It was pretty funny anyway .  So that 's how it was generated .  Uh , but cheating is is p  Sure . But chea but cheating is is is pretty commonly used to mean this .  It really is  Yeah .  Yeah . I i i i  I it 's i  It 's even more than that .  I think it it really gives a very strong perspective , that you know that what you were doing is not an un - biased experiment .  If you don't say that , then people think "" oh , they did that and they threw that , but that doesn't represent what would happen in the real world "" .  But if you say "" we did a n cheating experiment "" , which is really the standard way you 'd say it , it says you deliberately put in a piece of me information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something .  Just as part as your process .  So it 's I d I don't know ,  I  i  ",,
Bmr028.C,"Maybe . I I 've heard this at ICSLP for years and years and years , though .  I mean , it 's it 's pretty pretty common . People say this .  Yeah .  Yeah . In pattern recognition , or in  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah . It 's machine machine experiments .  Um , I mean , w when when the , uh , the neural net w uh wave hit in the mid - eighties ,  and by the late eighties there were uh , we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets .  It was really hot .  Everybody thought it would do everything .  Um , and a really common error that people were making was , they were just reporting their , uh uh , classification results on the data that they were training on .  And so I think it was it was it was very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say "" hey , I know I 'm doing something that isn't kosher "" .  And to make it really clear that they knew it .  So that was , I think , why why it became a popular term .  But it isn't bootstrapping .  Uh , it 's it 's really cheating .  It 's just ng  Yeah . Yeah .  But it 's cheating in a way that 's pril It 's it 's announcing to everybody "" hey , I 'm cheating , by doing this . ""  It 's saying so it 's all above the table .  I 'm actually using this other thing .  That 's that 's that 's the reason .  Bootstrapping would imply it was actually legitimate in some kind of way .  But  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Anyway .  It has some shock value .  Which is part of why it 's used .  Uh - huh .  But it 's also is  Right .  No , no . It has I don't think you 're saying the data is cheating .  I think you 're saying "" in my experiment , I cheated in this way "" .  I mean , another is what Liz was talking about , how in the Switchboard tests in all the Switchboard tests we 've been g doing , we 've been making the same er uh , same uh , uh , standard using the same standard way of of getting the data to test on .  Which means that we weren't actually running it on on , uh , on data that had had no speech .  And , in a sense , that was cheating .  So i so it it 's it 's a good wake - up call if people "" well , we have this performance but you have to keep in mind , we 're doing we 're we 're not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way .  But , I 'll convince you that that it 's still important for you to listen to what I have to say next because of this and this . ""  And so it 's just a way of putting it all out on the table , uh , as opposed to  Yeah .  Yeah . Sure .  Yeah .  In  In the multi - band experiments , in the first one , we really wanted to find out , "" what if you knew which band was really noisy ? ""  I mean , suppose you just know that .  And then then , even if you know that , can that help you ?  I mean , what can what strategy can you do , to do well without that particular band in the spectrum ?  And so that was important to know as a baseline .  And and then , once you knew that , then s you go "" well , now how do I know that that 's noisy ? ""  And and and , uh  But , y you know , I I should also say that there 's a lot of It 's not just the word "" cheating "" . But there 's lots of other things that we talk about , which , as soon as you go outside of your narrow little group , it gets very , very confusing to people .  And I i i i  Well , the example I was thinking of , also , was this w thing that that Herve and and Hynek and I made about , uh , increasing the error rate .  And , so we we did a number of papers , and talks , and so forth about , uh w uh , i the the virtues of increasing the error rate .  OK .  And I mean , and the whole point of it was , not that it was good to increase your error rate , but it was good to be willing to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky things , and trying Because there 's this notion of a local minimum , that if you just have some system that 's very complex ,  and you t you you turn some knobs to try to make it better and better , you 'll never get out of this local minimum .  You have to be willing to jump to something that 's quite different .  And the first time you jump to something quite different , or maybe the first ten times or a hundred times you do , it 's gonna be much much worse ,  because you 've optimized the other system .  So the effect the immediate effect is gonna be to increase your error rate .  And so it was we had a couple papers like "" Towards increasing the error rate in speech "" and and so on .  ",,
Bmr028.C,"And we really did get feedback from a few people , some of whom were , you know , fairly senior , that that , um , "" Well , you know , you sh you you c We 're c really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate . ""  And , uh , and we go we thought "" Oh , come on . ""  But .  That 's  we weren't .  That 's why we increased the error rate .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  But  Yeah .  Anyway , it 's colloquial ,  an and and , uh , it 's it 's interesting to hear that that someone coming from a different direction it s it sounds the way it sounds to you .  But but , uh , I I 'd never heard that before .  So , so i so , that 's interesting .  Mm - hmm .  Just so it doesn't when the microphone 's dead , it doesn't put out zeros ?  Or ?  Mm - hmm .  Johnson noise ?  Yeah .  Yeah , but there 's  There 's tea , also , though .  So , maybe we should maybe we should do a , uh , simultaneous digits digits read . In the interest of of getting the snacks .  Oh , you never have ?  Oh , it 's a treat .  OK .  OK , another successful babble .  ",,
Bmr028.D,"Yeah . It 's more segments ?  Or ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah . Th - that 's what I did for for my talk .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Huh .  Yep . Yep .  Yeah . Just Yeah . Just smooth the the output of the of the detector .  Yeah .  Yep .  Or you can Yeah . You can use the one with one second or whatever .  I I I There 's no not much difference between the the one - second and the two - second one .  And I think wouldn't it be better to to have a little longer sequences for the recognizer ?  B eh because of the language model ? As sometimes it happens that that it cuts off within a s  Yeah . But , we can be sure that as Or we can be er not not totally sure ,  but we can be somehow sure that there is nothing not no speech between those .  So , it it  I think i it doesn't  It 's the same as in the the smoother for the IBM thing .  Yeah .  So . Yeah .  So .  But Yeah . But but the the chunks are already sh i in general , are short .  So I I t I think it would be better to have to have more of them concatenated together , in order to have better language model  or language modeling .  I don't know .  Yeah .  Do that .  Yeah .  Yeah . But but y there 's there 's really not much difference between the one - second and the two - second .  So just take the one the one - second one .  I I 'm not too afraid ab about that as  w when there when there would be something some background speech or something there wo there would be a a chunk in another channel ,  and when there is s something in between , I con I I do not concatenate them .  It 's just when there is when they are sequentially and  So . I wou I would use th  Yep .  No .  We could  Mmm .  Yep .  Oops !  Yeah .  Mmm .  But d  do you have gender - dependent models ?  A Are the models gender - dependent ?  So  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . Some of these things are captured by Yeah . Um , by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever  you find in the channels ,  and  But  Yep . Yep . Yeah . Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah . Sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together ,  and  Yeah . Yeah .  Yep .  I don't think so .  ",,
Bmr028.E,"Yeah . It 's slow .  Yeah . The linear fit .  That 's just background speech .  Yeah .  So .  We 're talking about We 're talking about that demo .  Yeah . Did it ?  Yeah . It migh  It 'd be nice if we can do , like , a quick hack ,  just so we can play the audio file , too .  Um , with th with the display .  Like , even if we I think that even if we didn't display the waveform , it might be better to , rather , play the waveform than display it .  I mean , like , if we were to choose I don't know , if I were to choose between one or the other , I 'd rather have it played .  And then displayed .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . So , it 's coming along .  Um  Just hacking Dan 's code and m stepping through it .  But , I think it 's close .  And we should be there pretty soon ,  with at least , like at least with , you know , being able to search over c certain amount of meetings ,  just , like , really basic stuff .  Just asking fo looking for a word , and looking through a bunch of different meetings .  And if we have time , I 'll also add , you know , like , choosing which speakers you wanna include , and stuff .  But  So , is the end of the month still the the d ?  OK .  OK .  Morgan , when 's the demo ?  OK .  For realizing we don't ?  Mm - hmm .  Sure .  I still have , like , probably six , seven , eight gig on my disk .  Yeah .  Whoa !  Yea  Hmm .

NSA - one and NSA - three ?  We 're talking about those ?  Oh , oh . I see . OK . Fine .  But I knew everybody in the NSA meetings .  So th I 'm sure that we have , uh , fresh , you know , information on them .  Good . OK .  I bet I know who that was .  Yeah .  Well , you know , uh , I All I need to do is mail , um send them m a mail like two days in advance so they can schedule their time .  I did that with the last outage . I j I wrote to them letting them know that this w  was not , um  Yeah .  This is on Popcorn ? Or ?  This is on Popcorn or something ?  Yeah ? OK .  That 's very good .  What was the question ?  OK .  Ooo .  I don't like that term .  I don't like that term .  I don't like that term .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm . Interesting .  Wow .  That 's interesting .  Did it get rid of other stuff , too , though ?  Did it get rid of other stuff besides the speech ?  OK .  Wow . Interesting .  Wow .  Wow . Interesting .  Hmm .  I wanna ask , um So , you know that the data I ' v I have upgraded it considerably .  So I 've probably made I probably corrected something like ,  well , s  It 's really a substantial amount of things that I 've caught , changed um , added to it .  Including a lot of , uh , backchannels .  So , when you 're d running things , if you run it on the old  So . If you if you run it on the new version , then the numbers will be um , and you compare it to the to runs on the old version , then you 're gonna end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case .  As of February ?  So a l Like the HLT paper ?  OK . Well , so long as you have the same baseline , then you 'll be able to tell .  So long as i so long as it 's the same baseline you 'll be able to tell .  But but I 'm just gonn I 'm just saying that if you were to compare that with running that on the new data , that it would be an a more optimistic outcome .  Yeah .  Mmm . I did .  That sounds great .  Yeah . I mean , t y I was thinking , th the other day , that this is not just conversational speech .  The fact that is has so much technological jargon in it . I it makes it u considerably harder to , um me e e e to transcribe and to to double check and all those things .  So , I think you 're gonna find a substantial gain in terms of the word ac accuracy .  So long as those words are in your vocabulary .  Well , all of them are . All of our all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them . But we know what those words are .  I mean , I don't know how you get them into the vocabulary ,  but it would seem @ @  Now , I have to I have to I really need to , uh , raise a question about the term "" cheating "" .  OK ?  And the reason is , um , if I understand that , "" cheating "" is a term which is used to apply for basically what all of linguistics corpus linguistics does , and what what my transcribers are doing and what I do , which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark things in the data .  Like the transcription ,  like the words that are actually there .  OK . I mean , that that part is OK .  But I but I do wonder sometimes if it might be possible to use a term that 's a little bit less evaluative , like , um , "" hand - marked "" .  OK . I guess what I 'm I 'm thinking , is just in if uh , when these are presented in an inte interdisciplinary context , it might be nice to add that explanation ?  Cuz otherwise it sounds like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology ?  ",,
Bmr028.F,"Cuz it sounds like it sort of devalues the the , um , all other approach , which is to to put those distinctions in .  They can do experiments .  Yeah , it just seems like , you know , i if it were "" bootstrapping "" , or if it were I mean , there are other ways to maybe get the point across .  Hu - Well . OK .  OK .  OK . Alright .  Well , I I think  OK .  OK . OK .  Does seem to me that it that it carries over some baggage with it . That , uh , i that  I can understand it in context as you described it .  But , it it seems to me that u um , it does import some negative evaluation , that , um , would maybe not be good if  It has shock value ,  and  to the wr to the wrong audience , I think that that might be t a negative shock .  Yeah . We started with hand - marked data , or with , uh , t you know , hand - transcribed data ,  or  Yeah .  Did you break the microphone ?  Nnn . OK .  OK . Well , I feel better now .  Thank you very much .  The trouble is , that  you know , I understand it in that context ,  but it but it is almost resentful .  It 's almost like , you know , resentful of the data , resentful of the , um , the hard work that 's going into preparing the data  is  OK .  OK . OK .  Mmm .  Oh , interesting .  I didn't know that .  Huh !  Uh - huh !  OK .  Oh , sure . Terminology is always context dependent .  No question about it .  It 's just that it seems like the the point without the negative evaluation would be  However , you know , if i I understand your point . That it th it has a long tradition in this field  I didn't realize .  And is used  This is interesting what what Adam said about it being used also for a bunch of other , uh , dimensions .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Interesting .  Interesting .  Huh !  Yeah .  Yeah .  Interesting .  Mm - hmm .  Well . The term itself is .  You know ?  But but it And it 's pejorative with respect to a certain purpose .  I understand .  I I wanted to raise the issue .  Yeah .  Anyway .  OK . That 's interesting . OK .  Well , I wanted to raise the issue ,  and um ,  I I , uh I appreciate the discussion .  I wanted to ask one other question which is a different matter ,  which is with respect to , um , this thing that you 've been r working on for the recording monitoring script ?  So . The idea You had this script that you 're working on , to be sure that the microphone values are in are kept in ?  OK . OK .  Cuz , y you know  Well , I was just wondering if i i  Because I I am finding that , um , in double checking , I 've run across , u um , one data set where the microphone was off early on ,  and then two other speakers their microphones went off later .  And this is out of , like , seven speakers .  So out of seven speakers , four microphones Y you know , basically , three three microphones bak basically flaked ,  which makes it hard for the data to be used for all possible purposes .  That 's what I think .  I think the two that flaked late , I think it was the battery .  But , you know , if the script could , um , you know , alert the recording person to that  I mean , I don't know if there 's a way to replace a battery , if it happens in the middle of a meeting .  Maybe that 's hopeless anyway .  But  Oh , I see .  OK . Then I guess that raises the question of , uh , whether we should screen the data before they get transcribed .  Because , although I think that the data are still useful in terms of providing content ,  and and that , I know that having three out of seven microphones out of commission during some part of the meeting restricts the , uh , usefulness of the data for other purposes .  And maybe you don't wanna have it  I actually think that Thilo 's n in a in a k a You know , when you do the pre - segmenter and you and you run across troubles He he runs across s some of these that are  So , we have some part of that .  I c  Well , there the And the other aspect of it is , um , that , when the microphone is not well - adjusted , then y i i even if it 's not a lapel mike , you can get lapel mike type behavior .  Cuz I 'm I 'm expecting , for example , with this , that you 're gonna end up , you know , picking up other peoples ' signals .  Yeah . I mean , it 's just you know , the microphone is intended for certain adjustments .  The only argument for doing so would be with reference to the content . Content maps .  Uh but mayb maybe then it should be done in the old original way ,  w instead of channelizing and having the , uh , uh , you know , elaborate coding of the backchannels .  ",,
Bmr028.F,"And actually , an an alternative to even doing that level of transcription would be to have a transcriber listen and and m you know , maybe just  Oh , I don't know if a transcr uh  Well , someone who 's associated with the meeting could have , like , a summary of points handled in the meeting .  You know , maybe if we could pay one person who knows that subject matter to do an outline of the meeting 's content .  Instead of losing the content altogether .  I guess the troub trouble in my mind is that it that it 's not a very neat corpus  if you say "" these data are available ,  but these are imperfect ,  because of the f you know , the batteries flaked . ""  And we have so many .  We have such a backlog . I mean , to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meetings , it would be nice to not have energies diverted .  That 's fine .  Oh , good question .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yep . Yep .  ",,
Bmr028.H,"Yeah . Tried that , and it died .  Great !  I I got the wavefile  but  Sorry . I got the wavefile ,  but I couldn't get the words yet .  But the the wavefile part looks looks good .

But it is  I did wanna say that , um  No !  No ! No !  I just figured you p  Oh , my gosh .  OK .  Terrific .  Well , since you didn't answer the emai  So there was a q question I had asked Adam whether it 's possible to search only for your own name your own utterances ,  so that you know you don't have to go through the whole meeting ,  and Um ,  and I didn't hear back .  So I thought "" OK . It 's probably too hard .  He 's overloaded .  I won't say anything .  I 'll just do it "" .  Great .  OK . So , anyway I looked at everybody else 's stu  Good .  So th  That 's great .  That 's great .  Uh Well  I sort of spot - checked .  I was trying to remember  I couldn't find the the keywords for things that I thought I had said wrong .  So .  That makes it g  It 's hard to find anything that you say in these .  Great .  Well , thanks for the filter .  Uh , it 's really useful , tha  Cuz if you 're only at part of a meeting , or something  Yeah !  That 's actually Well , it 's useful .  But this helps a lot .  Great . Thanks .  Right .  We  Yeah . You can search for "" beep "" or "" bleep "" .  In somebody else 's turn .  Yeah .  We 're sort of in a stage where we 're uh , Don 's going through getting some of the next meetings that Jane s has .  And , uh , you know , creating a second database .  So we haven't actually run anything yet .  We need to get a critical mass for that .  And check the segmentations .  Yeah .  Great .  A What do you mean , a different pause threshold ?  Do you mean a ?  Yeah .  No , it 's not bad .  That 's good .  i ye Yeah . th u  I th I think that 's g that 's good .  It 's it 's no more than six words . So Roughly . On average .  That 's pretty good , I think .  It 's better than a  Yeah .  Well , yeah . Y you do , becau  Yeah . I think it 's better .  The longer is better .  There 's there 's th  There 's a l there 's a lot of these cases just like now , where I c people say "" uh uh "" when they 're trying to ta  and there 's about a half - second pause to a second in between and then another word ,  and it 's much better if we can keep those together , I think .  You know , you just fake the format that you take as input with the synch times to a new set of synch times ,  and  Oh .  And I have I have like another un - backed I ha have another six gig , which Jeremy , if you 're not using , can on XA .  To you .  How about during the picnic ?  Sorry . Beep .  You 're really dedicated , if you 're No matter how you parse that one .  So that means we can't , um , save meeting data either .  Right ?  So it just can't so we can't have two meetings in a row where the first meeting 's during that hour .  That 's all I meant .  That that 's happening , like , today .  Temporarily .  Well , no . I mea I mean , the fir  Oh , jus OK .  n Run all our jobs on your machines .  Yeah .  Ye - It 's also an interesting problem to come up with the reference .  So , the reference file for the relative times at which  So  Well , i it 's an interesting question , because I was thinking "" well you can force align the transcriber transcripts , and then of course , you try to merge them in time .  But how do you score ? ""  I mean it 's just an interesting problem .  ",,
Bmr028.H,"Right . I mean , there 's a whole sort of dis  Right . We Right .  But there 's a whole interesting discussion ,  cuz of course the alignments are not perfect either ,  and so um . In fact , we actually don't have a a p  I mean , it it 's worth trying .  I  Right . Right .  Oh , I see . You mean when only one person is talki  Yes . We could we could try tha  Right .  Right . Exactly .  Yeah . We we should try  Do you assume you know the speaker when you do this ?  Well , th r Well , there , there 's only one person who it can be ,  because they own that microphone .  I 'm just wondering There 's  No - It 's not a pro  Right . And  R right . But in terms of for norm  for adaptation . Right .  You know , do you do a supervised adaptation ?  Ye - All of these adaptations ha  assume that the same person  Yeah .  N Well . I was just aski  Actually , the s Those are two  So , wait , the simplest thing is you cheat , saying  Oh , you m y totally unadapted .  Uh . Right .  Yeah .  i i  No . You can  You can use a speaker eh  What about gender detection ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . So . You can r  No . You can run both .  And you can s  The other thing is that you actually have direction here .  So , unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones , like The right way to do this I guess , w you know , in the future would be , well , in general , Thilo 's sitting there , and this PZM is gonna You know , he 's roughly in that location .  Well , any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they 're not moving around too much .  W well , you have distance , and you have  I mean , that , um , Jane 's i n The pickup of Adam on this mike is gonna be different than me , in terms of energy and so forth over the whole meeting .  You might get some clustering from the speaker and some of it from the characteristics of the distance ,  and  Right . Exactly .  They 're both picked up in the clustering , I guess .  Or to just do the clustering , knowing that you 're capturing both .  It 's just that the kind of clustering we 've done before hasn't had that , uh , distance factor , or location factor in it in the same way .  And so we 're not really modeling it directly .  If somebody does , we sh maybe we add that  because I think it would be a pretty big difference .  When you listen , you can sort of tell where people are ,  not which s you know , side ,  but  Right . Even with one microphone .  Right . So our our clustering is not gonna be intelligent that way .  It 's just gonna pick up whatever energy difference , or whatever , is  OK .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  F Sorry .  For these meetings ?  Right . They 're somewhere in between January and late March , or something like that ?  N  N  They 're meetings that are now channelized , but they were not from  Yeah . We haven't a modified the recognizer at all .  So , actually , um , at some point we should update and rescore everything with , you know , the corrected transcripts ,  just to h  Sometimes the changes are , um , cases where the recognizer would get it wrong anyway ,  cuz it was some word that we didn't have in the vocabulary ,  or  But it does help to get the backchannels back in , and things like that .  Would that ? Doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment ?  I mean , I don't think that 's har I hardly ever see that .  I think most of them are pretty good .  Oh , you mean you would need to re - run the recognition .  I mean , if you re - ran the recognition , then you just run it  Oh , I see .  If you wanna use the old  You can actually never , though , really infer what you would get with a different  You know ? It 's it 's probably more fair to re - run the whole th re - run that .  Uh , in other words , it 's not really a scoring script problem .  It 's  Y Yeah . Yeah .  You It 'll sort of work , but it 's not exactly what you would maybe get from recognition .  You never know .  Well , you c You you s  You can  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well , it definitely helps with , um , forced alignment , too ,  because , you know , whe when we know the the the true words and we 're adding them to the vocabulary and training a language model and so forth for future meetings , especially the like , the front - end meetings or meetings with a lot of jargon in them , that is not represented in Switchboard or CallHome , then it then it really helps .  So  Yeah .  It I guess it It 's been around for a long time ,  and it it 's sort of , um Because it 's so strong a word , people don't take it that seriously ,  in It 's not negatively viewed .  ",,
Bmr028.H,"It just really means  Actually , Jane is right .  Like , in conversation analysis , I 've never heard people use this ,  because they 're not using an automatic system .  So , it really  Right . I 'm j Well ,  you can do experiments ,  but the it 's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box .  And it 's not a very smart system .  It it only knows what we give it .  And if w If it knows more than we would really give it when it runs , we call it cheating .  But it 's  Yeah , it 's f only used in a community that does some type of computational modeling ,  I think . It 's really not used in any kind of community doing experiments on human perception ,  or  You know . So she certainly can define it .  Yeah . I thi I think to the wrong audience , I agree that , um , p  to the wrong audie we should just explain what it what it means here , and that it 's a common term ,  and  we 're  Yeah .  Hmm . The first time I heard that , I I thought , you know , the same thing  and I guess you ju after a while it becomes almost a It 's a bu bit of a a humbling thing when somebody says that .  If they get good results but we were cheating on this feature because we took it for granted even though we can't really assume that , then it 's actually the opposite .  It 's  Well , it 's it 's  Actually , I think of cheating as a way to do some work , where you can't address all of the computational tasks .  Like , if we wanna study , um , speaker habits , but we can't do speaker detection .  But we wanna assume Let 's say , we know this is Jane and we know this is Chuck ,  even though automatically to look at the habits , we would need to also first figure that out .  But we can sort of cheat on that factor  because it 's somebody else 's research .  And then we just  So it 's Then we wanna make a proof of concept for  If someone else  Right . Eh or w But we really can't work on that problem .  We don't have time ,  we 're not interested , or w whatever  And so you you assume it 's given  because it 's , um you wanna go forward with your research , and assume that you have that information .  So ,  I guess if I don't ever think of it as negative . More like , it 's something we 're not building .  Yeah .  I I think that 's a really good idea .  Because for all kinds of studies , we don't really enjoy meetings where some of the where the signal 's going off at times .  It just makes it hard to study any kind of parameters .  So ,  if there 's a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all , it 'd be much better to go to another meeting , I think .  I 've already written some notes here ,  so I  Um , right . Uh  OK .  But it 's my ear .  I 'm sure it 's something wrong with my head ,  but  Um , actually , is there a way , though , to use whatever you 're using for background noise to check post hoc that a microphone was constantly on ?  I mean  Uh , like this o  But then how are y how are you detecting during a meeting ?  But is it better than nothing ?  Cuz it would really be  Right .  But you could  So , you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting , in the sense that , you know , not everyone as you just said , you won't be there .  And then if we find any problems , have the transcribers listen and  I really think it 's better not to transcribe a meeting that 's gonna have problems once you 've spent all this effort .  Yeah . Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I 'd mu We 're I 'd much rather have , you know , meetings that have all the channels ,  even if we had to skip a meeting or something ,  just for all these other purposes .  So .  Yeah .  Right . But may just  Right . There but there 's a shortage of trans transcription power .  Yeah .  You know what ?  They can their four o ' clock cancelled ,  and they 're starting at four twenty ,  and I 'll set up at four fifteen .  Yeah .  Yeah . So you 'll have si  You have to plug your ears or just prepare not to laugh .  ",,
Bmr028.I,"Oh .  Yeah . That 's great .  Is that because the transcripts get longer ?  The f transcript file gets longer ?  But th but that 's that 's n  You didn't have to change the software for that yet .  Right ?  It 's just formatting the right kind of , uh , XML ?  Mm - hmm . OK .  Oh , good . That 's very good . OK .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Cool .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  So this the this uh , the sluggishness of the loading is all due to the parsing of the XML format .  Right ?  Hmm .  Mmm .  But d y  No . Whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript .  Right .  You just have to have the thing running before you open your laptop .  Just make shorter files .  Yeah .  You missed that part .  So If if raw speed is the problem This thing is written in Tcl .  Right ?  Y I mean , John Osterhaut , uh Y you know , he started his own company based on Tcl stuff ,  and maybe they have the native code compiler or something .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Oh , darn .  I haven't done that yet .  Er OK .  Stalk them @ @ at their  Like in the morning , when I leave for work .  Cold calling at lunch time ? Uh , dinner time , I mean .  Chuck , you wanna talk about recognition ?  However , I just got an email from Thilo saying that we are ready to run  I mean , we have segmentations for the old meetings that are from his segmenter ,  and so  You you had three different versions , with different , like , pause thresholds between the segments ?  Right . And you recommended using the one with two s maximum of two seconds ?  But two s  Mm - hmm .  I mean , the only advantage to using the longer threshold would be that you run less risk of missing some some speech .  Right ?  But two seconds is pretty long .  So  Hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Mmm .  I think two seconds mmm  I would maybe go with one second .  I don't know , it 's a  See what the length distribution is .  Yeah .  Really ?  Uh bu I 'm I 'm I 'm just scared that with two seconds you get you get , um you you get false recognitions .  You 're gonna Yeah , you 're gonna hurt yourself occasionally by having missing the language model context .  But you might hurt yourself more by having misrecognitions due to background speech , or , uh , y noise , or whatever .  Oh , I see . Then Oh , I see . OK .  Oh , right . Oh , that 's  Mm - hmm . OK . Sure .  We can try them all and see which works better .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK . So so we need to split the waveforms , then .  Or do you already have them split up ?  No , you don't .  Right ?  So so , I guess Don would need your help to to create a new set of split , uh , meetings .  If  Right .  But th  Oh , yeah . There 's that pressure .  Oops . I 'm sorry .

I is that independent  or related to also being able to write out the , uh , feature file i in the SRI format  f r  Oh , OK . So then you could use , um You could use , um uh , like Feacalc and s just specify as an output format  the the  Oh , OK .  Th - t I 'm just ignorant about the sof software architecture of this thing .  Uh - huh .  Oh , cool .  Great .  So , b speaking of Linux . So Th - there 's some i impetus at , um , SRI to actually u u p th uh , build support Linux as a platform .  So .  What that means is , once we have , uh , everything running on Linux we can  also use a Li - eh  Yeah . Exac  I mean , if you can't use all the processors on whatever machine , we 'll help you with that .  Right . Exactly .  Yeah .  So it 's just , uh  Uh . Yeah .  Or if uh , you know , in the future , if Linux machines become like way cheaper , than , uh , you know , Solaris machines , then you know , that wouldn't be a reason not to use Linux anymore .  So .  For the meeting ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Right .  Right .  Right .  Right .  You just di you just  Right .  Yeah . That that becomes another problem , actually .  n s  So , d s so fo not well , for everything .  For s for f even feature normalization , for , uh , vocal tract length estimation ,  all of all of these assume you know who 's speaking .  So ,  you would have to do a speaker segmentation first on the far - field micropho signal .  You mean you wanna cheat .  No . If i i  OK . We g we 're gonna bleep that out .  You mean you do you don't do all those normalizations .  Um , actually We don't have any models .  ",,
Bmr028.I,"Um , you can  Um  A actually , it 's that it 's it 's We would have to retrain models that are not that have none of that stuff , uh , in it .  But actually we could  We can just run it , assuming that it 's all one speaker , basically .  And see what happens .  Yeah .  Actually  Actually , no . Th - th  Sorry .  Yeah .  No , actually  No , actually , what Here 's here 's what we would usually do u under these circumstances .  We would actually we would run some sort of segmentation .  Thilo 's is as good as any , probably .  Um , and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segments , to  and and put the similar ones into bins that would be sort of pseudo - speakers .  And then we would do our standard processing on these pseudo - speakers .  And that turns out to work very well on Broadcast News , SPINE  those types of tasks , where you don't have the speaker segmentation given to you .  Um , you can either do it by target number or by some measure of dissimilarity that you use as a threshold .  Right .  Well , you can do You can you can you can do certain normalizations like , you know , gain control ,  uh , before you do the clustering to rule out those those types of things .  Mmm .  OK . That would be fun fun to try .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Hmm .  Oh , yeah . Then we should  Well , first you have to filter the whole training set and retrain .  Oh .  That would solve all of our problems .  Wouldn't it ?  Hmm .  Right . Then you can do like an you can estimate the the noise estimates .  Right ? Yeah .  Mmm  Hmm .  Yeah .  You get out Switchboard .  That 's just the lang the language model .  Ha  Yeah . So we have this new speaker adaptation .  Um  A b Oh , it 's a s sort of feature normalization  t  uh , like f speaker adaptation ,  which , uh , which I wr which I wrote about in the last status report ,  which seems to be helping about a percent and a half on Hub - five .  So , um . We haven't tried that yet on the meetings ,  uh , but hopefully it 'll help there , too .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , we we have a frozen we do all our experiments with a frozen version of the transcripts as of , I don't know  A a as of  no , a little  I don't know .  When when did we grab the transcripts ?  The  We 're talking about which which version we 're using for evaluating the recognition .  Which version of the transcripts .  No , no .  Yeah . O obviously . Yeah .  The uh , the other thing is  Th - the the  Hmm . And  Well , the and the other thing is , it takes only a a minute to rescore all the old outputs with  If you had new transcripts , then we j we just re rescore the old  Sorry ?  W we just We save  Well , the the  Right .  So , I I The thing is , when  Right .  So , whenever the Right now , the s the scoring is based on segments .  Um , which is not great  because , for instance  So so , the the other way to do the scoring is using a a NIST format called STM . S  uh , Segment Time Marked ,  where  So , um , I have to convert the , uh , transcripts into this format , and then the scoring program actually looks at the times .  And , uh , you know , it You can have a different segmentation in your recognizer output than in your references ,  and it will still do the right thing .  So , that 's what we need to basically , uh , to  Hmm ?  Oh .  Well . But then there 's other changes .  So . I mean , there 's other  We we strip away a lot of the mark - up , uh , in the transcripts ,  which , you know , isn't relevant to the scoring of the speech recognition output .  So  No . I mean if suppo  I I assume you also changed some boundaries .  Right ?  So , if we want to use new transcripts with a different segmentation , then we can't use them in the current way we do scoring .  We have to m m switch to this o  No . We have to r  There 's a difference  Right . Right .  That 's true .  No . But if you w just want to see what  Like , suppose you fixed some typ No , Jane fixed some typos and you wanna see what effect does that have on the word error ,  then we can f we c  No , but that 's what the pr  Well , that 's what I 'm saying .  You can line them up based on the times .  So the scoring program with if you give it an STM reference file , it will actually compare the words based on their time marks .  So therefore , you can ,  um  It 's per utterance ,  but it it allows As long as you hypothesize the word in the right segment in the reference , it gives you credit for that .  So it does a it does a word alignment , like you have to do for scoring ,  but it constrains the words to lie within the t the time bins of the reference .  ",,
Bmr028.I,"And fo for you to get a credit for it .  So .  So so , it 's it should be just a straightforward re - formatting issue of the references .  So .  It 's a it 's a technical term .

Bmr029.A,"OK .  That 's true .  Hub - five .  Well , that 's only male .  We could only jus just do the male only  right ?  Or will we run into trouble when we g ?  Yeah .  That 's what I was thinking .  Yeah .  S  So We - Yo - So , one thing I was wondering is , did you already do that middle one or should we re - do that one , too ?  You didn't do that . OK .  Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say next .  We hafta cut the , uh  W s so is Morgan , is the plan to just pick one of the far - field mikes ?  Uh  Do you know when he 'll have the the comparison ?  Oh , OK .  So cuz I don't think the new data will be ready , uh , for a couple days may probably .  So ,  the training .  Yeah .  I think it 's that one .  Right ? F .  F .  Yeah , that 's it .  That 's F .  It 's the second nearest the machine room .  OK . So , uh , I just want to make sure I understand what we need to run .  Um  Let 's see .  So , it 's  OK , so if we 're talking about  Let 's let 's assume that we 're gonna use the new segmentations .  We need to , um , run recognition o just looking at the no overlap column .  Basically , we have to d r do recognitions for all three of those cases .  Right ?  Um , because we 're gonna be using the just the male , uh , model  short training set for the male .  So we need to have results for all three of those ,  even though we have  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  And if we 're re - doing the baseline anyways , it it it would be OK .  Right ? I mean To to just limit ourselves to a smaller  How long would it take to run recognition , if we did that ?  I mean , is is it like a day or is it a few hours or  roughly ?  For  yeah , let 's say we just did the Meeting Recorder meetings for our test set .  Oh , really .  I didn't realize each test took that long .  Four hours per meeting .  Wow .  S six hour test set .  Six meetings . OK .  OK . So Alright . So if we got a list of the , uh , segmentations for these five Meeting Recorder meetings , we could start , uh , the first two experiments going right away , using the short male models .  So , you could get those going while Dave is , um , creating waveforms for the r retraining the short male models .  Right . OK . OK .  And then  OK . So , do we w also want to run that bottom experiment without retraining the short male models on his thing ?  Did you want that ?  Or ?  OK . So , we 'll save that .  Well , i it  Well , on a more basic level , also , it means that that third experiment , there are actually two differences between the other experiments ,  not one .  So , it 's hard to know  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  On the far - field ?  Mm - hmm .  So when you said you were gonna start that top one , were you gonna use the new segmentations ?  OK .  Right . OK .  Can we ?  So , does that mean you turn off speaker normalization when you run it ? Or you just let it do what it would do , an ?  Mm - hmm .  You 'll have email .  Right ?  So ?  Segmentation ?  S So , um .  I don't want you to have to be burdened with doing a lot of stuff .  What what can I do to ?  Y y you said it would be easy for you to do that top one there ,  and I guess Don can do the segmentations of the , uh , channel F ?  I mean , I can certainly help with , uh , retraining the short male models ,  uh , once we have the new data .  The top one is done . I c  I can re - do the next one .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . Sure .  Yeah , the the bottom one would b just be a matter of pointing it at a new set of files and kicking it off ,  so that would be re  I mean , th not the bottom one ,  but the middle one  would be really easy once you 've got the top one going .  I could do that .  OK . So I guess I just need to get Don to , uh  Mm - hmm .  To keep it the same but j just change them all to channel F ?  Right . Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  OK .  OK .  And so that 's something that Don would do  right ?  when he creates these .  OK . OK .  So will you talk to him about that ,  or do you want me to talk to him ?  OK .  And then the bottom one in terms of the test will be ?  Uh  That will just be a copy of the one above it , except for different models from training .  Ah . OK .  So , we need to run ?  OK .  Well , once we have the new , uh  ",,
Bmr029.A,"Well , once I do that , uh , second experiment , we 'll have the , um , files ,  and I can give you those to to process .  So , do you create this continuous stream from the individual utterance files ?  Yeah .  OK . I 'm gonna I 'll check with , um , Markham ,  and see what happened with the the disks .  He went to put those on a couple of weeks ago  and something  Oh , OK . I 'll ask David , then .  You haven't seen new disks pop up ,  have you ?  OK .  Yeah .  Well , he went to put them on  Yeah .  He went to put them on and then something happened .  And he sent around a note saying "" Oh , uh , it didn't work , and we 'll have to schedule another time . ""  And then ,  didn't see  nothing happened .  So  I 'll check with David about that .  OK .  So , basically , Dave , so y for you to get your processing going , you need the list of the , uh , wave  Well , I guess it 'll dep  you 'll you 'll we 'll need to get the segmentations .  Figure out whether we 're using the new or the old from Don .  And then ,  uh ,  from that you need the from the segmentations you 'll have the list of wavefiles that the short , uh , set is trained on .  And then you 'll need disk space .  And once you 've got those things , then you can start your processing .  Right ?  OK .  Do you have this , uh ?  Oh , there 's there 's one other issue ,  uh , and that is that Dave throws out speakers that have less than twelve seconds of training data .  And he said there were a few in the Macrophone set like that .  So , do we need to wait to find out who he 's gonna throw out ,  so that we create a new set of short models that don't include those speakers ?  So i in Th - the problem is that if we proceed like we just described , um , when he goes to m um , create the new s training data with his processing , he throws out some speakers .  So the t two training sets won't be identical .  Yeah . Have just a little bit .  OK .  Yeah .  So you think it 's OK , then ?  It 's read .  We sh M  Right .  A actually you should be able to figure out , Dave ,  right ,  once you know the segmentations , uh , who you 're going to which speakers will get left out , even before you run your processing .  Right ?  Yeah . The segmentations from Don ?  Once we ?  Ah . Right , right , right , right , right .  Right . But I 'm just wondering how long it will take to get that information .  OK .  Sorry , Robert did what ?  Robert took what ?  Uh - huh .  Oh .  Is he gone now ?  Oh . Oh , oh . Oh , OK .  Are you are you interfacing to that thing with the C - plus - plus  Or are you is there another interface that you use ?  Yeah .  Oh .  And it saves it in a  I see .  Oh , that 's neat .  Ah . OK .  ",,
Bmr029.B,"It 's e F .  u I I I think , um , for the far - mike HTK system I was using , it did help somewhat .  I could re - check that .  But it was such a bad baseline that I don't know what that means .  Cuz the baseline word error rate was around forty percent on digits .  Right .  What wo  Uh , I I think also for the log spectral mean subtraction , uh , we wanna know which speaker 's talking when ,  cuz we wanna chain together the audio from one particular speaker to calculate the mean  and subtract it ,  and we don't  Well , we also have to mean subtract the test data .  OK .  And there 's , um ,  S so the way this means subtraction expects to work , is it expects to have , um , this continuous stream of audio data from a particular speaker to operate on .  And it goes along it with this sliding window , calculating the mean using the data in the window ,  and then subtracting that .  I mean , uh  That 's that 's how I 've been doing it ,  just by concatenating files together .  Um , and if these files and the  since they 're individual utterance files , um , s long silence periods are removed ,  which is a good thing .  Because this method might estimate the mean badly , if it had to face long silence periods .  But that does mean that I need as much I need twice as much disk space as the original set  cuz I need while I 'm running it cuz I need to create this intermediate set , um , of these big files ,  and then create the finally , the mean subtracted , um , little files .  And then I can get rid of the big files .  But st while I 'm doing the processing , I 'll nee I need twice as much disk space .  Right ,  an and  So so , Andreas , um ,  in U doctor speech data SRI Hub - five , there 's this , uh , Hub - five training set .  Now , is that the long training set there ?  OK .  OK . I th I think you already did , actually .  OK . And so , say the Macrophone files that are included in this short training , are just a subset of the Macrophone files .  Right ?  OK .  So so , um when you You did some TI - digits t t experiments training on Macrophone .  Um .  But that 's not necessarily any less data than the SRI Hub - five  set . It 's not a it 's not a subset of the short SRI Hu - Hub - five set .  Right ?  Uh , whe when you trained on Macrophone , um , to do those digits experiments , did you use the entire Macrophone corpus ?  Oh . OK .  OK - OK .  So Um  I I I got confused ,  cuz I thought I thought you were using the whole Macrophone set .  Um . OK .  Well , if if if I just need to use that subset , I I can get it processed .  I actually got I think I got f into it before ,  and then I thought I was doing the wrong thing  and I stopped .  And it shouldn it shouldn't take that long to do .  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  The segmentations ?  Oh .  Um  I I have i I have it for for Macrophone , um , already , I think ,  and , um , I think by tomorrow I 'll have it for th for the rest .  ",,
Bmr029.C,"OK . So the one one thing I knew I wanted to talk about was about , uh , sort of last minute stuff to to , uh , try to get some recognition results .  Yeah .  So , uh , on on on meeting data .  And so , I 'm I 'm not sure exactly what you 're doing already ,  and and there 's some stuff I 've talked to Dave  OK . So Um  Right . So so , we have some stuff with no overlap , uh , for which there would be near near - field results .  We wanted to get the far - field results for that .  And then this this real , uh , long shot thing would be , that we 'd apply Dave 's processing to , uh , potentially training and test data  and do the look at the same thing .  And in talking this morning with , uh , Chuck and with Dave one thought was to use  We couldn't remember how different the numbers were ,  but if you just worked with males only and used the short training there 're there 're  uh , I think Chuck 's recollection was that when he was doing the feature stuff , it took maybe a day and a half  to do the training .  Yeah .  Um , how much worse is the short training set than the large one , in terms of the ultimate performance ?  Yep .  So , it 's that should be fine for this , I would think .  So we an and you have the short you have short training results for the close case ?  So , how do you know it 's ?  Oh , it 's three percent on on , uh , on Hub - five .  I see .  Yeah . But we have the models so we could get that number ,  and  So the question is , what ? w  It has to be enough so that  I mean , it 's the non - overlap only .  Um And  it has to be enough to be sort of comparable to what you folks were seeing and what you reported already .  I mean  No . He has to create that .  But but s but so  Um  We have a whole parallel set of things over here which are all with digits .  And and and Dave has been working with that and there 's all of those issues .  But I know that if I go in with something that 's not just digits it would be good .  And , um , so  We already have these results that you  I mean , on uh , a l a lot tha tha a particular test set , that you that we reported at HLT .  Um , it 'd be nice to have something more than that .  And w we had talked about was having distant  Um , and then ,  uh , if we could on top of that  I mean , so this is gonna be a lot worse .  Right ?  Whatever comparison we w w one would presume .  But we don't know how much worse ,  w w uh , which is certainly one interesting thing .  And then , um ,  Dave  I think we figured that it 'd probably take a day or two to compute the the ,  uh uh  Well How many hours of training ?  Yeah .  Yeah , but we also have to do this other processing , so having a smaller training set ,  if it 's only a few percent difference , it might be be worth doing it .  But - m How big is the small training set ?  Do you remember ?  It 's around there .  And ha and and male is roughly half of that ,  or ?  Or or or was that only male ?  OK .  Yeah .  So  Yeah . So that 's certainly part of the issue , is that right now he 's he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency .  Yeah . It 's it 's in Matlab  and so on ,  and And , uh , it 's not an impossible amount of time .  We we were guestimating it was like one and a half times faster than real time , or something ?  So , if there 's thirty hours of data , you can calculate that he can do , uh , the enhancement in a day  and something .  So  But if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something , I think it 'd be prohibitive .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . So , I mean , it 's a bit of a push ,  but it seems like ,  OK , we 've got some models ,  we 've got some training data , we have software that works , he 's got a method that helps with , you know , other ta another task .  Um  It , you know , appears to be , you know , debugged .  Um  Yes .  Oh . Well , that 's not bad .  You mean the training .  Yeah .  For the test .  Yeah , fo  Right .  Yeah .  I mean , it it 'd be really great if it was all automatic , but I think that , you know , given the pressure of time , if i i  I mean , since you 're gonna find out in a short amount of time , that 's great .  But i if if it doesn't work out , I think we would rather charge ahead with the older segmentations  and Um ,  and we were gonna use one of the P Z  I don I don't know what  Probably whatever one you 've been using for for for the digits .  Is it this one ?  I I 'd which ?  ",,
Bmr029.C,"That 's F ?  How do you know ?  Oh .  Bien sur  OK . Alright , so  Bet they 'll have fun with that one .  OK , so .  Uh  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Well Maybe .  But , I I mean , how long does it take for the test ?  Right .  Bu - But what what was your result for uh , that we had at the HLT ?  Was that a combination of me ?  So you were doing like  Yeah . But if you So , if you do half a dozen meetings , that 's that 's about a day .  We also have more machines now .  well  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean , if we had about six A six hour test set 's not bad .  Right ?  You know ?  Right ?  I mean , a lot of the evaluations have been  Four that you worked with ?  That would be OK , too .  I mean , I 'm i  So , if they have a set that they worked with ,  and you you got  Did you do similarly in performance between them and the other meetings ,  or was it ?  Yeah .  And overlap or not .  Yeah .  So maybe just with the the the Meeting Recorder set of the De - th that you did before .  Yeah . So we want to do the same same thing .  Yeah . Once we know which segmentations we 're using .  Yeah .  Um , I I agree that that would be an interesting thing to do ,  but I sort of regard it as secondary .  So if there 's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they 're waiting for other things to finish , then sure .  But  Uh , Chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know , um  Cuz , I mean , you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave 's processing made the , uh , far microphone like the near microphone .  In which case you shouldn't have to actually retrain .  But it 's it 's not really true .  It 's it 's sort of fantasy .  It does it does muck up the data in in some funny ways .  And so ,  I 'm I 'm kind of questioning that .  But But  Right .  It involves retraining and it involves a  Uh , that 's right .  I mean the other thing which which it might come in to is if there was some problem in the retraining .  I mean , maybe you 'd just have some mechanical thing we do wrong .  Uh , that , uh since Dave 's experience was that it didn't help as much if you didn't retrain , but it does help some , that we would hopefully see that .  So , that that 's that 's true .  I i  Right . So  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean , do you ha do you have to rely on his segmentations at all to do the top one ?  Oh . OK .  Got it .  We we talked about this before .  I think what we were saying was that , um , the very fact that in both cases we 're ignoring the overlap section means that , um , uh , we 're to some extent finessing that .  So , um ,  I think , for the purposes of just determining whether a far - field microphone uh , what the effect of the far - field microphone is , we should do the same to both .  I mean  We want to i incorporate certain data that would not be available during final tests , uh , under a a full fair test of it , much as we are in the all the numbers that we have so far .  Yeah .  We we simply wanna determine what 's the difference in performance due to being distant versus close .  I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way , too ,  because you have leakage into other microphones .  Right ?  But , it 's just you 're using the fact that this is where this person is .  Right ?  So .  It 's just easier to do .  Yeah .  So , how do you determine what you use to group together to be a a ?  The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah . An - and e so that will tell us what the difference it between the mikes ,  and then , uh , in order to  The the other difference that we 'd have to take care of is that ,  uh yeah , we we don't have a mike that , uh , is particular to a person .  And so we 'll have to do some clustering ,  and that 'll be another another , uh , issue , too .  But , it it I could be wrong ,  but it seems to me that that the speaker  the the level of degradation that you get from having the distant mike in a normal acoustic is much greater than what you get from , say , not applying speaker adaptation or applying speaker adaptation .  I think that the  I mean , we 'll see .  But but , I think that the kind of gains that we 've seen from speaker adaptation on Hub - five sort of things are like a few percent .  Right ?  And  Yeah .  It doesn't make that much difference , I think .  I would doubt that it would be a huge amount of difference for that .  So , I mean , I I think that that difference would definitely be marginal .  ",,
Bmr029.C,"I think the main thing is to do something  to do some cepstral mean subtraction on some level .  And , uh , so what 's different about this processing is just that we 're doing it at a much longer time scale .  Right ?  But Um  That 's right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Um . Yeah , I guess .  But , um ,  I also think that a again once we got into it , that , um , using some kind of clustering would probably work reasonably well there , too .  Certainly for the the two microphone case ,  which we 're not gonna mess with because it 's another whole deal with the low - quality microphones ,  um ,  we ought to be able to at least tell that it appears that things are coming from a particular direction .  So we ought to be able to use that information , um , as well .  But , I think we might be able to do not too bad a job of separating out sp uh , segments that appear to come from a single speaker  both in terms of s acoustic similarity and in terms of direction .  So , I mean But that 's another research thing to do  and probably won't get done the next week .  Well , I mean , I 'm I 'm leaving for for the , uh , the New Orleans meeting , uh , next Saturday ,  and and , um ,  it 'd be kinda nice to have some results at least a day or two before that , so that I could figure out what I wanted to say about it .  Yeah .  Uh , not to mention that that , uh , Mari 's putting together this report next week , too , you know .  So Uh ,  what we were hoping was that over the weekend we could do , uh , the , um , calculation on the training set  and , uh  uh , maybe , you know , we could by the end of the weekend , we could have the top one ,  and and then early next week , do these .  If we had enough machines , maybe do them in parallel .  So that by the middle of the week we had s had some kind of result .  I mean , it 's it 's one of these Hail Mary kinds of things .

I think , che check with Dave .  Yeah .  I thought they were like mushrooms .  They 're popping up .  Yeah .  Cuz we still all have tha the that other one going ,  which is the , uh the Macrophone training .  That was in the Hub - five small training set ?  Yes .  OK .  I wonder about that , though .  I mean , because all we 're doing The only reason we 're using the short training set is is for speed .  And there we 're not really making any claims about using a smaller training set .

The training set he could go through right now , and see how how long the  At that one ? Maybe .  Uh  Been looking at synthesizers ?  You were looking at Festival .  Yeah .  Right .  This was a business about , uh , um , coming up with something that that was purely prosodic .  And so , uh , we 're just gonna use a pitch detector ,  drive a synthesizer ,  and since it doesn't have a hook in it for , uh , modifying energy , we 'll have a little box at the output that 'll modify the energy .

And there 's a bit of a question whether you want to use um , what segmentations you want to use .  Uh  Uh , David just  Um , I 'm sorry .  Don just , uh , created a new version of the first meetings that we had previously recognized ,  but with different segmentation .  And so Um  It would be nice  I mean , if the results are comparable to what we had before  to use those segmentations ,  because th then we could claim that everything 's automatic .  Right .  Well , I 'm as I said , I just started the recognizer , um  It will uh , it will probably be a couple hours before before I have some results .  So  But the segmentations matter for the filtering .  Right ?  Because  For the test set . Yeah .  So ,  need to be  But , first first , of course , you would wanna process the training data ,  because we wanna get that started .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Ma - maybe you should limit ourselves to the Meeting Recorder meetings ?  Um ,  if you were gonna cut down on the test set , I would suggest that .  Actually , the longer the Robustness meetings take longer ,  because there 's this one speaker who talks a lot .  And so  the Um .  No . It 's because for all the for the adaptation and normalization steps , you cannot  you have to d you have to , uh , um ,  you cannot chop it up into small pieces .  So , you 're sort of limited by how long the longest speaker , uh , is s speaking .  So how much data there is from the the speaker who talks the most .  So , um , you parallelize across different speakers ,  but you know , if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh who who speaks a lot , then effectively , everybody waits for the longest one to process .  So .  That was both types of meetings ,  but most but there were only two Robustness meetings , and four or five , uh , Meeting Recorders .  Right .  Oh .  Uh , I I  I don't have I don't have a good gue  For everything ?  For all the meetings ?  Uh .  Um .  It 's probably more than a day ,  but probably less than two .  Well , i No . I mean for all the meetings .  Because it 's Again , it 's ,  um  So each meeting each meetings takes , uh , something like  Again , we we I ran when we ran these , we were sort of short on machines ,  and , um ,  I don't know ,  I I would estimate maybe four hours per meeting .  Something like that .  Right .  Right . Right . So that 's why I 'm saying I 'm not sure how they would scale with more machines .  Right .  We have MR  two , th We have two , three , four , fi  I think there are four Meeting Recorder meetings that we worked with .  Yeah .  Five ?  OK .  ",,
Bmr029.F,"Uh , with the Robust - compared to Robustness ?  Yeah .  The big variation is by whether it 's a native speaker or not .  And whether it 's , um  Uh , I think that 's the o actually  and and of course what , um , you know , whether it 's lapel or , uh , headset microphone .  Yeah .  And we can exclude we don't need to recognize the non - natives ,  because we know that  I mean , in fact , we excluded them previously from  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Wait , did ?  So when you used original the original models , and you just process the test set in this way , d do you get any do you get decent performance or not ?  Mm - hmm .  Mmm . Right .  Right .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK . Well , I 'll I can get started on the  well , the first the one that already has a  cross there .  We need to re - do that with small models .  Right .  And then , have to ask , um , I guess , Don to , uh , cut the , um , cut the segments for the sh for the tis distant mike .  Uh , uh that 's So we would be using the same channel for each fo for everything ?  OK .  So .  No , no . We would use the same segmentations ,  but he needs to extract extract the wavef form segments from a different channel .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Um Yeah .  If assuming that the performance turns out to be comparable with with the old experiments and the old segmentations .  Now there 's the issue of  Oh , OK . So there 's the issue of speaker normalization .  So , with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker is talking .  Right ?  Mm - hmm .  I see . So you want to cheat ?  OK . So we assume we assume knowledge of the speakers as as , um in a way that 's compatible with the close - talking test set .  OK .  Oh , OK .  No . It means No . It just means  you you group together the segments that by magic you know belong to one speaker ,  and and treat  Right .  Right .  But , um  Well , in the new test , actually , that 's not true .  So Again , if this if these new segmentations work OK , then we then it 's a fair it 's a completely fair test .  You group together all the data coming in through one channel  and where Thilo 's speech detector has has determined that there is speech .  And that speech is is deemed to come from that speaker , whether that 's true or not .  So if you get some cross - talk from another microphone , then you just process this it as if it were from that speaker .  Well , that 's more of a problem .  I mean , because it 's You can just pretend it 's some kind of gene  I mean you can pretend it 's all from one speaker  and do all this processing the same ,  but then you 're gonna get results that are worse on account of not doing proper speaker normalization  and you 're gonna have  So , you could certainly do better than that by doing , for instance uh , cluster the segments ,  which is what we do , say , in a Broadcast News system , where you don't have speaker labels .  But that would be another processing step that I 'm I would have to debug first , and so forth ,  and so we wanna avoid that .  So I agree with you . We should we should , uh , do the you know , this sort of cheating experiment .  Mm - hmm .  It 's not just speaker adaptation .  It 's the whole norm feature normalization process .  I it 's spea uh , all that is speaker - based .  You know , so we  So , in that I 'm ,  um  Y you know , d d b the most important , of course , is the cepstral mean subtraction .  And that  I don't know if we  we never really  I don't remember ,  because it 's so far s so long ago that we didn't do that on a per speaker basis ,  but  A and by the way ,  it 's actually we 're we 're already If we use the same segmentations that we use for the close - talking microphone , then the segmentations assume that we have access to all channels  and cross correlate them ,  so there 's no point in not using that knowledge for speaker identification .  Yeah .  Right .  OK .  Right . So what what is the schedule here ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , we 'll call you when you get there .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  I 'll ask  The other thing is , um  and I 'll ask Don which is easier to process in terms of creating these  the the test data for the far far microphone .  If if it turns out that for some reason it 's easier for him to use the old um , the the the old ,  uh ,  segmentations , then we 'll just use that , I figure .  Um  Mm - hmm .  Um  Right .  Yeah .  Um Right . Uh , let 's see . The the  You you can I mean you could you could run the ,  um ,  ",,
Bmr029.F,"you c Basically , once the , um , whe the top the top one 's done , you could easily re - run the whole set of experiments .  Uh , I mean , manage the jobs and so forth ,  uh Um ,  that 's all  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Right . So , somehow the  Assuming he uses the new naming scheme , then he should call the waveforms  the so , the waveform names have the , you know , meeting meeting ID ,  and the microphone ,  and the , um  I guess , the channel and the microphone and the speaker , um , speaker  some something that identifies the speaker .  So  Exactly . So , uh well , you still need to be able to distinguish the different speakers .  That 's the key point .  Because , if we wanna do what we just discussed  So Uh , uh , the the best the easiest way to do that would be to just take You know , you make the channel be channel F ,  but then keep the speaker names the same as they would be in the old in the close - talking , uh , version .  Right . Exactly .  I , uh , I I can talk to him .  Well , they grow them on trees now .  Just , you shake them and they fall down .  OK .  Mm - hmm ?  Mmm . Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  That 's everything . Yeah ,  so  So , I can give you a list of the short version .  So you can  Oh , OK .  That 's right .  Yeah .  Um  Wel - No , it is .  Th - the  Sorry .  Um . Can you repeat the question ?  There wa it is a subse  Yeah .  No . Only the portion that was in the Hub - five training set .  Well , the Hub - five small training set contains as much Macrophone as the large training set , for historical reasons .  Yeah .  So , do you have that processed there , then  right ?  Because you already did did y didn't you already do that experiment ?  Mm - hmm .  No .  Mmm . OK .  Right .  And you need only the males .  So .  Does this th this ?  It - it 's sort of f f not very nice to use the small training set for another reason ,  which is that the you also are losing on Again , because you don't use all the data you have for one speaker .  So , the normalizations you compute for your training speakers will be , uh , crummier than they would in the large training set .  So , um , I have to So , to make it really a matching experiment , I have to find  uh , I have to use short models that were trained on normalizations that were also only estimated on the short set .  Which is , uh  I think so .  I 've I I have to check .  In any case , I could retrain short models within a few hours actually at if I use machines at SRI .  Yeah .  No . But the thing is , if if we used if we used the whole training set for normalizations , then David would have to process much more data ,  which That 's a that 's one bottleneck , for us  right ,  in terms of get  Yeah .  Right .  So , you wanna do the exact same thing ,  or else you 'll have apples and oranges .  So .  It doesn't make I don't think it makes that much of a difference .  It 's just this little detail that if you can take care of that , then you should .  I I think I have I have the models ,  I have I have ,  um  let 's see , um  Yeah . And if not I can retrain those models very quickly .  Uh  Yeah .  Yeah . I don't think it 'll make a matter .  In fact , I thought about throwing those out too ,  because when I heard how little speech there was for some of them , I thought they can only hurt your models ,  because they 're again their normalizations will be all all all over the map ,  and you won't get very very clean models from them , anyhow .  So .  Yeah .  In fact , if if you wanna do this , uh , to speed things up , um , you we can leave out the Macrophone data altogether .  That hurt  Actually .  Oh , no . Sorry .  Not in the short .  Then you have too little data .  OK .  Sorry . Forget that .  Um ,  When you use when you go to the large training set , then leaving out Macrophone actually sometimes helps you ,  because it 's it it 's just not relevant to the to the meeting and or to conversational speech anyway .  OK .  Yeah . Leave it out ,  and Um , in the event that I retrain the short models ,  um , why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out ,  and I I 'll throw them out , too .  And then we have complete completely identical training conditions .  But th the segmentations are only they only affect the test set .  We 're talking about the training speakers .  Right .  He already has the in you already have the information .  Right ?  Mm - hmm .  OK . Alright .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  ",,

Yeah , have you guys seen the display ?  Have you guys seen either of the demos ?  They 're pretty cool ,  like the prosody demo , we basically w loaded up um , word alignments .  So , instead of having um , utterances in the bottom , it 's like just word by word .  So you can see exactly where the overlaps are .  And then , um , Adam did something where , um , we converted these feature files into wave files ,  so you can display them .  Yeah . Instead of the wave file .  And then w using multi - wave you can add a file and play that sound .  Play the audio corresponding to that , um , um , feature file ,  and it 's all like , aligned and stuff .  Yeah , so you see the pitch contours  and you and when you hit play , like there 's a line that goes through it ,  you know , and it 's all aligned with like the t the audio and the feature file .  Yeah .  Yeah , there 's a  Yeah .  There 's a median filtering and then there 's a piece - wise linear fit , based on some criteria .  I 'm not sure .  Yeah , sure .  I should email Morgan about it too ,  because he was asking about that .  And Yeah .  Right , well , then it 's not a linear f fit .  You 're not fitting anything then .  Well  Yeah . It  It 's kind of a useless one .  Yeah , I actually don't know off the top of my head .  This was um , Kemal Sonmez at SRI ,  who 's a co - worker with , uh , Liz .  Yeah . Did I just  Oh . Oh .  Sorry .  Um , yeah , but , so Kamal has , uh  He did a paper on this for some v speech verification , uh , project ,  and we basically e extrapolated what he what he did for that work and applied it to our files .  And that 's how we do That 's how we get our feature files and everything for all the prosody .  That  No , we grabbed most of it .  Like , we grabbed the linear fitting stuff .  We did all the alignments  and all the matching and stuff ,  but the actual coding of the  the math was done somewhere else .  Uh , so that 's what you were working on ,  right ?  From end to en Like , from the beginning of the process to the end of the process ?  Ooo . Yeah .  Yeah , right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  S  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .

Oh .  Display the features .  Mm - hmm .  So you see , like , the F - zero contour ?  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Oh , neat .  Was this code that you downloaded to do this ?  Or was it  Hmm .  At SRI dot com ?  No , i  It sounded like a URL , the way you were saying it ,  yeah .  So what I mean is , like the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here ?  Or you grabbed code from somewhere else ?  Ah .  I see .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , it 's done now .  She said it was much faster .  It really helped a lot to have that .  So , um , you know , there were a l  From scratch .  Yeah . So  No , f no . So from the point where we s take it , it 's faster .  u So it 's sorta like doing things in parallel .  You know ? So if , you know , if they can be working on that while we 're working on the other things , then when we get them in , they don't have to do that one from scratch , basically .  Yeah , th Right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from IBM ,  part  There 's there 's several problems .  One is , um , we were giving them these large files ,  which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes .  So either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes ,  so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them .  So one of the things that we did is , Adam made a modification to th his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want , uh , basically , uh , chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty - five minutes .  And then we can give those to IBM  and it 'll make it easier for them to put them on tape .  Um , then the other thing is that these pool of transcribers that they 're using , um , sort of are not dedicated to to our project ,  but are in use for all IBM projects ,  and IBM has recently giving given them uh , a whole bunch of stuff .  So it 's gonna , sort of delay us .  Hmm , that 's an interesting idea .  Yeah . So the only difference would be , we would be putting the stuff on tape versus IBM .  And then we could send If if we had that process down , of putting the audio onto tape ,  we can send IBM the tapes or we can send this transcription place the tape  Yeah .  Well , u u  So , I don't know where the bottleneck was .  Was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunks ? or was it actually putting it onto the tape ?  Exactly .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , so how do we do that ?  How would we put  Yeah .  So plug i So , like , the headphone output in the back of the computer ?  Line - out into the line - in on a tape player ,  and  Oh ! Well , that sounds pretty easy .  Mmm .  Yeah . But if it was at your desk or something  Well , they There was  OK .  So th They , um , they gave They 've given us  Since we started doing this new , uh , beep format with "" beep number beep "" ,  they 've given us , uh , I think , two full , uh , transcripts .  They have a third one  and Brian just sent me a note saying "" oh , that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their tr of the eh transcriptionists ' , uh , s company "" .  ",,
Bmr030.B,"And so there 's gonna be delay of a week before we get that third one back .  And I 've already given him three more to work on ,  but he said those new three won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company .  Yeah . Yeah , they 're working away .  They 're just doing  Right , right .  So what we do is , uh , when I go to um , select meetings for IBM , I go into the um  well , into the the , uh , master sheet here with the statuses  and I pick ones that Thilo has , um , pre - segmented ,  and I change the status to "" Trans - IP IBM "" ,  so that , you know , when Jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those .  And , um  So I 'm not picking huge chunks , right now , of meetings for them ,  but  Mm - hmm . That 's a good idea .  Yeah .  Huh .  So when that thing When it stutters like that , is it because there 's a delay getting the data off a disk ? Or is it because there 's a delay in the D to A ?  OK .  Yeah .  I see .  Maybe we could do it from a w a PC or something .  Yeah .  Well , you know , I I think David might have a bunch of o old P Cs ,  cuz he 's replacing them with these new ones .  Maybe we could get one ,  and just dedicate it to doing this .  Not even hook it u  Well , I guess we need to hook it to the network  so we can get the files to it ,  but  Uh ,  Yeah . Right .  And then just use that machine to hook up to the tape .  Yeah .  We don't need a powerful machine to do these things ,  right ?  So , one of these old Pentiums that we have  Hmm .  Should talk to him about that .  Yeah , yeah .  That 's why I wanted to avoid having to do that if we could ,  but  It 's just another  They have a um a device that , you put the cassette in  and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that .  So .  I guess they haven't got a p  Really !  Y can you send them huge audio files ?  Yeah .  Huh !  That 's interesting .  Well , that 's true .  Are How big are these files that we send to Brian ?  Really ?  That big ?  I thought it was , like , a hundred megs .  Yeah .  Hmm .  That 's still pretty dang big .  Yeah .  I don't know .  Wha - whatever you generate .  Yeah , the last ones you did were compressed .  Yeah .  Wonder if the ones before that were shortened .  Cuz it 's all  Mmm .  Hmm !  Yeah .  What will that do ?  Is that going to ?  Oh , so we can get rid of the uh  Oh ! That 'll be nice .  I should be around .  Experiments ?  Yeah , I guess that 's probably next .  Yeah .  Something about  Demo .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh , I made a  Oh , but that 's not specific to Meeting Recorder .  I was gonna say I took some a suggestion of Adam 's ,  and I , um , created a m CGI script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks .  So if you go to the speech local web page , and then there 's a disk status page .  You can click on that  and it 'll query Abbott ,  and give you a a list of all the disks that we have  and then , uh , what 's on each one ,  and then it shows how big the disk is  and what percent full it is .  So .  And that 's , you know , each time you go there , it 's updated .  So .  The new disks are installed .  If you need space just let me know .  I have to create the p appropriate sub - directory .  So we 're s kinda trying to keep even the scratch ones we 're keeping a little organized , where we put a y a U doctor speech data ,  and then I 'll either create a sub - directory for , like if it 's Meeting Recorder project , or Hub - five or whatever .  So we c  I just have to create those sub - directories ,  and  No .  No .  Nnn .  It 's all scratch .  Yeah .  Uh , DE , which is where we 're putting all the meeting stuff  No , it 's D E .  D E 's not full .  DD 's full .  That was the first one .  Or , that was the last one that w filled up ,  and DE still had like ,  last time I looked it was like seven gigs or something .  So .  And each meeting is roughly half a gig ,  and so .  We 're getting close .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  Morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year .  Like when we get around a hundred meetings .  Um , because there 's gonna be data coming from UW , hopefully by then .  Yeah , it feels funny ,  huh ?  If we have the capability .  Now that we 're used to recording , it 's like , eh , well , why not keep going ?  Mm - hmm .  ",,
Bmr030.B,"We have right now , like , seventy - five or seventy - six hours of meetings .  But aren't we still using the , uh , compressed  Oh .  Yeah .  Yeah , we need to figure something out ,  cuz the Abbott is basically  e e We can't add anymore disks to it .  We can increase the size of the disks that are on it ,  but that will only take us so far .  So , um ,  David had the suggestion about , you know , new servers and things like that ,  and so I 'm gonna see if we can talk to Morgan about getting some money for a new disk server .  And , uh  Yeah , it would have to replace Abbott , basically .  Yeah .  Well , he David 's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers .  I think he wants to sorta go with the same type of machine for all of these .  But , um  Yeah , it 's full in there .

So , I mean , it 's good news .  It 's not as good as it could have been  but it was , uh  The the I T Rs are , you know , a a long shot , and so it 's it 's really nice that we got that .  Information Technology Research ?  Something like that ?  It 's , uh  Yeah , it was specifically on the meeting .  So , d was that the one that was the meeting maps ?  OK , good .  I liked that one .  Well , the the sort of general idea was , you can think about meetings at lots of different levels ,  all the way d from all the way down to acoustics to all the way up to dialogue , discourse , topic .  And so this this was , how do you map all that information onto that ?  a onto the meeting domain .  So that the the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions .  And so , uh ,  So this had a lot of different stuff in it .  It 's mostly higher level .  Yeah .  But , nonetheless , I think if we  It 's a it 's a cool idea .  And if we can actually get it get it going that would be neat .  So And uh , this was the one also that was ,  uh ,  Was it with Susan Ervin - Tripp ?  She 's a linguist on campus .  Anyway .  So , other topics I wanted to talk about are , um , the DARPA demo which , I guess , since Morgan isn't here we can't really talk about .  I just wanted to make sure it was ready to go .  Uh , but I guess  Your stuff is all ready  so it 's just a question of , did Morgan get around to testing it .  Yeah , I got it . With the instructions .  Yep .  Yeah , so I guess we ge we had better be on call for a little while .  I don't know .  I haven't spoken with him .  Alt Tab .  I I think  I think the problem was that , I was t saying "" hit Alt Tab "" with the assumption that he knew what I meant .  But he didn't .  So .  But it doesn't .  It doesn't .  And and all I said was oh just cycle through with Alt Tab  because that 's the standard way of doing it in Windows .  But of course he doesn't use Windows .  So ,  he didn't know what I meant .  Hold down at hold down Alt ,  and then tap Tab several times  and you 'll cycle through all the open applications .  Right .  That 's a good idea .  That 's not a bad idea at all ,  so that , uh  Yeah , and since the files are short , it 's just  I mean the Tcl - TK overhead is pretty high ,  but it shouldn't matter .  I think he had one twenty - eight ,  eh ,  but  It was faster than my PC .  So .  I assume . But they 're all doing Communicator stuff .  So .  I mean , the talk 's only twenty minutes .  So . You know , all this time we spent on it 's gonna be thirty seconds of screen time .  Yeah , I  Actually , both of them .  You know , cuz we 're gonna wanna be playing with the  uh  help , my brain  with the uh ,  prosody stuff anyway .  Um , so , actually , at some point w we should talk to users of that technology who are actually gonna be using it  and see what they would like to see .  Audio .  And the stylized F - naught features are pretty cool .  So , these this it 's - does a piece - wise linear  and so , normally if you look at an F - naught track , it jumps all over the place .  This is a nice smooth one  and it really does a good job .  It 's a combination .  Uh , t  G Actually could you email me a reference to that paper ? If you have it ?  Cuz I 'm sorta curious how what criteria it has .  I mean , so , there 's obviously a trade - off between the number of knots y you pick , and the best fit .  I mean , so , if you 're doing a piece - wise linear , you have to figure out how many pieces you want .  And so there 's a trade - off  because the best the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots .  Well , sure it is .  But  So so you There 's a trade - off  and I 'm wondering what criteria they use .  Mm - hmm .  Dot com .  No , I you said "" at SRI ""  ",,
Bmr030.E,"so I had to add the "" dot com "" .  Hmm .  So , other topic is , uh , the IBM transcription status stuff .  So we 've sent a few to them .  We 've gotten a few back .  Um ,  I sorta wish Jane was were here  because I think she gave  Didn't she give one of them to one of the transcribers ?  And , how was it ?  Great .  Hand .  Well , but that 's what we wanted .  Right .  We knew it would be longer to have multiple groups .  Right .  Well , pipelined .  The idea is that we 're taking less time of the linguists .  Of the transcribers .  So .  We might wanna revisit hiring our own external transcription company .  Because I think that would be cheaper than having our people do it ,  but do it with the same process with these beep files .  I mean , cuz , originally I had disc discounted that  because it was just gonna be too hard .  But now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out .  Then maybe it would be OK .  Yep .  And we might wanna do that anyway .  Because it seems like that 's being a bottleneck and that 's silly .  It shouldn't be a bottleneck .  I mean It would Once we got it set up it w it  It may well have been partially that , you know ,  because they tried it ,  and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps ,  and go forward in the file , et cetera , et cetera .  But , uh ,  it just seems like it 's not hard for us to do ,  and that would just make things go faster .  Get a tape deck ,  plug it in to the computer ,  hit record ,  on the tape deck ,  and just do it all all uh , analog .  Well , line out .  Mm - hmm .  So I mean , that 's the easy way .  They might have a more complex set - up at IBM .  I 've seen digital digital analog tapes where it 's controlled by the computer .  But w But we don't need to do that .  The the disadvantage of doing it this way is it 's real time .  So you would have to sit there for an hour while it 's recording .  But  Right . It 's not a big deal .  Master .  So  We should at least ask , um , Brian if there are any particular requirements for putting things on tape .  Is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that ?  And , uh  And then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us .  I mean the o the other problem is you would wanna r do it on an unloaded machine .  Right ?  Because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering .  And that means That that 's more of a problem  because y then you have to be there .  Right .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  It could be either .  I mean , there are lots of different places .  It can be delay on the disk ,  or it can be just load gets high on the machine .  Um , either IO load or processor load .  You know , it 's a problem with these multi - user systems is that lots of processes are running  and you don't t really have control .  Wha  That 's true .  It 'll  That 's right . So you really do wanna be using a machine that 's not  No , because we 're doing the beep files .  Yep .  Or you could just You could have it no active connection .  Just SCP them .  Actually , it wouldn't be bad to have that , plus put on that machine a CD burner .  No .  A DVD burner , yeah .  I guess the real question is , where would we put it and who would do it ?  I guess whoever records the meeting .  I mean , it it 's not a big deal ,  but it 's yet another thing you have to do .  No , because the transcription company does what they do .  Actually there are a few I saw a web - based one at one point .  Where you could send them audio files over the web  and they send you back text files over the web .  I should look that up again .  Mmm . Mmm .  I assume that you can send them anything that they can access with HTTP .  Half a gig .  Oh , no , wait .  They 're the beep files .  Yeah , it 's a p hundred meg .  They 're the beep files .  That 's right .  So they 're smaller .  Yes .  And we are sending them the compressed ones ,  right ?  Yeah .  Were "" shortened "" .  Yeah .  Yeah .  The beep files , actually the "" shorten "" doesn't save a whole lot .  Right ?  Because the whole point is that it 's extracting pie pars parts that are loud anyway .  So .  I think it only saves , like , half .  OK . So I think we just gotta let things slide for now ,  and see see what 's gonna happen .  Nothing else really to do .  Um ,  We have new equipment that I 'm gonna try to set up tomorrow .  New wireless .  And so , uh  Give us a couple more wireless channels .  Yep .  Yep .  But it involves rewiring .  ",,
Bmr030.E,"And so , if I could borrow someone tomorrow afternoon to help my brain .  You know , just have someone to bounce the instructions off of  and make sure I don't do anything too stupid .  Did I have another topic on the on the list ?  That 's  Wha - what did I have on the agenda I mailed out ?  Yeah , that 's it .  That was it .  Short meeting ?  Does anyone have anything else ?  Do we have new DD disks also ?  Darn .  So , it 's all just scratch .  OK .  How are we doing on  No , DE is full .  We must be doing it on D F .  OK , I guess I 'm just one off .  OK .  Half .  So that means we 're p getting pretty close .  Shoot !  I just hate not to get data .  Yeah .  I The other thing we could do is stop doing the regular ones .  And try to convince other topics to come in and do some .  Cuz I think that would be nice .  Yeah , the other thing we were talking about also is once we exp once the disk has been backed up , we don't actually need it on - line .  So another option is to copy it to tape manually  so we have the back - up copy and the tape copy ,  the archive copy and the back - up copy .  And then just take them off - line .  Once we have the expanded versions .  So if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do is leave those up ,  and then use And then not necessarily have the original data on - line .  Full .  Well , that would be pretty tight i in the machine room .  Eesh !  Mm - hmm .  What are they called ?  What are they named ?  I assume they 're in the P - make pool .  P - make stuff .  P - make magic .  Or customs magic .  If you do "" man customs "" , it has almost all of that .  Do we have an attribute for non - interactive machines ?  Cuz I was thinking that would be a good one to have .  Ones that aren't on people 's desks .  Y right .  Yep .  Anyway .  Shall we do digits ?  And off .  ",,
Bmr031.A,"Hello ?  OK .  Should we close the door ?  Well , I tend to  th there 're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this ,  in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says "" OK . ""  So , we 're starting right now .  This is the  Yeah .  u  Didn't get the door .  Is it turned on ?  OK .  Channel B .  Channel B .  Do they know about your pie chart ?  OK .  He has a nice pie chart on the , uh , s the current status page ,  which shows the amount of transc amount of data that had been transcribed  and the amount out of the entire  and at this point it 's not quite half .  Wouldn't Is that what you 'd say , with the pie chart ?  And then of that , there 's , uh , a little sliver  I could try and draw it  but it 's probably better to describe .  So Roughly . Almost .  Not quite .  And I haven't actually caught up with , uh  since I got back so recently from my vacation .  Um , I know that the transcribers finished , um , uh , several meetings while I was gone .  And I haven't told you  cuz I haven't I haven't figured out which ones they are y are yet .  But when that happens , then that pie will get even closer to the midline .  It 's not quite not quite fifty percent  but really getting close .  I think it will be .  Well , not mathematically .  n  But it 's a nice it 's I recommend his his his graphic ,  cuz it 's it 's a really nice graphic .  Can't we downsample  and , uh , transcribe on that basis ?  Also seems like the corpus could all be standardized on s on this the , uh  Yeah .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Do you want to write on the l on the board ?  I could write on the board .  Last updated in July .  Oh , I 'm not sure . The one that I saw on the web when I came back .  OK .  OK .  Yes . At present there 's n none of those are on the pie chart .  There 're five ?  Good .

Those will figure less prominently in things anyway .  Long vacations .  Oh , thank you . Thank you .  Yeah . I mean , you know , it 's an extra step .  Well , for speed .  To get rid of what ?  OK .  No .  No .  Oh .  ",,
Bmr031.B,"Right . It would have to be hand  Right .  It would have to be  Well , a h a person would would check it over  and then give a final  I 'm  Well , it 's more  you didn't  Oh , sorry .  You were saying that we were waiting for Chuck ,  so I just  OK .  OK .  Well , that 's good .  I overlap exactly with the times you 're gone .  I mean  Yeah .  Pie .  Mmm .  You mean  But but that was read speech .  Maybe like twenty hours . We could try ,  but Maybe not counting the non - native speech ,  cuz if That that just doesn't translate very well .  Right . And actually the I was thinking about this  the original application doesn't really appl  I mean , if you 're using this over and over again , you 're gonna be testing on the same the same speakers .  I just mean that it 's not a terrible thing to assume that you don't that you don't have disjoint sets ,  for this particular kind of application .  I mean  Yeah .  Somewhat . Although what 's interesting is that the majority of the words in the language model are actually  Yeah . They 're actually these , like , function words  and "" Yeah ! "" and s stuff like that .  And there there 's a lot of speaker dependence there .  Even the transcribers will say they know who the speaker is after a while just from their backchannels  and  Right .  So y So , I don't think you 're talking the way you write , in in other words .  What 's the plan if were we still going to be like a center for transcribing data ?  What happens if th they don't deliver things until next year or something when we have less resources  or ?  Mm - hmm .  Are they they 're doing , like , twenty - two  or s ?  Could  Forty - eight ?  Forty forty - four ?  Yeah .  CD - ROM .  Yeah .  Forty - four .  S  But but it but forty - four and sixteen are not easy ?  Yeah ?  It 's not lossy ?  As long as you 're  Yeah .  As long as you 're not doing the processing on the downsampled  I mean Just for transcribing it , you mean ?  For  Yeah .  They 're taking up more disk space .  Yeah .  They 'll have to start kicking people out of the meetings ,  like  As long as they have only , like , three people per meeting .  I mean , they can just limit the number of people .  Yeah . They were g they said they were gonna record @ @  I don't know if there were fifty ,  but there were definitely above , like , twenty .  It was it was high .  Sixteen .  You just get , like , one backchannel at a time or something .  And there 's never any talk ?  Was there ever any talk of taking the , um , close - talking mikes when people aren't talking and deleting those portions ?  Or is the breathing and things ?  Yeah ?  OK .  And if they 're still that big  I see . Yeah , that 's true .  OK . So it 's still really big even if you 're only one person or two people at most are actually talking all the time .  Wow .  Have shorter meetings !  Sorry . Thanks , Morgan .  Wow .  Yeah . So so they 're really going to have a huge  Especially Hawaii .  Oh . Really ?  Are they like these ,  right ?  OK .  They usually do Thursdays .  I don't get a lot of advance notice ,  but it 's al always been either Mondays or Thursdays .  So .  Yeah . They they often do it after  for a while they were doing it after this meeting .  Yeah . Wednesdays , Fridays  Definitely Wed - Definitely Wednesday I 'm not here ,  so I don't record anything .  But feel free to overlap .  No , I mean I always get scared when you do these portions where you 're not gonna overlap  because there 's less data points .  I mean , people could , like , backchannel  and ask questions and stuff .  OK .  Right .  Uh - huh .  But I don't think it 's "" aha ! "" .  It 's more like "" uh - huh ! ""  rather than "" uh - huh "" .  Great . Great .  Y y yeah . W we should talk to you off - line about something .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  But it has to be multi - stream .  Th - they  In other words , the beginning of something could be one speaker  and the end of that unit , like question - answer pair , could be a different speaker .  That 's why we can't just annotate the transcripts , uh , one listening to one at a time .  So so that 's why the Transcriber 's nice for sort of listening to it ,  but you can't actually encode , um encode someth  Yeah , exactly .  So .  It 's actually not a bad idea to say "" beep "" as a word  because you can search the transcripts , y you know , for for that , to find these places .  No , I 'm s I 'm totally serious . To have one word , like "" beep "" ,  especially with a really long "" eee "" like that .  Works great .  Wisconsin fishing .  Twentieth .  Beep .  Mm - hmm .  ",,
Bmr031.B,"Yeah . Actually we had this ide from the last time that they were here , that it 'd be nice to have UW do some work on language modeling that would be trying to get at the same detection as what we do acoustically  since they can ramp up much ques quicker in the language modeling  and we don you know , we 'll do the , uh , prosodic side .  And so this is supposed to be a project that we could actually integrate the posteriors that they get from their language model for every word boundary or every frame boundary ,  and then train up the classifiers .  And it 's I guess it 's an undergrad , too , that that 's going to be doing this work .  So .  So . Well , I 'll just really briefly , um  So , I 've been working with Don and also and and Andreas on the this paper on prosody ,  and what we 're trying to do is predict where people at  given all information up to whatever point in time you 're considering , try to predict if that 's a good location for someone else to jump in .  So , that 's the idea of that paper .  And that 's the same task that Mari , a um , a student named Dustin , and also Sarah who was at this last meeting will be looking into doing from the language modeling side .  Maybe some kind of clu you know , clustered class N - gram or something .  Um . And also we 're we 're using a couple of the labellers who are doing emotion to help us , um , finalize some transcripts for this .  So these undergra undergrad students are really helping us out a lot ,  under Don 's supervision , actually .  So that 's good .  So these offices are being , uh , very busy  Don 's and the one across from him .  And then also , um , working with Jeremy on Communicator emotion labelling .  And most of that up to a few weeks ago was just getting the people labelling these utterances to a computer for emotion  and that 's going pretty well now .  Um .  Well , we 're mostly looking for places where the person 's frustrated with the system .  There there are actually that 's how we started it .  And we had different levels .  Now we have things like "" amuse "" .  Like , "" oh , you finally got it "" .  And um , and "" disappointed - tired "" . Like , "" yeah , no , that 's wrong again "" .  Which isn't really mad ,  but , you know .  So th they gave me a lot of feedback . The labellers , after doing this ,  told me what they wanted as categories .  So . And then there 's jokes .  And  Yeah , right .  Um .  There 's not a lot of enough frustration for us to really go through quickly ,  cuz we have to label every meeting  and also things like repeats for the same information , and so forth .  And I 've been coordinating a little bit with Katrin at , uh , UW who was doing user correction work that she presented at the at the meeting .  So there 's some overlap there in what you m  there 's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration .  Um , but Jeremy 's been starting to really work on that project now from the acoustic side .  So we have all these waveforms ,  and he 's been with Morgan 's help and , uh , Dan Ellis 's , I think , looking into spectral tilt a bit ,  so he can talk about that .  It 's a feature we haven't used before .  Um , and starting to , uh , r r take information from alignments  and create a database that we can use sort of as a a large feature vector or table to feed to our decision trees ,  which will try to give us back an answer from the speech only as to whether the person 's frustrated or not .  So .  Yeah . Actually , I wanted to talk with you about that  cuz there 's a similar project at SRI where we 're using we want to do something like that to look at whether or not some of the p stylized pitch stuff is , um , sort of perceptually similar to the kinds of things that people would mark .  So , I I actually wanted to talk to you about that .  So .  OK . Yeah . Cuz this will be , like , after  OK . Yeah . This will be after September anyway ,  so I  Right .  Yeah . There was just no way to use the energy in Festival , that was  OK - Anyway . I I should move on  cuz we 're running late ,  but I wanted to say there 's one question in my mind , which maybe Morgan can talk to Jeremy about , is how to sort of normalize spectral tilt .  It 's just I 'm sort of in this , uh , area I don't know much about  and so we should talk off - line .  But if you have a certain speaker and you wanna sort of get a bunch of data from that speaker but compare it , you know , directly on a feature to to like a decision tree that won't normalize anything for you once you feed it the features , how do you sort of normalize over a particular speaker ?  What kinds of what what makes sense to do with that feature ?  So .  i Yeah .  But that 's something we would be glad to have help on .  ",,
Bmr031.B,"So . Go ahead , Jeremy .  The thing i  Yeah . We we you wanna use spectral tilt to try to get at the s n the voice quality of these utterances .  So you could have something like "" no "" versus "" no ! ""  and these might differ in that way .  But the problem is we don't know th we don't we don't know whether the "" no "" is frustrated or not .  So  Right . Exactly .  And then you also have the different speakers .  And so , the sort of question is , do you wanna average all the data together or do you do you ?  You wanna capture the change in voice quality within a speaker ,  without having to know ahead of time w which is which ,  cuz that would be circular .  So ,  u this is  But do you do this , say , just in the vowel regions ,  and do you ?  a There 's there 's a whole bunch of , um , sort of unknowns .  And we can try all of them  and just put them into the tree as features ,  and  Yeah .  Everything up to that point .  Oh , yeah . That 's OK .  That that 's the sort of w we keep you keep , uh , iterat you keep updating those numbers for future utterances .  Th - That that would work .  Yeah .  So you mean , you 're just using a mean and the varian and a variance ?  You mean just a a Z - square ,  like ?  Right , right . Right . OK .  So it is distributed in a way that you can do this . Yeah . OK .  OK . So , that 's so that was our sort of  maybe this will work ,  I don't know .  OK .  Well , we probably won't get that far . Yeah .  OK .  OK .  Yeah .  m Median , yeah .  We could just plot plot these for a speaker ,  and  get a bunch of histograms .  OK .  Right .  Thanks .  Really s really hungry fish .  It 's already dead .  ",,
Bmr031.C,"We 're we 're recording by the way ,  just for  I mean , uh u  You can keep talking .  I just I just  g guess you were gonna  Well  So the compromise is we 're we 're starting but we 're leaving the door open .  So we 'll have a little more background noise  and Uh .  Really ?  Yeah . Oh , yeah . The meeting 's started .  This is this is the real thing .  This is the real thing .  Oh well , never mind ,  it wasn't .  There goes Chuck .  Just kidding ,  it was .  OK ,  so .  OK . Last guy in gets the  Oh , you just get the door now .  Yeah .  Yeah . So I I @ @ Adam sent around this thing about what we were going to talk about  and and th we had had this discussion of , uh , flipping back and forth between an emphasis on on the technology , particularly recognition , versus , uh , the recordings and transcriptions and so on .  Um , but , um ,  I was asking , if we could , to uh , kind of make it just whatever is happening rather than one or the other  because , uh , next weekend next week I 'll be at a meeting on campus  and after that I 'll be Europe for , uh , several meetings ' worth .  Uh , you folks 'll be gone for a couple of the meetings ' worth in in Europe also ,  right ?  Really ?  OK . Yeah .  So .  So , uh , you didn't you didn't get an agenda ,  I guess . We 've got the usual  Yeah .  OK . So we sent them  And the  What pie chart ?  Half the data that 's been recorded has been transcribed ?  Wow ! That 's getting pretty good .  Mm - hmm .  Well , if we can have three point one four times as much tr transcribed as we recorded , we really would be doing well .  Uh , I thought you you were already using adaptation w on the test set .  I see .  Oh , OK .  Got it .  Right .  Right .  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , whatever this is .  Mm - hmm .  Right . Yeah .  I mean , you could have some parts of it that are disjoint and some that aren't ,  and see what the difference is , you know , on the others .  Yeah .  Yeah .  You can separate it out and see how if they 're  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah . Yeah , so , you know , maybe someone else would do a lot of the work where probably your advice  would be helpful .  Yeah . Well , we 'd  We want that for sure .  Yeah .  Uh , Dave Gelbart .  Not right away .  He 's got prelims  and  Yeah .  Um , one thing , uh , uh , just a e uh , uh , an announcement of sorts is that , um , Chuck is gonna be going to a meeting at NIST ,  in , uh , about a month and a half , I guess .  They 're still working out the date .  cuz they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff  since they 're going to be doing a bunch of meeting recordings there .  And so , uh .  Somebody you know , it 's like one person  at the moment it 's one person from each site .  So there 'll be somebody from the CMU , and somebody from here , and somebody from , uh , a a number of places .  Probably somebody from UW .  Um . So .  Yeah , it 's possible they 'll open it up to more people .  But but I think , you know , the main thing is just to ,  uh uh uh uh , it 's not a it 's not a conference .  It 's not a workshop , really .  It 's just connecting with them .  So .  Um . So , then if they start a bunch of recordings then ultimately they 'll they 'll have training sets and test sets ,  and and all that all that stuff ,  and  But .  Yeah .  I  Well , again the hope is that , uh I mean , it 's it 's looking I mean , I have to ask these folks  but , uh , my impression is that the , um , IBM path is looking , you know , more promising .  And if that 's the case and if it turns out that , uh , it 's really a relatively small amount of time  for our transcribers to process things before and after ,  if they really have taken out enough of the of the , uh , uh , work that that it 's f feasible , then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year .  I mean , next next year , uh , in which he 's you 're referring to is , uh , next year we we don't have a whole lot of guaranteed funding for this this work .  Um , other funding may come .  You know that 's But but if we wanna just count on , uh , uh , what we know about , it 's it 's more modest than this year .  Uh , it 's still there 'll still be money ,  but it 's just more modest .  So  um , so I would see us as probably not doing more recordings  at least for for for meetings or or digits or anything .  ",,
Bmr031.C,"But , uh , if if we feel that we need to , probably still doing some recordings for SmartKom or something .  Um , but otherwise just , you know , stop that  and just take whatever comes from the other places ,  which ,  uh ,  I guess we have an u unknown rate .  If it if it starts being if they 're generating this huge amount and we can't handle it then , you know , we 'll tell them .  But .  Uh , although it would have been nice if that their stuff had come earlier ,  it it 's in some ways a good thing ,  because we 've been ironing out this path .  So .  Well , it 's just if that they 're sending it to us , then we have to have the disk space to do it too .  That would be the hope .  Yeah .  d Are they doing some nice integer multiple  or ?  Are they doing some nice integer multiple of th of sixteen ?  Oh , forty - four point one .  Yeah .  Oh , so that 's  Well , you know , we record here at for at forty - eight or something  and then we downsample .  Yeah .  Well you can do it .  Oh , absolutely you can do it .  Yeah . You can do you can go from anything to anything else .  But but it 's it 's just it 's it 's just a little more complicated .  It 's just like  Yeah .  So u u u  Yeah . I mean , it 's just slightly more complicated ,  but it 's but i you can you can go from any frequency to anyth any other frequency .  So it 's  A and , so I gue  Well , I would suspect it 's because it 's what the hardware does .  Yeah .  I I I think it 's the sort of thing that 's deserving of discussion with them .  I d I don't think it 's like , i uh , they 'll ask us , we 'll give a simple answer  and come back .  It needs some back and forth  because it 's it it 's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things .  And it 's ,  um ,  i  You know , part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there 's something , you know , say , in six to ten kilohertz that you might use for for some purposes somewhere .  If people are doing a wide range of things ,  doing location ,  uh , you know , doing a bunch of things ,  maybe , you know , why why throw it away if you don't need to ?  Um , on the other hand ,  um , I mean ,  it 's @ @ sixty kilohertz is plenty .  So so  So , uh , I th I I think it 's it 's , uh  And they are gonna be using up a lot of disk ,  both for th them and for us when we 're pr processing their stuff ,  uh , if they  Well , i w wa if if they 're going at forty - four , they won't even creep .  They 'll just pounce .  Well , that might help a bit .  Yeah , actually I think at NIST they were ta there were there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too ,  so .  I don't think that 's true .  They 're recording fifty channels of mikes .  Yeah , they are .  They 're recording all of them .  Yeah .  I don't believe so .  No . I don't think so .  No . So I think they they have actually a very large audio data rate .  I think it is comparable to a video data rate .  So .  Uh .  Interesting question .  And that 's and that 's and that 's no video .  Sample rate ,  yeah .  Yeah , not if you have to distribute the video also .  Well , I think you 'll have some interesting discussions next month when you go out there .  I mean , how are they gonna you know , what 's what 's the distribution plan ?  If they have something really smart in mind , you know , maybe we can use it .  I mean I mean , w we talked about sending around a disk or a computer .  Maybe a compu maybe  That 's why it 's only fifty gigs .  Hey , it 's it 's the first time I 've ever heard you ask for less data .  Yeah , that 's probably a lot of it .  And they 're gonna have mikes like that too .  In fact , their array their array will be  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Now we bought a little not all that long ago we brought three uh , thirty - six gigabyte disks .  Uh - huh .  So I think after that we need another , uh , rack or something .  Right ?  Change servers ?  We should probably do that while we have the space left on the on the th the existing thirty - sixes ,  so that we can  shuffle it around .  Oh .  That 's right .  There are eighty gig drives now that you can get for that ?  See , and that 's probably what we should send around for these to d for distribution of this corpus .  This s s isn't any  Yeah .  Yeah . That 's what I meant ,  yeah .  Actually , what I think what what , uh  was it was it Dave who was suggesting that , uh , you just get , uh , uh , a a computer  ",,
Bmr031.C,"that has one of these drives in it  and just send the computer around to the different sites .  And you can just get it off the computer  and press the  Yeah .  Laptop ? Yeah ,  send the laptop .  And , of course you don't want y we don't want to trust the shippers necessarily ,  so you send a person too .  And they just kind of go from site to site ,  and  download their data kind of Johnny Appleseed .  Yeah .  What ?  Does it ?  Yeah . There 's a there 's a they really need it in Novosibirsk .  R r  I 'm probably pr mispronouncing it . Well .  Yeah . Mm - hmm . That that needs a month ,  yeah ,  to download .  Things are slower there .  Yeah .  OK .  So . OK , so that 's the meeting stuff .  Uh , transcrip  So you 're we 're you said it was almost half ,  so that means that we have , like , eighty or so hours  and out of that maybe thirty - five or something are transcribed ?  He 's tethered , yeah .  Oh .  Yeah .  I see .  Oh , that 's  Yeah , that 's not half .  Yeah .  A couple weeks ago . Yeah .  But about how much do we have that 's sort of , uh ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  OK .  Uh . Alright . So we still have a long ways to go  but maybe the , uh the IBM thing will will help push through the the rest of it somewhat quicker .  OK .  Yeah . It might it might partly just be European summer vacation issues .  Oh .  Right . Hmm .  OK .  Uh , www . What else is going on ?  Why don't we just go around ,  cuz we only have a few minutes .  What new hardware ?  Oh .  So , wha what 's your question ?  So what 's your question ?  Well , there 's a point when a bunch of us are off at Eurospeech .  Um .  OK .  OK .  Right .  OK .  So , I was just thinking maybe just go around and just brief briefly look what 's other things that are going on ,  maybe , since we don't don't have much of a set a set agenda  and we don't have much time .  Uh .  Well , why don't we d we we deliberately pick two people to  Yeah .  I 'll I 'll I 'll keep saying "" uh - huh "" . Yeah .  This is absolutely natural meetings .  We have absolutely no effect from our preconceptions .  With my backchannel ?  Uh - huh .  Which one it is ?  Well , has anybody done anything ?  Come on .  What are we doing ?  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Well , wait a minute ,  what ?  What 's , uh , the original Transcriber written in ?  I see .  So .  Yeah , yeah . Right .  Beep .  Not answering your calls , huh ?  "" War and Peace . ""  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I 'll I 'll take that role anytime you want .  I like saying it .  So .  OK .  OK . Any sense about how how it does on ?  Right , but I was just asking if you had a sense yet of of , uh , whether  maybe you already did this experiment ,  where there 's this question of of how much it hurt you or helped you to use segmented versus  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Good . Good .  Yeah .  So your so your results are about the same as Bush 's ,  basically . His  Bush 's .  Yeah , you 're both , you know , sort of He 's he 's coming back to the heartland  and  Right . Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . I I think he 's b he 's been he will have been off , like , two months out of his first seven in office .  That 's a pretty good deal .  Anyway .  Who are you talking about ,  Bush or Don ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Based on Hub - five , or like like your ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh !  Yeah , I mean we 're doing , uh  So I should mention , Dave and I have sort of been pushing through thinking in terms of an ASRU paper .  But I 'm still  I think early next week we 'll decide whether we 'll we 'll do one or not .  Um . But because , you know , the results are are still confusing enough that that , um ,  we we gotta be convinced we understand what 's going on .  But it 's starting to look like it it 's almost the opposite of the usual th situation where , um , you get some really nice result with , uh with digits , say ,  and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away .  Um , we had what looked like a good result in digits but th but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away .  So , uh , the digits result right now is kind of equivocal .  Um , but the conversational speech one , while not huge , is in sort of Hub - five or Meeting kind of terms ,  actually it 's it 's it 's not bad .  You know ?  So So it 's it 's you know , it 's like ,  i i w  ",,
Bmr031.C,"after he did some adjustments , more like a percent or so that that i th absolute , that it goes goes down  and  Sometimes . Yeah .  No , I 'm talking about with the adaptation .  Without the adapt without the adaptation is a much bigger effect .  So it so it 's it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way of getting this kind o kind of improvement .  But I think what w ultimately what we have to face with it is that , um  I mean , he gets incredibly good results if you artificially reverberate clean you know , close close - miked data .  So I think the thing we really have to face is that our model for what 's going on is is wrong  or incomplete ,  and that in this situation in particular there 's a lot of noise .  And noise plus reverberation is not at all the same as just reverberation .  So , um , uh , there 's that one thing that @ @ been thinking of doing , is there 's a whole lot of work that 's been going on in noise suppression in the in the Aurora , uh , team .  And so , uh , they 've got some software  and I 'm think of of just having us integrate that in ,  uh , cuz it  Yeah . Cuz it just I mean , it just subtracts it out .  In fact in fact you can run it in sort of enhancement mode where you get speech out  and and and , uh , then just run it through the rest of your recognizer .  So So , uh um .  So we 're working on that .  I mean , people have done that for a long time .  Right ?  Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper .  But I mean , that th that 's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that .  Uh , and in all th the stuff that our team is doing they certainly look at regions that you think are nonspeech in order to get noise statistics .  But , uh ,  I mean , there 's a host of thing different things you could do .  In the Aurora thing , we have we have a little bit of a handicap in that they they don't let you , uh , adjust the tis the statistical models .  So y you have to you have to do everything at the feature level .  Um . But , um , um  but there 's , uh , you know , Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction  which are , uh , sort of i can be looked at as m minor modifications of one another .  Um .  And they they 've now built up a nice piece of software that does  u um  has this sort of general framework for a for it  so that you can adjust it to sort of an any any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing  and  they found a particular set of parameters they liked this week .  And we 're running with that for a while .  But .  Anything else ?  Uh - huh .  What kind of emotions do you label ?  So , there 's just two categories , frustrated and not ,  or ? No .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That reminds me of something .  We we talked about something a ways back and I sort of lost track of it ,  about having a synthesizer driven with  Yeah , cuz you have this AS - ASRU deadline .  But that seemed like it would be fairly straight - forward , that if you take the take the pitch from the real data , feed it into the synthesizer , and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the from the real data .  Yeah .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I 'll have to hear what he 's using , f given different suggestions he 's gotten .  But  OK .  I mean , wh what specifically , what you wanna do is remove the the the the average , uh , speaker tilt in some sense ?  You don't know it .  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean ,  m maybe maybe this is too obvious to be right ,  but I mean , the the the the normal thing for C - one would be to to , uh , get rid of the mean and th and the variance .  Right ?  Does that ? The mean and variance . Have it be zero mean and unity variance .  And then  Right .  Well , the answer 's yeah .  I mean , you want you want it for every place that 's voiced .  No , ev everything for that speaker .  Yeah ?  Yeah . I mean , but but the main I think the main thing is that  the You 're right . I mean , the main distinction is whether it 's voiced or or voiced or not .  If it 's if it 's if it 's silence or or unvoiced regions , then you you you don't really want that in there , uh , if you can help it .  But actually , I mean , just to first order , suppose you just didn't do anything smart at all  and just did you know , did that , it wouldn't be that bad .  Because you 'd get some number that would be skewed by be skewed by that  You know , uh , uh , X - X X X - X X minus mu over sigma . Yeah .  ",,
Bmr031.C,"It it it 's it 's sort of the first - order thing to do .  There 's , uh , you know , uh , obviously much much more arcane things to do and complicated things to do .  But that 's th that 's the first thing to do .  And then you know , then the next thing is , "" well , let 's just look at the voiced regions "" ,  you know , and that would be a reasonable thing to do .  And then if it 's really when you look at what y i i i  Since you 're looking at something that 's sort of in log domain , cepstral is like log d linearly transformed of a log domain , it 's probably not that terrible an assumption to pretend it 's Gaussian anyway .  And so the other things that get more more tricky are , uh , to handle the fact that it 's not not really Gaussian .  And and y you may you may not really need that for this .  Yeah . So I think that would be that would be the obvious thing to do .  No , I understand .  It 's just it it  No , it 's more that that if you felt something wasn't Gaussian and you were trying to normalize for some kind of , uh , bias of some sort , you might use a non - parametric measure ,  like you might use a median ,  you know ,  and rank statistics , and all that sort of stuff .  But I mean , you shouldn't bother with it if it 's roughly Gaussian .  Just  Yeah .  Sure .  Uh , and I already I already said what I was doing ,  which is mostly trying to give advice to Dave when he he he actually does the real work on this , uh , reverberation thing .  But I think it 's it 's it 's a real , uh it 's a real learning experience for both of us .  And and , uh , I think it 's it 's a problem ar problem area that people really haven't dealt with that much , as we know .  So , uh , w h he kind of did he started off with what was in some sense sort of the first obvious thing to do ,  although hardly anybody had done it yet .  And , uh , it it does work very well under some conditions  and other conditions it doesn't .  And now we 're understanding trying to understand what those are .  It - it 's it 's it 's fun .  Do you want to add some anything ? to say anything ?  How was y Did you catch fish ,  or ?  No . No fish . OK .  You know , when Bush catches fish  they actually put a bunch of fish in the lake for him .  I 'm I 'm not kidding .  Really . They just they they pre - stocked it with with a a  I 'm really not kidding .  Yeah . So we 're ready to increase our federal funding .  Why why don't we ?  Yeah , let 's do that .  I still don't know if these are gonna be any good  but it sure does get us out of here quicker .  A one , and a two , and a three .  And you were worried we wouldn't have any overlap today .  ",,

Let me check with Robert again ,  but I I 'm pretty sure that there 's nothing this week .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I 'm  Yeah .  I don't like the backchannels at all ,  as that 's really a problem with the speech - nonspeech detection .  So  Yeah . I 've been doing a bunch of recognition experiments on meeting data with different , uh , segmentations with different different automatic segmentations ,  but it 's not yet finished .  It 's work in progress .  Yeah . For , uh for for the paper I w I want to submit to ASRU to to , uh , evaluate the quality of the speech - nonspeech detection by using it for speech recognition .  It  Yeah .  So , it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation , when you have the the manual segmentations ,  where you have exact boundaries for each s utterances .  Sometimes there are some some words are cut off  or there 's some segments i are s uh , assigned to s to speech which there is nothing in .  And so there are more insertions  but most of the time there are more the the number of deletions is higher when when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one .  And so I 'm just in in progress of , yeah , trying to feed the recognizer with un - segmented data  and to see how much worse that is .  So that that I have three things .  Un - yeah un - segmented , the automatic , and the the ideal one .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I haven't really had time to do that .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Maybe after Wednesday ?  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  ",,
Bmr031.E,"Right . So I 've been looking at spectral tilt  and different ways of perhaps generating it .  And , um , I basically have three ways right now that we 're looking at for , uh we 're gonna look at for features .  Uh , one is just looking at , um , the first cepstral coefficient  and , uh , using that .  Um , another is looking at the log ener the difference of log energies between , um , the high like a high - frequency band and a low - frequency band .  And the third is just , um , taking a slope , um , of the linear fit of the spectrum and using that .  So , those are the three three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers .  And , um ,  hopefully soon we can look at some of the labelled stuff  and look at , uh , these numbers and see see which ones w seem to be working well . And things like that .  Um , I also recently wrote a script , um , that , uh , generates the kappa statistic ,  um , which is a for labeller agreement .  Um , so , been looking at that as well .  ",,
Bmr031.F,"OK . We 're on .  Oh , we 'll wait for Chuck .  Close the door behind him .  Y you can keep talking ,  but you should be aware .  Well , and then , uh then Morgan said "" why don't we start ? ""  and I said "" O K "" .  Or we can close the door and make Chuck knock when he comes .  And Chuck gets stuck with the ear - plug mike .  But he didn't shut the door .  I got it  since  Well , because no one no one ever rep responded with any items .  So I have a couple of minor ones .  Uh ,  our normal transcription status ,  just so that we can make some some plans .  So wha what 's up with IBM , Chuck ?  Do you know ?  Is is yours working there , Chuck ?  Can you ?  You 're b you 're B ?  There 's no on .  Oh . It 's just  I 'll Let me raise the gain on that a little bit  since it 's so far from your mouth .  Sorry .  OK .  Pie ?  Oh .  OK . So also , um  Now , that 's a strange  Yep .  Um . So  How much  How much do we need transcribed before it 's worth doing some trainings ?  I mean , it seems like probably we have enough now .  Right ?  Because , like like Macrophone wasn't that much data .  Right ?  And it helped .  You only used that for digits ?  Right .  That 's right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Cool .  Um .  Supervised .  H how would you imagine doing a test set on this corpus ?  A test set , training set division ?  I mean , it it 's really weird .  Right ?  Because it 's it would be hard to get speaker disjoint sets .  Do y do we just give up on that ?  Well , but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question .  Right .  So .  Yeah .  Right .  And then s s similarly with subject matter .  That , you know , if you 're training your language model on this meeting only and testing on this meeting only , you 're gonna do a lot better than if you start crossing them .  Are the same .  Sure .  Just from word choice ?  Most certainly . So it 's just , uh , if we 're gonna do that we should give some thought to how we wanna divide it up .  Yeah . And similarly with digits . We now have a lot of digits  but most of them aren't transcribed .  So if we wanted to do a forced alignment on them , we could start collecting ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus .  And so , same issue .  You know we just need to get someone who 's interested in that to start looking at it .  So who 's working on digits currently ?  OK , maybe I 'll talk to him and see if he 's interested .  Yeah , certainly .  He wants to pass the prelims .  Mm - hmm .  Is , uh ? Are the CMU folks gonna be there ?  Right .  Right .  Yep .  It it pretty good .  Yeah .  Um . Well , I got a email from one of the UW guys .  They want to record the meetings at higher , uh , sampling rate than sixteen kilohertz .  Uh ,  I didn't ask why .  But it seems to me that really doesn't matter .  If they have the disk space to do it , it seems that that is not a big deal .  I was just wondering if anyone had an opinion about mismatched rates .  Yep .  Excuse me ?  No .  No . No , no , it was like forty something .  Forty - four ,  forty - two .  Yeah .  Something like that .  And then we downsample . Yep .  You get aliasing .  Well , the the only thought was if we 're gonna do a combined corpus , does it really matter if some 's sampled at one rate and some 's sampled at the other ?  My feeling is no , it doesn't .  Your audio , u these days audio tools tend to take care of all of that .  But I just wanted to double check with other people before I told them "" yeah , no problem "" .  That 's what I was saying .  So so  I don't know .  Why are they asking us ?  Because , you know , we 're sort of doing the corpus ,  so they want to be as similar as possible .  So . But I think the answer is , if if we tell him "" no , that 's not alright "" , what he 'll probably say is "" well , we 're gonna do it anyway "" .  But , uh ,  Uh .  Yep .  Oh , and they just don't want to downsample ?  OK .  Yep . That 's wh that 's what I thought .  Mm - hmm .  Yep . Yep .  Yeah , but  Um , I don't remember what their hardware set - up was  but it was smaller than ours .  Yeah .  Well , with NIST I think  they 're they 're in a different situation cuz they 're doing video .  And so compared to the video , the audio is just noise  in terms of disk space ,  literally .  Really ?  They 're not recording all fifty of the array .  They 're they 're cooking it down ,  aren't they ?  Whew .  That 's funny .  ",,
Bmr031.F,"I thought that they were cooking down that data in some way before they were storing it .  Yeah , distributing  They 're not going to .  You 'll have to just work on little subsets of it .  There 's just no way you could get it all .  Yep .  Sixteen .  A lot .  Two or three ?  It 's a lot more than that .  Right ?  DVD is eight gig ?  I think that 's definitely the right way to do it .  Someone sends us disk .  We we load it with data and send it back .  It 's gonna be easier than any other method .  Well , if not if you want to burn the C Ds , you 're welcome to it .  Well , yeah .  Yeah , absolutely . If they have a way of doing it .  I 'm thinking prior to that .  We already do that .  Shorten does that automatically .  That 's why you why that 's why Shorten that 's why Shorten reduces the size so much .  Right .  Yep .  Well , if you talk less it does in fact use less me d m data .  So , the channels  Hmm .  It 's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short .  Then you can be pretty sure that the mike was off .  And , the t unfortunately the tabletop ones  the six tabletop which we record all the time no matter how many people are there , uh , don't compress nearly as well  because they 're almost always have signal on them .  Yep .  Most of them .  Yep . So they won't shorten nearly as well .  And I assume they 're gonna do it lossless .  Yeah .  Yep . Absolutely .  And then maybe one far - field .  You know ?  It 's things or the mixed channel .  Yeah , I think there are a lot of ways to do it ,  but Let 's not worry about that now .  How are we on disk space , Chuck ?  Mm - hmm .  Good .  Yeah , we 're using those for the for the expanded .  Yeah . The problem with that for backed - up media is , uh , the sysadmins wanna keep them at eighteen meg eighteen gig partitions  because that takes about a day to get off back - up tape .  So .  For u the whole institute .  Yeah .  Actually , going to bigger disks we can do even ,  and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions .  You just partition them into multiple .  So that 's probably the next step ,  is to get the eighty or ninety gig drives to replace the thirty gig or an eighteen gig that we have now .  Yeah . Yeah .  A whole handful of microdrives .  Is is the areal density of the microdrive higher than of a w normal drive ?  It must be .  Yep .  Well , they have the two gig already .  And I 'm I 'm just thinking forty of them is probably still smaller in area than , uh , one normal - sized drive .  Yep .  Yeah . A laptop .  Eighty gig laptop .  I 'll I 'll do that .  It uh , uh , unfortunately it takes me a week at each site .  It does take a week at each site .  So .  Yeah , a absolutely . If it 's a nice site .  Yeah , right .  Th - that only takes a day or so .  Anyway .  Yep .  Definitely true .  Any other items ?  I I saw the pie chart sticking out ,  so .  D d do we care ?  We need different color pens , definitely .  Rustle , rustle .  Oh ! Great .  Oh .  So I should probably send those to you ,  shouldn't I ?  There are five .  There are five .  We have five where , uh , everyone has replied .  It was falling off , uh .  And there 's still , uh , two people for whom I have not been able to get in touch  have never gotten a response from from any of the emails about , uh permission forms .  So .  Yep .  That 's so that 's why the NSA ones have still not been approved . Though .  Yep .  Possibly . It 's been , like , four months ,  so .  Oh , that 's right .  Uh .  Yeah , we have new hardware .  So , I want to set it up at some point ,  so I just wanted to know what meeting schedules were .  Uh , we have several more wireless channels  so that we can set up  and get rid of these , uh the wired stuff completely .  And then also we got replacements for these mikes .  Yeah .  Yeah , they 're like those .  Those are the only two choices right now , unfortunately .  Question is , when are we not recording any meetings for a couple days  so that I can do it  and if it doesn't work , we won't impact people .  So .  So , what 's SmartKom ?  End of next week .  And is EDU still recording ?  So if I did it , like , tomorrow that would be alright it sounds like ?  OK .  So it sounds like no one n  No one early next week .  OK .  And then I 'll also re - number  so that , uh , the mikes are in order .  Should help with the transcripts .  They wer so right now the channel numbers are discontiguous .  Right .

Bmr031.F,"Which "" uh - huh "" ?  That 's a  I mean , I 'll start if you want .  I 've been , uh , most recently rewriting Transcriber in Java for no particular reason .  Uh .  Well , I mean , Trans - What happened was that Transcriber 's very slow to load .  So when you have a big meeting it c uh , especially on a slower machine , it can take five minutes before you can start doing anything .  And so I was thinking about why that was  and the data structures I would use ,  and I found myself unable not to sit down and code it .  So I did .  And so I have a big chunk of Transcriber now written in Java  and it comes up , you know , in a couple of seconds .  Um .  I It 's not really probably not worth doing .  But we can talk about it .

B uh  We can  Well , we already use it for digit training .  I mean  Well , we did do some training on digits  uh , rather adaptation on digits digits .  I mean , supervised adaptation .  So .  Yeah . I mean , uh  Well ,  I would I would love to do some , um  you know , with adaptation you can use fairly small amount of data to improve your performance .  Um , and  n you know , it 's just basically ,  uh uh  You know , I I don't have to time to to do too much these days  except what I 'm already doing .  So  um , but if there 's some someone has some free time , I 'm I 'll be happy to show them how it works  and you can play with it .  No , supervised adaptation .  So , we 're doing s unsupervised speaker adaptation .  But you could build a test set which you sort of take your models and ada do supervised adaptation .  And then you start with the speaker adaptation from sort of channel - adapted  or room - adapted  or whatever .  Right .  It 's it 's sort of like in , um , Broadcast News  because you have those people who re - occur over and over .  I mean , the anchor speakers tend typically .  So ,  um m m m m  Yeah . As long as you 're aware that you 're doing that , that 's I don't see that as a problem .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  But it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap , for instance .  It could be interesting .  Well , it will be interesting to find out why they are choosing a higher sampling  But then they 're just they 're just there 's just deferring the problem to later  and they might save themselves a lot of disk space problems by doing it right away .  I mean that 's wha  That 's like three times three times as much disk space .  We should warn them that these disk space issues are gonna creep up on them very fast .  Linguistic Data Consortium .  We should just talk less .  Uh , OK .  So f so for dis  for distribution purposes it might make sense to split it by channel , uh , rather than by meetings .  So , you could distribute , like , only the near - field signals , uh , uh , uh , together for a bunch of meetings  and then have a second row .  Yeah .  Right .

That would th w  s  Well , actually , I think it is worth doing  because here 's the thing . We 're sort of we 're starting to move from transcription to annotation .  And the Transcriber interface is fine if essentially what you 're doing is stringing words together to p to make transcripts .  But , um , in for instance , what we 're doing now w with , uh , Communicator data , but which we would like to do with Meeting data , is to actually label utterances , or words , or whatever units you want with , uh , you know , basically doing a multiple choice type of labelling .  And for those type of tasks , it wou it 's much more efficient to present , uh , the th p present a bunch of , uh , clickable buttons or whatever  and , um  And and th that 's actually a good model , which is what this current tool that we 're using has , is to atta to associate these labels with , um , attributes of SGML tags .  So , you know , you have , say , a tag for  I don't know  what type of utterance ,  whether it 's a question or a statement or whatever .  And then you have an , uh you know , an a tag attribute  and the value of that encodes the choice .  Oh , you mean display as in showing the waveform ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , but we didn't have the exact comparison .  But you know , there were i i  the experiments were based on different segmentations and different transcripts .

And , uh ,  so they 've been getting from us the , um you know , some support in terms of getting the latest transcripts  and the also the actually the , uh , transcripts annotated with events ,  uh , like sentence boundaries and stuff like that .  Um , because one of Mari 's students was to wants to do some language modeling for , uh , predicting overlaps and , uh , stuff like that .  Um .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Um , on the recognition side , actually , um , I think the main person doing that is , uh , Harriet from Harriet Nock from , uh formerly of Cambridge .  Um , and apparently they get reasonable results  except in some portions they get very high insertion rates  even higher than we get with with the , um like even , you know , on lapel mikes with , uh , background speech .  And so they were trying to track that down ,  and  It could be that our recognizer 's actually doing relatively well  because it has a reject model for , you know , mismatched speech , essentially ,  or for unspecified speech .  And , um , so  so , uh , they 'll I sent them our recognition output  so they can sort of do a line - by - line comparison  and see if if they , um you know , their insertions correspond to our rejects and stuff like that .

And we 've got several  we ' v we 've still got , uh , quite a bit of space on the , uh , un - backed - up .  So .  But I I think it 's probably we should start thinking about where to go next ,  especially on the backed - up disk space .  That 's the un - backed - up .  Yeah . Those are the u  So , for example , the , uh Guenter 's Wall Street Journal data went onto one of those ,  uh , some other experiment things that people are doing are on there ,  and  So . If you put it there people will use it .  Yeah . So .  Have to change servers , actually .  Well , we could we could There are a bunch of disks that we have , uh , that are s s smaller .  And they 're , like , seventeen .  We could go to thirty - five .  So we could get some extra space out of that .  But the s right now the server 's full .  We couldn't add any more disks .  We could change a smaller disk for a larger one .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , then there 's the other issue is that to g to g add more disk now , um , David says we really need to go to new servers .  But he wants to go to new servers not just for us  but for other groups too .  So there 's this sort of coordination issue ,  and  I guess I need to talk to him more about  Yeah .  Well , when they come out with an  When they come out with the eighty gig microdrive then we 'll just send one of those little things around with all the meeting data .  Yeah . The the pie chart shows actually m meetings that are ,  uh  it combines the categories of , you know , "" currently in ""  Oh ! Well , I 've got it right there , I think .  Yeah . There 's there 's just a few , uh ,  Um . Yeah ,  except I I 'm tethered .  Uh ,  OK .  It combines categories .  So when we say "" transcribed "" , we mean either in the process of being transcribed , either here or at IBM ,  or completed transcription ,  and it also includes , uh , checked .  So it includes a lot of categories together .  So .  And that I think that that status thing is kinda old actually right now .  That one that you have ?  Yeah .  The  the date on this one is July twenty - sixth ,  so , uh , I have to update it .  Yeah .  So we have total number of meetings is seventy - eight meetings  and , uh , uh ,  the total meeting time is seventy - five hours .  And , um So ,  the ones that are finished being transcribed , as opposed to in the process of being transcribed  we 've got twenty - six hours that are finished being transcribed .  Um . So there 's , uh , several processes to the transcription .  There 's , uh  I it ranges from being assigned to a transcriber , to them finishing transcription , to then being checked ,  you know , with a double - check .  And so , when we say the total transcribed , that 's the one that 's gone through being checked , I believe .  I think that 's what the I have here .  But not yet approved .  And then there 's , uh the final one is approved for release .  That 's after the meeting participants have gone through it .  Yeah , if you know .

My impression on this proposal is that every single block has some research done already .  So , multicast . This means that there are many things done .  Oh , what was it ?

Bns001.B,"OK .  OK .  OK .  Hi .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  OK ,  thank you Joe .  Well , I , uh , as all of you know I came from from Spain ,  from the uh Polytechnic University of Valencia  and i uh I um , just finished my PHD thesis about uh um power - saving techniques for wireless networking .  uh , In fact , I have developed an algorithm to control the ra radio frequency power uh of a wireless transceiver .  And , uh I 've been working also in routing issues , especially in the so - called ad - hoc netw wireless networks .  Where uh , you have a set of , uh , mobile nodes and , no other infrastructure ,  no base stations .  So all the routing functions are done by the node by the same nodes .  OK ?  So , nodes act as both end points and routers .  eh  I 've in the study for some time these kind of networks .  And , uh , in fact , there are a lot of of research uh articles about this this kind of networks because You know , uh , mmm infrastructure - based network network has been a long topic of research .  So ,  for example , routing on on wired networks is a a topic still to be researched  but it has an important background .  But mobile network this kind of mobile networks is a little bit uh newer ,  especially because uh , until not so long uh , the the things were too heavy to have a computer , a wireless transceiver , on a more or less portable thing .  So , with the advent of this new technology , low power uh , high , uh , processing capability and wireless eh networking capability , in a really small package , new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing , in the market .  And , eh , well this is more or less what I have done .  And the kind of , uh , things , I 'm interested is more or less all , around this these kind of networks .  But I could say , uh in general , mobile service is not only about , uh these specific kind of networks .  But , in general , about , uh services uh over mobile or services that can benefit from the uh , capability of nodes to move around .  And , uh , well , I I 've been teaching now for twelve years , comp eh At a computer sciences school in my university ,  I 've been teaching computer networks .  And , well , I am more or less uh , knowledgable about , well , TCP IP networking , ISO uh , networking ,  and , uh  well I 'm I 'm a computer guy ,  so I 'm really um Well , I can say uh , proudly uh , more or less , computer skilled .  I mean , uh , operating systems uh , programming languages uh , networking @ @ .  So this kind of things I think I 'm more or less well - trained .  So  this is , I think , um , my first presentation .  Next maybe next meeting I will uh , do a small sketch about uh , my past work , and well , presenting some det a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and and some things from previous talks , so you can have a better idea of w the kind of work I 've been doing .  OK ?  Thank you .  Y  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's OK .  OK .  OK .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Well , like have a blueprint .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  And you can build a a an a a double technology adapter , too .  So you can market these double - technology adapters .  And , this can be a a potential uh um you know , uh , income , too .  Because you just have to license , uh uh WaveLAN technology .  You can build , uh , the whole thing .  This U - UMTS WaveLAN , uh mixed together .  Mmm .  I think , they are using different , uh , radio technologies .  So , uh , at the physical level , they 're they 're they are not compatible .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That that 's right .  Yeah but I I have a point uh regarding the this question , is eh the cost function .  I mean .  uh  What about the user who is switching from one let 's say zero - cost area network to another network where he has to pay .  It is OK for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another .  But probably , the user wants to be aware that he 's switching from one place from one network to another .  Because maybe , while he 's uh having , let 's say , a vide video conference uh over the the WaveLAN oh he 's not paying any extra cost .  But when he continues with this service on the UMTS , he 's having to cover uh an important let 's say , an important cost or some cost , non - null cost .  So uh  this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of .  Of course , this doesn't mean that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches . to the w uh r uh from the zero - cost area network to to the uh um non - null cost area network .  But maybe some users want to do this .  ",,
Bns001.B,"Because they say "" OK  I 'm not willing to pay any back for this service ,  because I 'm just watching uh you know the sports news .  So , if I switch If if , because of my motion , I 'm switching , or I 'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network , well , I I want the service to be uh stopped . ""  And this can be some pattern then that some users will follow .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  But when quality of service comes to the uh scene , well , I think we have a a bigger problem  because maybe this this uh uh seamless migration cannot be seamless at all ,  because maybe the the quality of service we are getting when we are connected to a certain network , let 's say high - speed networking , cannot be sustained when we are switching to a different technology .  So , this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our our scheme  or  OK .  Yeah .  Oh , sorry .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It can be done .  It is just Mmm uh Trying to to to to poi to pinpoint The the possible problems .  Yeah .  In fact , if you take the slower technology of the ones you are planning to to support , you can offer this warran this uh this throughput as uh the minimum warranty you you can get .  So , if everybody is is asking for less than this minimum amount , no problem at all .  But in this case , maybe not too much effort should be put on providing this quality of service  because you just have a usually a huge bandwidth compared on a a w with what the user is is using .  I mean , if you have a ten megabits bandwidth and the user is asking two kilobits per second , of course , you can uh build uh certain reserve mechanisms to warranty the user these two kilobits per second bandwidth .  But probably in it isn't it is not worth because you have so many uh available bandwidths that maybe uh it is not a problem .  Hi .  Oh , OK .  Have you have you read about this uh Barwan project held at Berkeley University ?  Yeah .  OK .  Barwan .  Barwan .  Uh da it was another related project called Daedalus .  And uh well it seems they what they were doing was some kind of uh things si somehow similar to this .  u  Uh Don't know .  I I I I just uh take a a quick uh look at the at the thing  because I I was uh read about this uh a long time ago .  And it the the latest report I I found was in nineteen ninety eight .  And in this report , well , they they pres they have uh some slides , some uh papers , some well , a lot of things .  And well the main thing and the quick uh thing I I was uh looking at was a a video available in MP - thr in MPG M - peg format .  And uh  well what this video was presenting was a kind of test of of one guy with a portable computer , moving across different networks .  So starting at the CS department at Berkeley  and then going out the street  switching to the a campus - wide network ,  uh um I think it 's a Metricom uh network ,  an which is uh a test  Ricochet ,  yeah ,  that 's right .  And then , finally switching to I think it was city PD or something like this .  OK .  I as lo uh as the as the user is moving out of the of the coverage area of this second network .  And , well , what they have built is a a kind of uh proxy structure .  So they are they are putting most of the work of this adaptational layer on on the side of the proxies .  So the client or the server is not changed .  It is the proxy , the one that does the work .  OK ,  so you can even , for example , use  It 's the same ?  Oh , OK .  OK ,  I  It is just that that well , maybe we can we can take a look at oh maybe a more in - depth look at this project  just to see if we are doing the same , or if we are doing something similar .  It would be important for us to to highlight the differences .  Because if not , well , they can say , "" Oh , you are doing the same thing . ""  "" This was done now . ""  Yeah , well we are close .  Yeah .  No problem .  Yeah ,  UC Ber - uh Berkeley ,  yeah .  I 'll I you uh I seen uh uh reports from nineteen ninety uh ninety - six , ninety - seven and ninety - eight .  Maybe the project  n uh  I think that that the leader was uh Professor Katz .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah  b le let me let me ask you a question about eh UMTS or or third or possible fourth generation communic wireless communication systems .  Uh , from the point of view of the user , uh is there uh something more that nnn , that than more speed ?  Is there any other advantage , from the point of view of the user or of of the terminals ?  Yeah .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  ",,
Bns001.B,"Hmm - hmm - hmm .  But in fact  But in fact now , at the GSM level , what you have is that every voice channel you use provides a a p a pretty fine fixed uh data speed .  So , we can say that every voice channel has an i an incr uh implied um quality of service ,  which is nnn ninety six hundred bits per second .  Full duplex .  Doesn't it ?  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  No , but um but not only because of of data speed ,  but also about delay ,  you know ,  because GSM networks were developed to y uh with a voice service in mind .  Ah , delay is also considered in these networks .  So ,  uh , in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter , and a a a specified um data speed .  So you can scale up scale up this uh this um thing by using several channels .  So , in fact , you have , using just GSM technology , you have more or less the same building blocks as you can get uh with the UMTS .  I mean that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different ,  that uh the base station thing is different  and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different  but from the point of view of the mobile things uh I 'm not sure if if  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , but The You know , it is also being d uh developed , this G uh P - DPRS thing , GPRS thing .  which is uh pack uh packet data over GSM .  So ,  I mean . Uh , I don't see that a a lot of difference .  We can expect a lot of differences f uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view . Uh , when uh UMTS be deployed .  What I 'm trying to say is that is that well , uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a UMTS expert  because uh I I don't see it I think that the UMTS thing is more a technology issue , than a research issue .  Maybe I 'm wrong .  Just es  um  explaining my m  I mean to be done here ,  not not at the  of course , you know , I 'm I I agree with you that there are a lot o of things to be developed  but But the point is that uh this is probably not here .  Because uh well , you know the the the orientation of our group which is uh "" Networks Services and Applications "" , not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology .  Yeah .  You know , radio frequency technology ,  wide - band w uh CDMA .  These kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched .  But uh I don't think w this is not something we are doing here .  Voice ,  yeah .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Yeah .  One question .  I have a an important doubt about the IP availability over UMTS .  I mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing  and uh I 'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation .  I mean , are they maintaining are they holding the same web technology ?  Or , are ju just they discarding this technology  and forgetting about the thing ?  I I don't know what will happen .  uh , I I don't have a clue .  Probably , if after searching a little bit on the on the net I can get the answer ,  but initially this is something to to to have in mind .  I mean . Because maybe this UMTS thing will appear on the market without IP as a native protocol .  And if this is the case well , thus seamless integration could be we strongly affected .  At least , uh , if you we want to use U M  I 'm I 'm just uh throwing the question .  uh I mean , looking for an answer  because I don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this .  I don't know what what carriers are planning to do about this .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  No .  No .  Not me .  Mmm .  In Spain it 's available  but uh you know , uh my main complaint has been all the time that it is difficult to me to believe that I can do interesting work with a 4 lines display .  Ah Maybe , check the lottery result or something like this ,  but  Huh - huh - huh .  Well  I I don't know what will  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  u  Let me let me propose a a a a reasoning way .  Uh let 's assume that we are successful with this proposal ,  so we get the funding to do whatever what we want to do .  So my question is , what we want to do is ?  Let 's assume that we have the funding .  What will be our first and or or and second steps ?  Ah , what kind of things uh we eh we will buy ,  what kind of things we will eh program or we will deploy ?  Because answering this these questions we can know much better what the application we want .  So let 's assume  Yeah .  Absolutely .  Let let me put an example .  ",,
Bns001.B,"You know I Some days ago , I bought , like some of you , this kind of things .  This is a PDA  eh three com uh Palm Pilot compatible ,  nothing nothing that great ,  but it has some some possibility of being expanded .  But the point is eh , the only in here The only thing wireless thing I can put on on this is just uh this Omnisky modem ,  which is uh , I think it is a subscription - based uh thing .  You have to pay every every month ,  and eh of course , I cannot imagine that uh tomorrow I 'll be able to buy a different thing with four different networks ,  four different providers on it .  Maybe I 'm wrong  but  if I have the funding I say "" OK , well , I can buy this or even I can buy a mobile computer ,  a notebook "" .  OK ?  A lot more expensive ,  but that 's OK ,  I have the funding  Then I can add a couple of cards at most ,  because mmm the majority of the of the notebooks only have two PC cards uh type two slots .  So  In in the better case , maybe I 'm only able to add two different networks to this thing .  So ah  the difficulty I see is that ah if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um , maybe we are uh too advanced too , um , let 's say , uh too in advance for the current technology .  Which is not bad ,  but uh , I 'm just saying that it will be able It will  Sorry .  It will be difficult for us to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology .  If somebody tell us , "" OK , now here you have the thing , and just put these four networks you want on the thing . "" How can I do it now ?  So mmm  I 'm still trying to you know , to get used to the uh all the ideas  and to see that all the things are really connecting  because this the eh most difficult thing I see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align .  So that 's why I was proposing this this question .  Let 's assume we have the funding .  Now let 's proceed .  What what kind of things we can buy , we can put together , we can program .  Because oh at the end uh somebody will uh be asking us "" OK , did you do your homework ?  Did you do what you  So .  Mm - hmm .  But for different networks ?  The point is for  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm .  I think so  Oh yeah .  W  A long way , yeah .  That 's right .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm .  OK .  Bless you .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  OK  Yeah .  But  Hmm - mmm .  Yeah .  Yeah . Sure .  Yeah .  And and  Mm - hmm .  N Not only this .  We can even use this u platform to to get some European projects in the future  because you know , sometimes eh it 's a good thing  Yeah but uh , this will I think w This will improve over time , I 'm sure .  So uh  Probably .  You know , this kind of joint work of different countries de companies , universities . This is usually the best ah the best place to to put a project on .  Because it is involving different partners from different points of of Europe .  Hm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Uh .  Unless unless we speak about quality of service ,  which is not eh embedded on on IP services .  Yeah , but  Yeah but for example nobody 's really using RSVP .  OK , sorry , sorry .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  That 's right .  Well , if Klaus  OK .  OK  OK ,  yeah , that 's right .  Oh , can you call Adam ?  At this number ?  ",,
Bns001.C,"No .  This afternoon you mean ?  No , this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks  wha  Yeah , and This probably has to be a brainstorm right now .  Um What I told Joachim yesterday was that , uh uh for my company the company I work for , they are more interested in in an explicit service , than in core technology .  u  Me , on the other hand , I 'm more interested in uh , core service , or c core technology , myself .  So I 'm u I was thinking about uh , how I could combine the both of them .  KPN was , um they 're interested in having , uh like , six people or something , working on the project for one year  or maybe , uh , three people fo working on the project for two years ,  and have a kind of a demonstration uh , for a specifically in UMTS service .  I was thinking that um as a well , not really a UMTS service , but yesterday , what I discussed with Joachim was uh , a w little bit based on your ad - hoc networking also .  That it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from w a WaveLAN Technology to , um , UMTS .  I think that 's , uh , it 's in in the future that will be a main competitor of , uh , of UMTS ,  too , like the the the Lucent , uh , equipment has a l huge scope already ,  like five hundred feet , or or even more sometimes .  so that 's it 's might be interesting for , a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network .  You can switch from UMTS or uh uh , to WaveLAN Technologies .  Sure .  Of course , it sounds strange for a company that does UMTS to switch to to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to WaveLAN  but at the end it makes it easier for your and cheaper for your customers .  So , if they don't do it , somebody else will probably do it .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  and  Yeah , something like that could be possible ,  maybe even a UMTS - to - WaveLAN - gateway ,  or I 'm not sure if that 's possible like we U - if UMTS re contains redirects or whatever , like switches .  I 'm not sure about it .  It could be .  It 's not a problem .  No , but s You could have a UMTS gateway that translates everything to that uh w local @ @ .  If you will  Yes .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Well ,  If connection is lost , I am I 'm not sure if sometimes you 'd simply have to drop a connection . If you have outstanding connections .  But that 's uh one thing of the internet ,  right ?  It 's should be able to unplug a host , bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be .  I 'm not sure i if it 's uh if you really have to con uh save a connection for all applications ,  I I don't think so .  Oh , the one I have Sitcom ?  Yeah .  Um .  Well , the switching itself could be a problem .  Becau - well it 's a depends  if one of the other networks is available , maybe you are ,  I don't know .  So that could be a t topic for research ,  so maybe you know more about it .  Yeah .  Y Yes .  Um .  If if you can leave it out the network that will be really cool .  That 's what you w what I would like to do ,  so  Yes .  The the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those uh four areas .  So  So we  So so we went through uh uh to through multicast .  So this architecture with m  well , at least no wireless environment or a mobile IP environment , comparable to uh UMTS environments . We really did not find any well , difficulties there .  On the blackboard , that is .  Of course , in real life there will b probably be some problems .  Iceberg ?  You mean the Iceberg project ?  Barwan of uh ES  I know there 's one that 's of uh Randy Katz .  Yes .  They worked together wi little bit with Nokia ?  Palo Alto ?  Mountain View ?  Hmm .  Yeah .  I like them  so  Yeah .  Or maybe talk to them about s operations they thought of but didn't touch yet .  I was  Wh - when did you go through this ?  Cuz yesterday I was uh Well coincidentally , I b bumped into this project here .  It 's funny .  Yeah , yesterday I was just surfing a little bit .  And then from Nokia I came to this that project ,  so .  Nokia research .  And then  That 's right .  And he 's also board in Nokia research ,  so  Well , just to make the list a little bit longer .  May  Um , you could also think about uh session management .  I do along with uh the network applications and services , uh as you might know .  It 's a a  if you can do it in the end systems or at sp specific servers , then , I 'm in favor of that .  But se session management , I mean uh the authentication , if you go from one network to the other , it 's not solved .  uh ,  Nobody really wants a a guest on your network .  ",,
Bns001.C,"Unless you get some money through some way uh through some way .  Then , there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the Barwan project , as you said , go through proxies .  There might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies ,  like the zip uh s zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit .  That that 's als I think also in the line of uh session management .  Then there is this uh perfect thing uh the Berkeley sockets .  It 's almost perfect .  They s kind of skipped uh layer five , uh session management or session layer , I think .  That 's um normally with if you do a socket programming , it 's directly the prot application protocol on layer four , uh TCP socket , or layer five for UDP socket .  There might also be some research  Well ,  could you introduce such a session management ,  or  Norm - what they do right now is they make it part of the application - level protocol .  That 's what they do most often .  Like with session management ? for mobile the uh applications such as ist instant messaging or uh talks , and so on , uh like zip . It 's just doing a a reconnect .  If they think that the network is different or different capabilities come into play , they simply do a reconnect  so it 's part of the protocol .  That 's all what I think about session management ,  like part of in proxies or is it en embedded in application level protocols ?  I it 's  So how do you want to focus on network services .  Well the  So "" network applications "" , if you look at the name of the group , one thing is that um the they used to call a a n a "" network "" that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network .  If you look at "" network "" from the OZ layer , then it 's uh , level two or something or maybe level three , but everything below three .  So there are , I think , two two different interpretations of uh "" network "" .  But are there "" network applications "" , then ?  So , the the name is "" Network Services and Applications "" ,  s so what could be an en example of a network application if you look at the OZ stick ?  OK .  OK , OK , well , they will I didn't want to get a discussion now .  Well , think it works ,  but uh  yes , the mapping of course between multicasting and the UMTS or or whatever  That 's or CDMA or whatever that 's uh , yeah , probably a thing that has to be find out .  I don't know what statuses .  Maybe they already did it par as part of UMTS ,  I 'm not sure .  I don't have a clue .  I I only know how it works on copper and like ethernet  and on PS PPP over something  and how it works like that ,  but on the wireless I 'm not sure .  Yes , but if if it 's available  that means  so so if uh if it 's already part of the UMTS standardization then uh it 's immediately finished ,  like , OK , you can tell , KPN well go to Ericsson or Nokia and buy it ?  And if it 's not in there yet well , it could be a suggestion  and then the hardware people will make it part u like the ETSI or whatever where U wherever UMTS is standardized they will d well , go for it .  Of course , yeah , this this group could do that , too .  Could be ,  but  I 'm not really sure ,  but I thought I I had the impression that we can throw away our Nokia stuff when our web gateways , when we g even go to GPRS ,  so  let alone UMTS .  That 's the impression I get .  Yeah , definitely .  But but still a le d it 's a it 's a fundamental  uh it 's a part of a of design like the the  the terminal has a WAP stick .  And there 's a box that has also a a WAP stick .  And they do sometime most cases , they do share an IP address .  But doesn't uh have to deal with IP at all .  It 's l just a thirty - bit number  that a actually is an assigned number .  But it 's all only used for identification .  That 's the only thing .  It 's stored in a WAP cookie ,  much like HTP  in a cookie and from the WAP gateway  then it will be HTP real HTP or something .  So it 's it 's really a different uh type of connection .  It looks a little bit like uh the the well , WML looks a little bit like HTML ,  but that 's all what 's uh  It 's not IP at all .  Because there is a gateway , you can access with almost the same microbrowser ,  the same i uh web servers .  If they provide the right content uh , spit out the right uh WML language .  So it 's it 's really a different network technology I think .  Yeah .  But @ @  I i  Well  Ri - right now there is still a lot of WAP , actually .  So that the  Well , users usage .  My colleagues are .  Yeah .  Yeah , they are using WAP .  Yeah .  i  Bu - well , you don't have a mobile phone in in the USA here .  ",,
Bns001.C,"So that 's maybe the reason .  And I 'm not I doubt that it 's not available in Germany .  It 's would be unbelievable to me .  It i it is .  In in in Sweden it is also there .  And in the Netherlands , it is also available .  every provider provides  Oh .  Yeah , but  Oh !  Bu  I 'm the first one to admit that 's a h that it is a hype ,  but and but I 'm I just wanted to say it is being used .  But if it makes sense to me and to especially to have WAP in in between , no .  I 'm not a supporter of it .  So they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ASCII bytes that can rescr refresh the screen with a different animation every , well , second , a few times .  So , that 's that 's true .  I immediately agree .  But the thing was , y you just asked well , "" will will it be the same , will there be WAP for UMTS "" and so on , QPRS .  And well I don't have the answer ,  but I thought it was not .  I 'm just It 's weird it 's weird to stop doing it with GPRS .  Yes .  if you want to do it in a in a mobile phone want to implement it , as a light stack or something .  Yes ?  Sure .  No , not not if you have a big uh web pad or something .  Then you m There there 's an IP stack in it  and  Hmm .  So  c Can I do another one , like  UMTS or wireless u i generally are will be m more expensive .  And especially UMTS .  If they want to get back the money .  So is it maybe a research topic to focus on the  not really billing , of course .  I wouldn't  but at least the different application of protocol - based usage .  So you have uh one connection , one application uses FTP whatever ,  bit voice or some other  That those type of application you m may might want to make more out of a megabit per second or something .  Could that be something ,  or ?  Or is n  No Well , it 's  e  Yeah , that 's true .  Yeah , that 's right .  OK .  Mmm .  N  Well , I 'm not sure .  I I th I think I agree with him .  But uh right now we 're looking at b a th You want to do a big thing instead of a great thing .  So if you d assume that it should connect uh really good to Siemens and to uh KPN , and to the then it starts to get big we should all go to the in the same direction .  If you already assume "" well , OK , they paid money "" , and now you think , OK , what what great thing you want to do , then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to m do .  No .  But you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align KPN with Siemens , for instance .  Uh .  No .  Yeah .  That 's right now the s the status .  Yes .  I 'm out for th one a week and a half .  So on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , I have a workshop at Stanford  and next week I have a week on holiday .  Could be .  Yeah .  So so the only solution would for for KPN would be that there is a p a project in this area .  So that makes sense to do in this ar This , I mean the Bay Area  with a group of uh a few people ,  like four or something ,  and that connects to this project .  So , one somebody or two somebodies can be found uh founded or get money to join this project .  But that the other four should build a service on top of it , that has a clear business focus .  It means eh a a UMTS service basically .  Yeah .  Yeah , but you see the the they ask something pretty strange .  They they want something pretty strange from me that I think of a service ,  a network service .  There are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day  and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start - ups or whatever .  And just think of a service like that , if I could do this .  w  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I you know  Bu  Well , u until now I have been trying to think about it ,  but eh f to me u  what I have every every time I encountered it , it is all this is all pretty close by ,  like the industry is already behind this .  So they they want to make this available pretty soon .  So I 'm just trying to think uh m more ahead , like uh use the wireless device as a only as a signalling thing or something .  So so whenever you come in with your uh GSM phone and there is a PC available , like everything will be directed to the the bigger device or something .  So more services like that .  I think the they are working pretty hard to get IP available very good and efficiently from uh two mobile devices or wireless devices .  a th thing  And there 's a We m  Our group might fo want to focus on the uh IP over ether no nets  or something like  ",,
Bns001.C,"or over ether  N no nets ,  Yeah .  Over  Like only over ether .  carefully integrated for net  but there is no net .  If you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end IP available , that could be a vision .  Like .  Well , so he he says well IP to IP or end to end IP , is far well , it 's far away .  um  So you what you might want to do is well get U M T S out there  and just do uh I Ps playing over radio .  Like like SDH , IP over fiber or WDM - WDM .  This gets rid of the SDH .  Or , well , start with get rid of the ATM first  and then get rid of SDH .  Yeah .  Eh you guys do that discussion later on please ,  uh ?  RSVP .  OK  Don't switch it off .  ",,
Bns001.D,"So  OK .  Thanks Adam .  We could start with our meeting ?  Yep !  OK .  You have to stay all the time here ?  But ch you wanna do ?  Yeah .  OK .  We can do that .  Two nine seven seven ?  Right .  OK .  Yeah .  I will call you then .  Uh , OK .  So , then let 's start with our weekly meeting .  The last time 's uh we learned too much , I believe ,  so  uh , today , I have two topics .  And the first topic , um , we have a new member in our group ,  Miguel Sanchez .  I believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time  and I think he is talking to everybody in the meantime .  So , but , anyway , I would like that Miguel Sanchez will introduce himself a little bit , concerning his background , what he intend to do .  And Because I discussing with him uh , uh many things concerning , uh , his skills and what the NSA group intends to do .  I hope there will be a match , uh , then , for his future work .  And the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail .  I believe we still haven't left our starting position .  And , um , yesterday I also discussed with Wilbert some things  and I would like to focus on the question "" What problem we are going to solve with such a proposal . ""  Not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside ,  but , the technical problem .  But that 's under the s second topic ,  so first I would like that Miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and and uh his background .  So , please .  Mm - hmm .  So , thanks , Miguel .  Yeah , we m discussed it yesterday that you 'll maybe will have a talk next Tuesday  But , Give me a sign and send me an abstract so that I can announce it , then , for the next meeting .  Um .  One short other topic is Uh . Claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime .  And , despite busy stuff with waivers and uh and visas and whatever , uh , she found the time to um write , with what we discussed before and in the form of HTML stuff .  And we wanna put it on the web pages in the next days .  So , I will send an email , then , to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they 're aligned with , um , their own views and opinions of what we should what should be presented on the web pages .  And any feedback is then , well appreciated .  No ?  So .  Let 's switch to the project proposal .  Um , I mentioned that it is still f  Yeah ?  Claudia  Yeah .  Then everybody sees the structure , how it is uh , structured really structured .  Then maybe you wi can easy offer some additional input which should be presented , then , on the web pages .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , it is .  Yeah .  Half collection of necessary information .  Yeah su You can have  Yeah , you can have it .  Because , as uh Uh , uh , le  No ,  but this is oh , uh Everybody 's obliged to do it for his own , you know .  So there is not uh Claudia is not the webmaster here to , uh , get the collection for for for everything .  So .  This is responsible for uh , everybody 's responsible for his own ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK ,  thanks .  So ,  let 's switch to the proposal .  I ask everybody whether read it in the meantime , and understand everything .  Yeah .  Everybody say yes ?  Yeah ?  Yes ,  OK .  Um .  From my point of view , As I mentioned before , we still in the starting position .  I think the four building blocks on the network level will have really a major impact on on f current um , available wireless networks and , uh , also for future generations .  And , what the missing thing is really what kind of problem we are wan wanna s solve with such a project proposal .  And Wilbert yesterday mentioned , and he is right , that , what kind of , maybe , service we are really going to offer .  The linkage between such kind of application , also interactive multimedia application and , uh , this kind of networking stuff is , um , maybe not very well aligned ,  because there will be of course , a portion of mobile access to such kind of application .  But , I think that 's not the majority  and that is not the major focus of um this kind of um this kind of application anyway .  So I would like to to uh split , in principle , the discussions of what kind of application tsk um f far away  and I would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision t concerning these building blocks and the network , Um , What kind of problem we are going to solve .  What kind of , uh , um , um , glue between these four building blocks exists  and what kind of synergy effects , in principle , as if they work and fit very well together exists for networking stuff .  And what kind of service could we provide in that area .  ",,
Bns001.D,"We will have these kind of , uh , really closely working together of these four building blocks .  So maybe uh , Wilbert , you can start to discu oder to to tell the group about what you mentioned yesterday concerning certain kind of ideas .  Maybe it 's a brainstorming um , of of these things  and maybe we can comment later on th these uh these ideas .  And I saw you sk still discuss with with uh Mark , right ?  some stuff .  Was it also related with with these things .  No ?  OK , It was @ @ .  Yeah .  OK  Yeah , yeah .  Then , maybe then , one one w uh sentence before .  I believe everybody fits very well in these kind of things .  Because from the mathematical description with QS - in - Advance , me , as an expert for quality of service and , uh , Michael as an expert for uh , MPLS and Wilbert an expert for for Multicast , and , uh , I discussed with Miguel . It 's uh maybe a little bit the shift to active routing ,  but it is still in the area of routing .  So . My idea is , in principle , to have , independently of any funding , independently of any outer contact , such such a core activity , in principle .  And we can see how much from the outer world can fit in .  First of all , the first stage is the institution which is behind everybody .  That means uh KPN in your case and Siemens in our case .  And maybe , then , in the broader world here other partners registered in the proposal migh  Tomorrow , I will go to Cisco , for instance ,  and I will discuss uh , all this kind of things .  Maybe they have certain additional activities and they 're interested in the results before  The benefit here is , in principle , that the results are available .  They are not restricted any way .  If you have your own common activity . That makes a little bit more easier .  And , uh , if there is a technical linkage between such , uh um , between the outer world and us OK , the better it is .  But , anyway , if we come to a certain kind of uh , common work within the core of the NSA group , I think that 's really beneficial to everybody .  And uh , especially , Wilbert , if you have in mind to go in the mmm , uh , really from the project proposal view , I think we can build it on this this core .  You know ,  and go to the outer world with , and and and align it in a certain way .  For instance , that it also fit , maybe , to KPN , and Siemens , and in other companies .  Yeah .  Yep .  Hmm .  Uh , maybe I will write a few keywords on the on the whiteboard  OK .  Yet the basic idea is , in principle , to switch seamlessly between wireless LAN technology , whatever and UMTS ,  right ?  And you see the benefit that , in principle , the customer will save a lot of money .  Because if in - house communication like WaveLAN or maybe I see it also in the American market , some WaveLAN communication in the outer world will be available , the m and that is your assumption , that the more cost uh extensive um U M T S connection could be principle used , I would like to say , over WaveLAN ,  and then I have a normal WaveLAN connection , right ?  And the router and the WaveLAN connection goes into the core internet elsewhere  and the connection is not dropped between this seamless hand off I would like to say .  Right ?  or what or  What  Yeah , but if this is the final goal ,  it should be as much as possible available that you do not have to break the connection if you switch between the subnets ' technology  Right ?  Yeah ,  non - null  Yeah , but if your s  uh I believe everybody is aware about the USAIA architecture .  And uh this one is , here , this stuff is , here , also related to this kind what is mentioned there concerning the end system .  And in my conf uh considered end system , there is a certain kind of policy , concerning how to use subnets technologies and and all these kind of things .  How to use quality of service , you know , in advance ,  because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services .  And that should not be done automatically .  But it could be done automatically .  But nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible , that you could set up a certain kind of mini - database how to deal with all these kind of things .  I think that 's not a problem .  But uh what I I would like to ask Wilbert here , and we discuss it yesterday , "" Is it only the usage of that PCMCIA card where you have instead of GSM today , UMTS , and instead of wireless LAN today also wireless LAN .  Remember your four and one card uh concerning um ,  what is the name , from Dataco - ?  No .  Dacom  Where you can enable four technologies , and you plug in , in your laptop  and then you have every four uh subnet layer technologies available in your laptop .  Is that the problem ?  Yeah , that 's not the problem .  Right .  Why ?  Yeah , but this i  ",,
Bns001.D,"Yeah , but this is th only the probing to figure out that you get at a certain location the information that a s certain coverage of a certain subnet techn technology is available .  And if so , then what Miguel mentions , then you add a certain kind of policy , to switch or not to switch , to this kind of technology ,  right ?  But this is end - system related .  That 's not network related .  I see no network related stuff within these in this uh idea .  It 's only to set up i u  For me it 's like a laptop t to plug one PCMCIA and currently will have two PCMCIA cards , and I compare GSM with UMTS .  And today I would like to have GSM ,  and then I have my GSM connectivity .  And I cannot use it other technology ,  only GSM , because the interfaces , the driver interface , does not permit me to switch between the between different technologies .  So if I want to go to wireless LAN I have to stop my connection and put in my wireless LAN PCMCIA card ,  and then I can go on and set up the the same connection one more time .  And what you have in mind , to do it a bit more seamlessly , and that makes an only sense for me if both technologies , in principle , were close together in that sense for application .  For instance , the application would be that I have my laptop here ,  and I work here with wi with my device ,  any kind of device ,  and I work here in wireless LAN area .  And then I go outside , and want to go still on , leaving the coverage of uh of the uh wireless LAN .  And at a certain state , the device uh receives certain signals that the coverage of UMTS or GSM is available .  And at that state , you automatically , or based on the certain kind of user profile , switched to the um UMTS or GSM st uh network .  That 's the only senseful application .  From my understanding , that means only to have a certain kind of control layer for the different drivers ,  which you also mentioned as a USAIA architecture .  and uh then to do the switching for an existing stream or application between these uh , transparently to this application , between those uh these both technologies .  Maybe there 's more potential .  I don't s see it ,  but maybe you have a additional idea .  And I don't think that this end system device uh architecture , which will come automatically .  And I believe there 's a lot of activity throughout the world ,  because this seamlessly communication is always mentioned elsewhere where you cou where you listen to .  So  uh uh  Now , I would like not to hear only three opinions .  But maybe there are also other opinions .  And maybe everybody should uh give a short  Let us understand , built for everybody and their com whether their comments .  Oh , please come in .  Uh .  OK  Good luck .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And the building blocks ,  yeah .  Multicast , not a topic .  Routing ?  Well , what you the pointer the pointer you sent yesterday .  Yeah ,  I c I didn't find the time , yeah , to do so ,  but ,  uh  A Ricochet here , right ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Ah we just discussed a lot about proxies .  That 's a fun  Mm - hmm .  Uh maybe a few comments .  First of all , Um . Do you mind Mi - Miguel , to write the name of the project on the whiteboard ?  So that everybody  Uh I I will send also the pointer which Miguel sent to me , to everybody so that everybody can take a look to this uh , project .  And uh I don't know what avail information is available  because I didn't find the time currently to check it out .  But first of  Yeah .  Uh , sorry ?  Uh do  Mm - hmm .  Ah !  Ah !  OK ,  I see .  Yeah ? @ @  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Then the second thing is that uh Daimler - Chrysler research here in Palo Alto as well as in Germany , Ulm , is doing , in principle , the same with a car .  They have a specific antenna for uh GSM Oh , GPS and and fu for future extended G - uh GSM networks and wireless LAN and and other thi and other network technology .  In the roof of the car . They have a s lot of servers  in the trunk of the car . Then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things  and they are driving around the different areas .  And the same car exists here in Palo Alto uh based on wireless LAN , GSM and 2 x Ricochet networks .  They collect the dat collect collecting a lot of data . concerning the seamless handoffs and whether it works very well with speed  and um  uh , Thomas is going to build mobile IP stuff in their servers .  uh  because they want to  use current technology with a c a combination of mobile IP . So I think there is a lot of activities in the area .  Uh .  And my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here .  But , anyway , maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind .  I see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of UMTS know how .  ",,
Bns001.D,"And you need it definitely  because then it j must be your uh Bible I would like to say that you are very familiar with UMTS if you wanna go in in that way .  And As far as I know the UMTS standardization is not finished yet .  Ninety percent , maybe , or eighty percent .  I kno I 'm not sure .  But uh  that  Yeah .  Users of of UMTS ?  You can request certain kind of QS .  You can even request it in GPS  but it 's not end - to - end quality of service .  It is only um what the gateways get .  And within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up in the core network itself of the access provider ,  not the internet backbone core .  And you use certain kind of tunnel mechanism to combine , in principle , the base station cluster control .  But this is uh is controlled by a certain kind of node .  And you have the gateway to the PDN , or the Public Data Network .  And between both there 's a certain kind of tunnel set up .  You mean now for GSM , @ @ ,  or ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , what is what means quality of service .  A certain degree .  Right ?  Uh .  Sometimes we have some  It 's packaged data oriented .  It 's not really circuit - switched .  In UMTS you have always GPS as a a involvement in the core network .  You have , in principle , the path which still is available for for the GSM network .  Also they use , in principle , the same uh the same mechanism .  But you also have a dat uh packet oriented communication that 's on the GPS stuff .  And that 's also related to UMTS .  So ,  that is  No , I think there 's a lot  Yeah .  I think there 's a lot of research .  But the question is "" is this uh a research wh in which direction we are going ? ""  And because  For inf  Right ,  but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different .  The picture I have in mind concerning UMTS is , first of all , if you use UMTS only for voice , Like you did it or are doing now for GSM , it 's not worth to have this kind of network .  And , currently in Europe , where it will be deployed first , I believe , it will be very hard , in principle , to get some money back if you have only for using it for voice .  Because they paid a lot of money .  So .  What is the point ?  The point is that you use the UMTS to connect to the internet and have certain kind of services which are still not available up to now .  But the problem is if you have the internet content , and you have maybe your small uh um device of maybe only evolution based for for these uh new technologies , for for certain mobile phones , then you have certain kind of problems ,  you know ,  because you cannot use these things .  And WAP is not an answer for for these kind of things ,  you know .  So .  The I believe there is a lot of research work  and also if you see the end - to - end scope of the internet , from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server , "" correspondent node "" , or whatever you call this destination , then you have certain kind of models , for instance , for the quality of service and all these kind of things .  And then is UMTS only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology .  And you have to match these things anyway .  It 's like a normal ethernet .  Whatever you see , it is only an additional subnet layer technology .  And you have all the things mapped to the uh to to the to the the internet stuff , in principle , to this technology .  And furthermore , you see that the trend is to put more IP technology , really , really IP technology , and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations , to their access network itself .  And  th there 's a lot of potential , as I believe , for for uh certain research work .  But the question is , first of all , "" Do we have the competence to do something like that ? ""  First of all .  Second , we are not hardware builders , in that sense to set up certain kind of end systems .  We can design them , yeah , from the protocol layering  and and maybe have some simulations , or whatever .  But isn't the final outcome really such a device ?  Prototype , Linux based .  And we go around here and we have maybe a GPS - base station sponsored by Ericsson ,  since they are living not so far away  and and maybe WaveLAN connection , here  now a testbed  and then then figure out that it works ?  So , that 's my point .  Yep .  But it 's really higher level .  Right ?  It 's no more related to a network .  We are leaving the network area .  That 's dangerous .  Cuz if you go to the app  If you  For me that 's starting with middleware aspects ,  you know ?  And  No , I believe "" network "" is , if you see it really from from the IP protocol suite , is then layer one , in principle , up t including layer four ,  ",,
Bns001.D,"despite the fact that layer four is only residing , normally , in the end system and in the gateways .  Yeah .  Yeah , we have , I think , some .  Yeah .  Do you see this word "" application "" related to a network ?  Or do you see this word independently ?  That was never discussed in detail .  "" Network Services and Applications "" .  So , everything in the world .  Or is the application related to the network ?  For my understanding and as far as we discussed , so such a long time uh , these applications should  For instance , e - commerce .  And it 's really , really  yeah  You know ?  That  Yeah .  No no , uh that is a typical application , I think ,  which is , in principle , also a little bit related to uh to the network .  But not any application .  And we also have the aspects for security .  Miguel , you mentioned here authentication and and triple - A ,  but we do not have any expert anymore .  Because Hannes was an expert for that .  So the problem for me , it still exists that we have , in principle , here basic building blocks in the proposal from the networking side .  We could have a certain kind of application  and there 's a lot of activities in the outside world  and I believe there 's a lot of contacts .  Or there could be a lot of contacts uh with with these people .  Especially at uh Georgia Tech .  I know on next week on Tuesday .  Tuesday , right ?  We will go to UCB .  There are three guys .  Then Morgan mentioned one .  I do not know exactly um uh what he is doing ,  but , he 's also interesting in some kind of collaboration .  He 's also a professor in the UCB .  And uh many universities  maybe Claudia mentioned Duisburg .  And uh in principle , most of the university have some activities in that area .  We will not take care about these one ,  but we can use them as um for field ex uh field trial access  and and and maybe some support  and and whatever kind of thing .  And we focus really on the networking stuff  and going in more detail in this area .  And the alternative is maybe what uh  currently we have only uh this uh proposal from Wilbert to go more in the smaller scope .  Figure out some potential from maybe this uh WaveLAN UMTS stuff  and and starting from that .  Or , are there other suggestions ?  Yeah , you know , it 's still mentioned in the proposal .  And  th um  I I 'm sure , OK , that it is the wrong place to get the foundation why we are use this kind of application ,  but uh And In in the end of the text in the end of the pr text of the proposal .  But it is mentioned that it is only an example .  And that we use this application , in principle , while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access to these kind of things .  When you have a video game server and and you want to have mobile access you must at least have one in your consortium , or as a partner whatever , who provides this service .  And then we we are playing videos , in principle , if you have a field trial .  And that is , I think , much more harder than to have a certain kind of certain kind of access to the University ,  and uh to this server , which is run on the campus of the University .  And that is the point .  You can have this f to figure out all the things  and the the um  and the the um  um , now , how to say , the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario .  But nevertheless , it 's not the best for  and and and and uh  s networking stuff .  You are right .  But it Does anybody see certain kind of potential here to go on ,  and to start the work maybe in this little bit smaller oh uh scope based on these building blocks ?  Because Multicast you still mentio uh you mentioned that there is no potential .  I think it 's described here that the potential , if you use it for the mapping to the next generation networks in the wireless access area they are still some potential to map Multicast  because they do not use it .  And to figure out whether they 're useful inse instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism and to set up these tunnels  and have the mapping between a PSDN uh telephone number or whatever kind of number they are using to IP addresses and then there 's the tunnel I Ds ,  and and all this kind of things , I think , is very beneficial as well for for telecommunication providers .  as well as for ISP 's .  I I think the potential is still there .  You you neglected that ,  but I don't think that you are right in that sense .  In next generation ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Now what do you see about the  um , um ,  KPN interests ?  ",,
Bns001.D,"Because , I believe s if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the Multicast stuff , and KPN is very interesting in UMTS stuff , and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on , but only for the uh IP - layer technology , then , why do the mapping of multica also potential mapping of Multicast , I think , must be of major interest for them .  Right ?  Mm - hmm .  Now , WAP is ja not only related now to available bandwidth .  That 's not the only thing .  It 's only the adaptation towards the capabilities of the end device .  Right ?  So .  uh I never was a friend  Huh .  Yeah .  So yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  It 's transparent , in principle , what you can carry ,  but  Anyway , you have the gateway .  It must be uh The ca uh c uh t conversion of the media  of the contents , in principle .  But , I don't see that uh  It 's too late , I believe .  If WAP was available in the beginning of GSM , then I think it was there would be a good chance that it is well - deployed .  But now , the first generation of web - browsers are in the ha and and uh I would say "" handies "" ,  so that 's wrong in the mobile phones ,  but the the next generation of networks are still available .  and the ba uh the bandwidth constraints are no more applicable ?  And  Yeah , but The hype  but  pffft  uh  I never saw a user using WAP .  Please raise your hand , who is using WAP .  Yeah ?  Yeah ?  OK , one of six .  So .  Oh .  Now , do you yeah , do you see the chance for WAP ?  I don't see it .  Yeah .  There 's a gate You can put the gateway  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So maybe I would like to ask Claudia ,  you read the proposal in the meantime ?  Yeah .  Yes , that 's right .  And do you have some comments on it  from the next this is version zero dot five right , yeah .  That 's right .  Yeah .  OK .  Also we want to go more in the triple - A area . Right ?  Because billing alone  Or or ac um Billing is related to accounting ,  Accounting is related to Authentification and Authorization .  So .  And then you are still at the triple - A service uh activity  and nobody is has the skills to deal with that .  And then we are leaving our scope anyway .  Yeah . That 's  That is a  As it What I mean , the synergy effect , right ?  From from  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . I  Yeah , in principle , it is related to the current state .  But the networking stuff is more explained in much more detail  and the work packages are better ident oder what c could be derived for work packages is much better aligned .  But that has not changed , yeah ?  Yeah , the problem is if you  Yeah OK maybe one sentence one sentence .  If you 're focussing on the argument chain as follows . I have an application .  This application has certain kind of requirements .  These requirements are , maybe , Multicast and and and quality of service and mobility  access and then mobility management  and That is it .  I want to focus on it .  Then you have in mind that Or you must have in mind that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this .  That you can use it with every application  and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network , that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom , it must be fit end to end .  And if you assume something , like we discussed it , very hard with with Multicast , that you assume that Multicast will be available at certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end , this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet .  Otherwise it makes no sense ,  and we come to the conclusion , "" OK , uh Multicast , we must deal with both approaches "" ,  that you have eh application layer Multicast  as well as maybe some other Multicast and maybe really Multicast  and then the point is how to select these mechanism if you want to have not a certain kind of access to the server elsewhere in the network you want to use any application .  Yeah ,  and  The application , for instance , here , that eh the interactive classroom .  But elsewhere any application in in in any kind of video audio  or whatever kind of game server  what - whatever kind of interactive multimedia especially do uh downstreaming applications maybe eh video on demand then , eh whatever kind of application you can consider .  Not on everything .  That 's not true .  But we s  That 's why we say here , that we have a certain kind of eh possibility to change in the access networks .  That means the wireless networks  because that provides , in principle , the mobility .  And these mechan  And you see that there 's a trend to provide IP functionality more and more in these kind of networks .  But the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um technology only for the access network .  You have to have in mind always the end to end scope .  ",,
Bns001.D,"And if you see , for instance We have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things , u  especially also for Multicast ,  different things really for different providers ,  and uh and it 's uh very easy to change it , maybe in the access network , for novel things .  For instance , that 's one provider domain  and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain ?  So it means that packet are delivering information ,  and you do not have the separation of routing and and and forwarding process .  It 's impossible to deal with that in the whole internet ,  because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible .  So how to combine these pos uh potential um extensions in the um access networks , and  without losing the end to end scope in the internet .  Then you can have certain n novel features  give the providers like KPN or whatever , the po the potential , in principle , to to uh see the building blocks for the future networks  because there 's a three g third generation like UMTS , a fourth generation more IP related .  There will be a fifth generation , I 'm sure .  And then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network ,  if you ever really full I uh uh full I P , end to end .  But nevertheless you can only not only focus on "" OK , I provide this mechanism ""  because u you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet , using any application .  And then this mechanism must fit it there .  But nevertheless eh internet backbone is in the meantime , based on its success ,  impossible to change .  You see the difficulties with IP version six ,  eh eh you see the difficulties with Multicast .  They are discussed since , you know , ten years or whatever .  The specification are rather stable and and available  but we have only islands in that .  We cannot assume that everything is end to end available .  And so you have to mi to have to have in mind that certain kinds of mechanisms are maybe at a certain stage end to end available ,  maybe we have a lucky that the islands are connected to each other  or the same applies for MPLS , for instance ,  maybe they are only portions available ,  how to deal with that when the islands are not available  and maybe nothing is available .  But you have to select it  because I have a mobile phone , a mobile node or whatever kind of device ,  and I want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet .  So is it possible to d have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with .  I always say that the success of internet make it unflexible .  It 's impossible to change something very easy . s  s  It 's easy maybe more on the access network as in the internet backbone .  So that is eh overall picture that we have in mind with these things .  And we can not u  We we are six people  or seven or whatever  if Hannes come ,  We are not able to solve the problems uh in in uh w in the few years or whatever  what the whole internet community has um done in in si since uh since a decade .  But we can f pick up some f some um potential and and and to start with something .  And that 's my missing point .  That we have here , in principle , really the description of this problem I mentioned  and focus really on the reasonable size of the project  maybe in the first stage fo for the NSA core itself ,  and maybe possible extension from , for instance , if KPN say "" yes , that 's great , ""  "" that 's the right direction .  We will support that . ""  And if Siemens say "" OK , great , we will support it "" ,  and and what it  mmm University of Berlin or something  and maybe University of Mannheim or Duisburg  or in Spain oder whatever .  So if we have all the similar project then you have only to take care about that 's a little bit aligned ,  that there 's some transparency concerning the results  and and the activities are literally going in the in the same um pace .  So that 's the basic idea .  But really it 's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it .  That 's the point .  And if we get some funding back ,  and we have certain potent uh potential partners in the boat ,  OK , we can go to a broader scope of this whole thing , yeah .  Yeah , but the problem is that f f f funding is the second step .  Yeah .  Yeah , but we have no eh current no public funding ,  OK , everybody 's paid here .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  That 's right .  That 's right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Now , that 's the point why I am focussing on more on the  Yeah .  I want to have really the activities  you know , what is really the outcome  what is really the problem we are going to solve .  These are my questions .  And if we have identified this block then it is possible to raise some money .  Yeah .  It 's clear .  ",,
Bns001.D,"Now from my point of view in the beginning , one more time , if I see the four building blocks , and eh I could speak only for my skills , I believe to derive a certain kind of QS Reservation - in - Advance scheme Much more uh general as it is done for for USAIA ,  but mapped then really to desired network subnet layer technologies .  Yes .  For  No , for y UMTS .  But first of all , a generic system ,  but because you can have several mechanism  really using certain kind of of um um quantitative description ,  you can have more of a qualitative description ,  you can have taken into account moving patterns ,  and and and whatever kind of things ,  but there are a lot of lot of ways to have certain kind of QS Reservation - in - Advance ,  and I see it as definitely is necessary to have this one  if I want be mobile and I want to have not a interruption of my in my application qualities of service .  So .  Um  But then , to go , for instance , to UMTS , and figure out what is available within UMTS .  And if I really have an IP application , where I need this kind of of quality of service and having in mind that certain kind of QS will be available in the rest of the internet .  So how can I map these things uh to the UMTS stuff ?  And what is the trend towards UMTS to the first generation ?  And how it is possible to map this one to this technology ?  And if you have the building blocks identified , what is really necessary for QS eh QS - in - Advance for for mobile systems , then you have , in principle , the ideas for the following generation what you could improve .  Because then you are maybe no more related to this kind of thing .  I believe the same applies for Multicast .  And I believe the same applies for routing .  So , in principle , in the beginning , there would be a certain kind of uh paperwork anyway ,  some theoretical examination of these problems ,  and then some prototypes must be derived from that .  And then maybe we will start here with a certain kind of uh testbed equipment we still have here .  We have four uh P Cs available .  Maybe we have to extend it then ,  and figure out some real scenarios ,  and maybe then pfff !  Because uh , despite the fa  uh uh Hopefully , then we have with the money also not eh only for the room ,  that would be great ,  but there are also some sponsors then then then we add a certain kind of field trial .  But I think that 's pfff ! that 's years , you know .  That 's years .  But in the beginning we must have a certain kind of theoretical framework with the relevant technology .  Real technology .  Maybe you can start with GPS or or UMTS , or whatever .  because these technology will definitely available in Europe .  There 's some money spent on it ,  so that it will be in a certain kind of flavor .  It will be available .  And it will be also available in the USA .  Because there is a big eh harmonization effort ,  despite the fact they are not aligned to each other anyway ,  but they will have s also certain kind of thr third generation and fourth generation networks .  So .  And after this theoretical framework , if this one is aligned , OK you have some specification  and you set up some Linux or Free BSD or whatever kind of prototype .  So that is what I have in mind with that .  And then OK , and then you will see .  The problem is which I see is that it could be fruitful to standardization  that it could be fruitful to some extent to telecommunication providers .  But there 's not a real product like you say .  There 's not the selling idea behind it .  Yeah ,  if you go with something what what Wilbert mentioned "" OK , let 's have this one here "" . We have a new PCMCIA card and and extend something and the end system , or what you mentioned here was the seamless four technologies inter - working in the end s , then you have an an a device which you can sell .  If you go for a networking pfff um uh improvements , in principle , and and understanding next generation building blocks , uh there 's no product .  But it is a long term it 's long term , I think , uh work you can do .  And it 's more related I believe to the skills  to what is available  and and currently as I see what uh will be available within the NSA group .  And uh , the point is if we focus on on this networking small more networking stuff and em some application guys came into the boat and they focus on their application stuff , whatever this means , It might be we have then the active classroom ,  but it could be another one  that is not representative ,  it 's only  Hmm ?  Yeah .  Then then is something available  but I don't know  you know , I 'm not an application expert ,  I  We have some content .  We will then discuss it on next Tuesday as I mentioned .  Uh Anyway , but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available .  The good thing is that the money is available ,  because everybody is paid here .  ",,
Bns001.D,"So that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available .  But first of all Wilbert need more , definitely ,  because maybe then KPN is uh no more interesting to go on with this work ,  or we can convince with these kind of things which we have in mind ,  uh companies like KPN .  So  And if we have other suggestions and eh have this as a long term  NSA core group activity ,  and this theoretical framework , whether it is finished in half a year or one year doesn't matter , in principle ,  because the road map for the the next generation networks is is eh is for many years .  And b before UMTS will be deployed very well , I believe eh it will be common t uh two thousand four or something like that .  So .  And and have an intermediate project , which is related in this direction , something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever .  This is a smaller portion in the gen more generic framework , I would like to say , from this proposal .  Why not go in this way ?  I I don't know .  But uh that 's the point eh we are sitting here together .  But for for Dietmar I think eh eh he mentioned it to me , it 's very clear that he will go on with a portion of time , with this USAIA stuff ,  in the matical sense  because that means for you in a certain kind a certain extent , you are decoupled from networking stuff .  Because your focusing on the mathematical thing of whether it 's a network or other thing ,  it doesn't matter  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So .  There is it still ongoing activity with uh maybe a portion of time at the University of Berlin Berlin .  And independently whether I will leave the uh uh ICSI in in the mid of December or not , I will still focus on on on these QS - in - Advance schemes  eh also within Siemens  and also with some project there .  And I believe your routing stuff is also available ,  uh ,  And when you when you will go back to Spain , right ?  Yeah , so . and and that 's why , in principle , the skills will be always available I guess .  if there is a certain type of project in the home countries and then the eh institutions and  yeah  maybe  Currently no money is available , you know .  Now , I will not prevent anybody from getting some cake  and we are sitting here together  it 's uh very uh very slow , in principle ,  but my last question is for Wilbert .  Wilbert , you I I think you got the basic idea  because it was mostly discussed with you here from this current available scrap project proposal .  Don't you think that KPN could be convinced to go on this way what I mentioned before ?  There 's no way ?  They needed definitely , in principle , some kind of service or device or product or whatever .  Can we both have together , maybe , I think it 's a little bit more easier , a discussion on Thursday ?  OK .  OK .  Maybe that 's enough time for you to consider a little bit more in this direction ?  And then we could have eh discussion  and maybe this one is an overall work , in principle , where everybody could hook in and and get certain kind of small portions to solve it  and  mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Can you consider poten also in the meantime , some potential UMTS services besides this one ?  And  No , but , uh fff maybe based on this one and you see the networking stuff  that it is a little bit more evol evolved and than in the the core network technology in the access network , I would like to say .  And this is aligned then as much as possible to the internet .  That 's the basic idea ,  that you can have a certain kind of service which make use of these novel things .  Because normally I I believe the the the people are either on the application layer ,  that means higher than layer four ,  or they are on layer f one to l l up to layer four .  And the service people are considering  "" OK , UMTS  you have some location information ,  and maybe you are have the infrastructure in the car ,  so , if I provide a certain kind of service , independently what the network is offering , you know .  Because they do not consider it very well .  They know there is a certain kind of location information  and you have a GPS ,  and they know , OK , it 's based on satellite .  And there 's UMTS , that is based on base station .  There 's all that they consider .  And then assume , OK , I can do that .  And the networking guy said OK it would be great to have Multicast and all these kind of things in the network ,  but do not consider really what a sense of benefit uh for applications ,  there were new app old application make use of it  and how can new application arise  which we haven't considered up to now based on this new network function , LAT enrich enriched network function , LAT .  So , I think it 's worth to to consider something in that way  Yeah , what is our  Not currently there is a techno technology split .  Of course you have IP in the mobile device  but if you see the strange protocols text  ",,
Bns001.D,"there 's IP over IP and tunnels and and whatever ,  so , but it 's uh looks very strange to me  because you have different numbering screens , concerning you have a phone number ,  you have to map it to IP addresses  and and so on ,  but for me , you have not the end to end parts of for for IP functionality .  We are far away from that .  And if you take a really look to the GPRS protocols texts and I believe also they apply for UMTS but I 'm not  eh very familiar with that ,  and the next generations access network is will come soon .  You see it 's every three years or four years they will have a new generation .  But anyway you  yeah ?  yeah ?  Why ?  What kind what kind IP over what do you call it ?  No net .  That would be great !  Can you repeat it ?  Mm - hmm .  Something like that is my final vision .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  ATM stuff .  Yeah .  Yeah .  There 's the problem is is , you see that the providers eh have always there broken view for for the management .  If you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system , and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff , in principle , but you still need it , is eh not aligned .  We have it for different islands  and and  Well , that 's my final vision you know .  If you have really then IP networks at a certain generation where you have really the physical media and where necessary uh additional maclear protocols ,  and then you have really always end to end .  It makes you things much more simple much more easier ,  uh , but is far far away , you know .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah but you have the extension for the eh quality of service mechanism  which you have to map then to the underlying technology .  And  Yeah but maybe in the LAN interface it makes  since to use it  And and But  yeah  but I think we sh we will miss the cake  and I think we should stop now but please everybody ,  short  eh s  go on with considerations and potential  and and uh  um we didn't make s much progress today in the meeting ,  but anyway this kind of activity lives from all , from the input of all .  And so I really  if somebody has an idea send an email  and then I would like to enforce everybody  not that I 'm doing everything  I could not I f didn't have the time in the past  and I will not have it in the future  and maybe I will stay here only s four weeks or five weeks .  So it would be really not the best thing if the activity is dead when I am leaving  and if I stay longer of course we can go on  but nevertheless I rely heavily uh also from the contributions of everybody ,  and it 's in their own interest  of of everybody , also from the institution behind . So If there is certain kind of idea or questions or whatever , we are s only a small group of people  we can easily join on a white board and and start a discussion .  It must not be on every Tuesday , you know ,  at a certain time .  And I try to motivate the people .  That it 's free .  That 's a starting .  That 's a ramp .  And we can go in different directions .  And if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or UMTS or whatever , great .  If not , the long term and then these things must be , nevertheless must be defined in much more detail .  Yeah .  OK ?  So , thanks  please do not , um what Adam mentioned to  uh switch off ,  So maybe I will find him @ @ .  cake area .  and  now let me see whether he will be here ,  and  We did not forget .  We are done .  OK OK .  Hopefully everything went fine .  ",,
Bns001.E,"But there 's no personal homepage for everybody ?  Or , is it planned or not ,  or ?  I 'm not interested in this .  That makes work .  Yeah .  OK .  Sure .  OK ,  his name and so on .  Yeah .  OK  Mm - hmm .  Yes .  It 's a project of the UC .  Oh , yeah .  You think more about hardware technology .  So , there is a lot of hardware to develop , but not  I think we uh have already so much work put into this proposal ,  why to switch now ?  So I don't see the reason for that .  Maybe the application we suggested is not the best one .  So we have to think about an application which which is um um , for mobile users , more relevant .  I don't know .  Maybe video games .  If you are traveling  uh , it 's boring to travel  and then you decide to play a g video game with somebody else who 's traveling .  So .  OK , that 's right .  I don't have a mobile phone .  That 's right .  It depends on my  Well , I 'm foc  I 'm focused on performance evaluation  and um especially of communication networks  and  I never eh e um dealed with um mobile communications .  So why not ?  So that 's eh , to open my mind .  Not to switch off .  ",,
Bns001.F,"OK ,  so we should be on .  And I 'm gonna go ahead and start by reading the digit strings ,  just to give you an example of how to do it .  And so the first thing to do is read the transcript number  which is on the right hand side there .  And so if you could just go around the table  and read them out .  Yep  If you could sign that ?  Thanks .  Thanks  So , I wanted to just era it reiterate cuz we did have have one person come in a little later that , um there will be an opportunity to remove anything from the transcript that you don't want made public after it 's transcribed ,  so that 'll be some months off ,  but you will have that opportunity  OK ?  Thanks .  Yep !  Thanks very much .  I don't have to  Um .  Well  It 's just At the end of the meeting , don't turn off the mikes  just leave them on .  And uh  Uh .  Actually could y actually , could you call me , At the end of the meeting ?  I 'll leave my number on the board there  Thanks .  Numbers are strange !  It is !  the the meetings are strange .  People interrupt each other much more than I thought they did .  two nine seven seven .  Thanks .  Yeah , just leave them on for now .  Sometimes if you turn it off while it 's recording it crashes  ",,
Bns001.G,"OK ,  should I next ?  Hey , Adam , you know what ?  It must be funny to do an a research on how people behave while reading these numbers .  That must be  Yeah !  It must be much more interesting to to see their behavior .  Oh y yeah !  Oh ,  OK .  Ah .  Sorry .  Can I ?  Maybe I can add something .  Yeah , if there 's anything else which we what we could add on the web site .  So , p For example , if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever , about the work you did before , what you are planning to do here , that would be fine ,  cuz now we can add some more stuff there .  Or if you have something or if somebody has some slides , o or articles , whatever he wants to be published there .  Yeah  and  Yeah , it depends what what everybody wants to do .  So  about the projects will be something ,  then , about publications will be another point ,  and Yeah , additional information about how is life in Berkeley and i Yep . I don't know , some some hints , some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that .  Oh , oh , no , I 'm not doing it for everybody  but what I can  Yeah , but but what is planned is that I do something like a previous , you know , layout , and give everybody the , uh , opin uh , the possibility to the chance to put his content inside  so that the layout is for everybody the same ,  so about the projects and stuff .  So , there will be something .  Hmm ?  Oh !  OK .  Yeah , but the task changed really a lot ,  so , I 'd I rather would like to  Yeah , but I 'd rather like to follow the discussion before I gave any comments ,  cuz it 's really The first point is it 's much more than it was before I left ,  so it 's like five weeks in between , so it 's like that whew !  that big now .  And it really changed a lot  cuz the I mean I found the classroom inside  but , the thing where I left the discussion was that we are talking about uh a classroom where you know everybody could look on with any kind of device and follow lectures or do exercise or whatever .  So .  Now we are talking about something which is much more precise  and the the range of stuff is maybe more narrow than before  so I 'd rather like to to follow it a bit , and then to get more into the ideas .  What do you mean by "" put together "" ?  Ah .  Mm - hmm .  So why I wasn't ,  well , yeah , uh hold myself back a bit with comments , is uh cuz when I left the discussion , the discussion was what to to have something like a big umbrella about everybody who was at this point , here .  And so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now .  And there I had the impression the umbrella was this kind of classroom thing .  Right ?  Or wrong ?  Yeah , yeah , yeah . It is .  Of course .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  That 's that 's clear .  But  Yeah , that 's that 's clear ,  but then I don't get  because when we were discussion discussing this uh stuff weeks ago , uh I had the impression that , you know , everything of these work packages uh fit together under this one big umbrella .  And now it sounds different .  So that 's what I don't understand .  Ah but , it 's also because I missed the last four weeks .  So .  It 's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks ,  why it changed so .  So if I understandi it right , what has changed is before we were focussing on  So Cuz what 's difficult for me is what is meant by "" application "" ?  So . Cuz I have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining "" application "" in different way .  So , what exactly is mean by "" application "" ?  Yeah .  Oh , OK .  So , what has changed  So what has changed is that we 're not only focussing on this intelligent classroom , but on everything .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah but there 's something needed to sell it .  And I think  Bless you .  Do not Don't switch it off .  ",,
Bns002.A,"Worse than no work .  No .  One  It It is actually  No problem .  Um , just log out .  Uh . No .  Log out .  OK .  That 's the proper answer .  Yeah .  Paez .  Paez .  ",,
Bns002.B,"OK .  Um , is that really an ad - hoc network ?  Because the sensors are not moving .  And I think it 's makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are .  So .  Yeah .  That 's it .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm ,  OK .  Yeah ,  I see .  Mm - hmm .  Um , a further question .  Um .  Am I right that this um dialogue does not prevent um any disturbance of other nodes in the um sending range of , yeah , N - one .  S  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  That 's it .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But then this node , um , this transmission is uh aborted .  And so there 's no advantage to uh if it 's aborted , by by any data packets .  So this um node has to stop each transmission .  So , even the at - the - moment - ongoing transmission .  Is that right ?  So , his transmission is aborted .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  That 's right .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  but this scenario is also nov uh , only working if um both or all nodes have the same range of transmission .  So , the s same radius of the sending range .  So otherwise um this one node maybe um would hear his neighbor but not vice versa .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But I 'm thinking about this example you gave before .  Yeah .  But one of the  But one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one .  So  OK .  So that was my question .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But  Mm - hmm .  OK .  It 's a assumption it 's it 's clear .  But on the other hand , um , in a real world it isn't , or ?  Um .  In real scenarios , uh , you have to  Yeah ,  eh that 's it .  A car or  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  OK .  That  You 're not assuming this .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah , a cellular phone and a car .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So there are  OK .  So there 's more than one IP address in the header ,  and  OK , I see .  Do they have to  Do they have to be in order ?  So you are looking first for node two and then for node three and so on .  OK .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  You mentioned um six partners of this um work .  So you know already what partners are included .  OK I didn't have a look at uh slides ,  OK .  Just I 'm just curious .  Yeah , sure .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah yeah .  And all of them had agreed ,  or ?  OK .  ",,
Bns002.C,"OK .  We can start ?  OK .  So , welcome to our next meeting .  Uh , today we will have a talk from Miguel Sanchez concerning his uh work related to ad - hoc networks .  We have here a guest , a former ICSI member of the NSA group , Jordi Domingo Pasqual .  He is , uh , assistant professor at UPC .  And maybe Jordi , you have a few words concerning your work  one or two sentence  and because we will have tomorrow a talk from him in more detail concerning what 's going on .  Yeah , only a short introduction ,  ve very short introduction , please .  Uh , sorry , one interruption .  This is not related to hearing ,  it 's only for fixing it .  It 's not a earphone .  No .  So .  Yeah , yeah .  Like this one .  Yeah .  It 's only a microphone .  Yeah ?  OK .  Yeah .  OK .  OK .  Thank you .  And after the talk of uh , Miguel , I will give you all a few slides concerning the project proposal .  I will um say something about in which direction it will go  and  uh  Maybe it was my fault that I assumed that the pointer of Miguel concerning UMTS services was deployed to everybody ,  but it was only sent to me ,  so in the meantime everybody got , I believe , this pointer from me ,  and  maybe we It 's a homework , in principle , for the next meeting , to get a little bit familiar with these things .  And um  so I believe we will not have today a very hard technical discussion ,  maybe more a few topic and items we will focus in the next days , until the next meeting .  And when we are ready with our meeting .  Everything is done .  Then , uh , we have to read these number  and we go around here , every member .  So .  Miguel , please .  Hmm ?  But you can also , I believe , uh to have an ad - hoc network , where one node is then connecting to the outer world .  For instance , what I have in mind , you have a car , where you plug in different devices and they talk to each other , for instance ,  but one device decided to go to the G S M network or GPS network , or whatever kind of things .  So there 's a certain kind of task uh , for one node within the ad - hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world ,  right ?  OK .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Let me go back to your uh uh example .  Have in mind some routers are burnt here , at ICSI or whatever kind of thing ,  what will happen then even in a fixed network ?  So , if some sensors are getting out of uh service and whatever kind of thing , so the topology has changed , even if no node is moving .  Yeah .  And how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi within this network .  Uh .  Yes ,  this one .  Mm - hmm .  Um  Miguel , can you give some examples for such kind of protocols ?  One is really really  OK .  Yeah , yeah .  OK .  And the media is is is still occupied during that period ,  or ?  OK .  Yeah .  I didn't get it .  Um , what happened when I sent an RTS packet ?  Is then the media still occupied for me ?  Or , is anybody allowed also to send RTS packets ?  Because if I go to an intermediate node , maybe you are communicating to me  and I am the intermediate node to the final destination Michael .  And Michael send also some RTS packet in the time and and uh uh uh Jordi too and whatever .  Then you will never come to a really  then you 're always exchanging RTS and non - acknowledgement packets for the RTS .  So that 's uh that 's uh , my my problem .  Then , fine .  OK .  So it 's only related to the direct neighbor within the scope of the transmissions ?  OK .  OK .  I assume so .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Fine .  OK ,  but that means , in principle , that on the MAC layer you have always a RTS CTS packet between neighboring nodes ,  and you send afterwards the data .  But the data will be maybe delayed in the intermediate node because you have always be assured to be uh s uh uh RTS and CTS packets are changed before before you can forewarning the data ,  right ?  Yeah .  OK .  Now the p  Maybe it 's better to to uh , draw it on the  Oops .  So , maybe my idea first .  So this is what , node one ?  This is node two  and this is the source ,  and this is node three that is the final destination .  Yeah ?  Yeah , yeah .  OK .  But - but anyway , I would like to do that in the ad - hoc network .  This is maybe the sco this is within the scope of this , uh special network .  That means here that is uh within the transmission power .  So if I send an RTS , and get back , um , a CTS , then he is allowed to send data , right ?  So . In the meantime , when he gets this one , he also had to send RTS and then CTS  because this is the next next scope of the transmission area ,  and then he can send the data , right ?  ",,
Bns002.C,"That 's the case ?  Yeah ?  And that 's what I mean .  In the meantime , he c still can get some data here , where he try to get certain connectivity on the MAC layer .  Yeah ?  OK ,  and then he try to forward this data .  After that .  So he is definitely first to stop .  He has to collect all the data ?  Could it not be a little bit strange  because if that is starting a file transfer with millions of bytes , he have to collect all the bytes before he forwarding to to whatever .  Huh ?  One data p  He have to do it for all data packets ?  OK .  OK .  So but , in principle , when he receives the data packet then he The same applies for the next data packet .  but anyway in the meantime he has to forward the packet to the final destination .  Right ?  So it 's acting , in in prin  OK .  Yeah .  Naja to to  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , @ @ .  OK .  And delayed .  Yeah .  Yeah , but this is typical for MAC layer protocols , you know .  That 's  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's always true that only one node gets a media access , for one frame .  That 's the point .  We always said "" from data ""  but it 's really one frame .  Yeah ,  OK .  Uh - huh .  Maybe maybe you are right .  Yeah ,  but , Miguel , this is a good point from from Dietmar ,  but maybe here is a wall .  And this guy is behind the wall , so his transmission rate is something like that .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah , but um Miguel , if uh in the previous slide you mentioned that you uh are working also on adaptive power control .  Is it not possible then , if I send something and I could not find any neighbor because one of the cluster below ,  is it not possible to extend the power until the maximum  and if uh I do not have any connectivity with the maximum of power , OK , then I 'm lost anyway .  Yeah , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  mm - hmm .  And how do you  sorry Miguel  how do you check if if the nodes are moving randomly ?  Yeah , OK ,  maybe that 's applied for RTS CTS ,  but for the real frame ?  The frame could also be uh whatever , I don't know but a few hundred bytes , you know , that takes a little bit time .  Mm - hmm .  No , s  no sorry  m Yeah , that 's right .  But first of all it took place RTS CTS ,  and there could be , you mentioned , if it 's still occu if the medium is still occupied by another one , it will be delayed anyway to a randomly time .  Oh ,  so !  OK ,  y OK .  OK .  I see .  Yeah .  OK .  Oh yeah , something like that .  It 's OK .  Yeah , what I think Maybe some , uh cases why I go this way with my node , and suddenly , I s go out of the scope of the transmission area ,  because it 's really a random movement .  Then I still hear  this is during the data transmission .  Yeah ?  then  Oh , yeah .  Yep .  Right .  Nee .  That 's really right ,  but what I would like to say is that besides the RTS CTS behavior , you need certain kind of additional MAC layer functionality to deal with these packet .  For example , with transmission or or whatever ,  for whatever control , or whatever kind of things , you know .  Right .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Hmm .  OK , this is a question not directly related to these things ,  but maybe that 's why maybe only a short answer .  Uh , do you assume that power control will be issue also in the next years ?  In other words , um is the um success of having more power within the devices in maybe three year , four years , five years , for batteries , and and and @ @ and sofort so on  uh will it be succeeded that you have so much power available that this difficult mechanism who is in the wireless network will be uh out of scope ?  Because if I have a device which uh can I use maybe for twenty - four hours ,  I do not have , in principle , really the constraint to uh deal with with uh power savings .  OK .  Yeah .  That 's what I  Yeah , that was the reason I 'm talking about this is uh  Yeah , but anyway , that was the reason for my question .  If I save with a lot of difficult mechanism , within the air interface and between the base station or access point and the mobile node , one percent of the power whereas ninety - nine percent is consumed by packet processing  and and and and uh uh C P U or whatever ,  uh is it worth to have it ?  If I really , with a normal device uh with a battery lifetime of maybe twenty - four hours , thirty - six hours or whatever kind of thing And I think it will be increased .  As the more mobile nodes are in the world the better the battery will be .  So that 's was the reason for my question .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , I g got it .  ",,
Bns002.C,"Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  What do you mean by multicast protocols ?  Routing ?  OK . Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  And maybe we will have to explain a little bit for those who are not familiar with source routing .  You can have the destinations you would like to or the in the I P addresses of the intermediate nodes you still know  even if it 's not the direct neighbor ,  but one of uh where you really want that the packet went through , put it in the I P header .  So , and ,  this one is going then to this guy and so on and so on ,  until finally it 's reached destination .  And , that 's what I mean , you cannot put it thousand intermediate nodes in for example ,  but to put a thousand I P addresses in the header , so that the packet is for uh forwarded accordingly to  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's uh  You 'll know to remove h it 's h from the header , in principle , and and so on , until it uh reaches the final destination .  This one , for instance .  that may that the different parts could be one to number four .  Maybe two - B or three - B  Yeah , but nevertheless this guy is a is an gateway in the router for for this packet , you know .  And they remove itself from the header .  Yeah .  It must be not the whole path , you know .  Um , Miguel , are you familiar with these kind of proposals ?  That depends on the service level you want to be .  Definitely not a guarantee level .  But maybe something like a control load level or something like that , seems to be for me possible .  Right ?  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah , we can discuss later , off - line .  OK .  Yeah , but the  Yeah , but it 's really happened also in the riot case , you know .  If I get the wrong route with the RCMP redirects , it 's , in principle , then the same .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah , in principle , the base station .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  and Miguel , should I should ask you one question .  And uh uh in version one and two you you have different technologies .  You know , frequency hopping , uh two modes and and and also infrared .  Does it still apply for for the uh eleven - B ?  OK , DSS .  OK .  OK .  OK .  Megahertz ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , gigahertz .  Yeah .  In the RSM band .  Yeah .  And one additional question from myself ,  but maybe also short ,  because time it running fast .  Uh , I have heard that uh wireless LAN and Bluetooth will have some problems  uh that they influence each other .  Do you have additional information about this topic ?  Yeah , that 's right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , but nevertheless , you have the range of ten meters , or of one hundred meters .  OK .  Yeah .  Well that 's a good news , OK ?  But anyway , um based on your uh uh initial scenario I believe because Bluetooth is on one chip ,  like you have now your UCB buss or whatever connectivity , you will have your Bluetooth connectivity .  And that means your mouse , and and and  Yeah , and and and whatever kind of of eh things connected to your laptop and also your microphone and whatever you will will have , is Bluetooth - based .  Yeah , or will be Bluetooth - based .  Yeah , and this is this is eh within maybe an uh wireless LAN .  So , despite the fact that they are considered for different scenarios they are still  within one one area .  Yeah .  OK we 'll when I I will have some problems in the future with my l wireless LAN and Bluetooth connectivity ,  I will come to you ,  you will solve it OK ?  OK , please go on .  OK .  But maybe for cars .  Yeah , if your car is the infrastructure , for instance .  Yeah .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  many thanks Miguel .  Are there any questions ?  Maybe we have also the time to discuss with Miguel off - line the things if there is some uh question concerning uh his talk or maybe other questions .  Maybe one last question from my side  because I bring it up , uh concerning the proposal , some kind of active routing mechanism .  It 's going in a quite different direction as as as as the traditional things discussed in the ITF  and I currently do not have any idea whether active routing is really a topic uh , within the I T  Do you have certain kind of experience or do you know certain activities uh , in that area ?  OK .  I know , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , OK .  One more time , many thanks Miguel .  So .  So I will deploy a little bit information here from the uh project proposal .  So I have only  four .  Jordi is only a short period of time here ,  so he will get the colored one .  and take a look to  uh  Yeah .  Kill the computer .  Uh , So I started uh , for for advertising the project proposal here to provide a few slides  I think , first of all , Wilbert , is not here ,  ",,
Bns002.C,"second um , the um link here was uh enabling UMTS services and application ,  uh , I assume was not read yesterday night .  So I suggest we go roughly to the slides here  and um  The the problem is that , in principle , we have different scopes .  And motivation of the project proposal from my point of view is that we will have the um Wireless access networks for the next generation will be more flexible .  There 's a @ @ for uh current uh uh uh for for fast changes within this network .  And that means , if you go to slide number three , that we have um the possibility to to um having normal features in the mobile access network ,  and  and um  and um also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain , that it is possible to to uh use novel things  and and and new protocols and new technologies within this network .  On the other hand , in the internet backbone , uh we it is i impossible  and we see it on several examples  like this , MPLS ,  there 's quality of service support , and multicast  and all this kind of thing ,  that , based on the success of the internet backbone , it 's become uh very unflexible , to p uh fo for the provision of these things .  So , if we are going to offer building blocks , and provide novel solutions for the next generation of wireless access networks , taking into account , without modifying the end - to - end scope , then I think it 's really beneficial work ,  also for the use of interactive multimedia application ,  so as it is described in the uh project proposal .  Um the point is that um to start with um a bigger cluster of co uh of potential partners to do this really really really big work ,  seems not to be feasible in the next time .  because if you have settled everything , and discussed everything and and and and uh without any money in the background , and a lot of money in the background ,  that is not uh feasible from my point of view .  Nevertheless , I discussed , with a lot of partners , these things .  And today , uh Michael and me , we were on the UCB to discuss with a guy who is a professor who is probably interested in the application stuff .  They are going in that direction .  They have a small project funded by NSA  NSF ,  um , f for this "" intelligent classroom "" , is a little bit exaggerated , I believe ,  but going in that direction .  So there are a lot of interest ,  but without really hard money in the background , it is very hard to come to the initial steps .  And uh Juan Peire , one of the uh members of this NSA group has uh identified a certain kind of s start money , I would like to say .  So maybe if you start with a small cluster of um the constraints of this funding ,  and that means uh six universities and and institutions  uh , three in USA and three in Europe .  and of course , they are uh including the NSA group  and maybe that seems to be very reasonably , for me .  But then we have to align the project proposal in that sense .  Because then we cannot do do anything as it is described in the in the bigger scope .  So the point is um to reduce the overall picture , which I described in a few words , to the fact that we have really some work packages where we can focus on it ,  still fitting into the big picture .  Yeah ?  And so that will be the task of the next weeks .  And uh  I hope that everybody is doing his homework concerning @ @ for instance  uh alternative to the intelligent classroom maybe that we h can start here only with the N S A group  within this big picture  um with some work  that we put the pieces together .  Because I believe many are very flexible here  accounting also the future - coming uh joining people of the NSA group , to do some work here .  And if we are starting with a very very very small cluster with a common activity have maybe some starting funding for bigger uh radius of the of the the the uh project proposal , with the mind that maybe at the final stage it will becoming a European proposal with this uh the the whole funding .  That 's uh my point , and my picture I have in mind .  And I will go definitely back to Germany the tenth of December .  That is fixed now .  And I hope we can use these remaining weeks to have really progress in uh for the proposal in that sense what I mentioned before .  Because then I will make the advertising that is still worth to stay here ,  And I hope then Siemens will say OK for me to stay longer here .  And then I will come back maybe in the mid of end of January .  So that 's uh it 's a comment to the proposal .  So I think everybody should consider carefully , based on this statement I made uh next steps  and of course everybody has little bit other work to do  but it should be should be always an ongoing process until I will leave until the tenth of December .  OK .  Um  yeah  I will distribute all the things electronically  to all the  OK , take a look to slide of number two ,  Yeah !  You see uh uh University of Mannheim ,  University  ",,
Bns002.C,"also these are the official ones ,  You see that in the ICSI US on the U S A side , I believe that the home companies and universities are still contributing .  Yeah ?  but these are then the official ones ,  and I would like to have them  They say they are very interested in it .  Yeah ?  Uh a few words , the University of Mannheim is at location where Joerg Widmer is uh working on it ,  and I got the statement  uh they are very interested in that .  They did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom  but nevertheless they did a lot in networking stuff .  And University of Uppsala , Sweden ,  that 's the reason I invited uh Christian Tschudin , the professor who did ten years work in in active routing .  And uh OK the Universidad Nacional de Educat  Yeah .  Spanish .  Maybe we have a better expert to pronounce it .  "" UNED "" .  I always said "" UNED "" .  in Spain ,  uh this is this university of Juan Peire .  And he is also the one who had recognized uh  one  pair  pair  Not Parez , Peire .  PEIRE .  No , no , no .  Not not Paez .  Not .  Peire , P E I R E .  P E I R E .  You never heard from him ?  You can I you can mail him later on the informa  Then , of course , the whole N S A group  and also of the coordinator of all the things ,  then Georgia Tech , I have good relationship to uh the long lasting uh cooperation with Georgia Tech  and they did a lot in this area , also related to networking stuff as well as to the intelligent classroom stuff and the UCB .  We still focusing on maybe we can have uh more professors involved  which are working also on the networking stuff as well as on the application stuff ,  so that the UCB is clustered as one uh partner  but nevertheless with different departments .  Yeah .  So ,  But take a look to the slides , I will uh deploy it um uh electronically .  Sorry ?  I will send it electronically .  After the meeting .  I will .  Future .  And , maybe you take a look to the uh last two slides ,  um Um ,  maybe the GPRS picture is still uh available .  So you have , in principle , here now the mapping of the different areas , um within GPS ,  and , in principle , the same applies for UMTS .  There is no so much different .  Um . You always have the SGSN and UMTS ,  they are called three - GSGSN .  And you have the protocol stack  um in on the slide number five , to see what uh is going on .  And you see the difference .  The amazing thing is that you have IP over IP .  As you take a look to the the uh GGSN , you have two - IP layer functionality and and all those things .  And you have the GPS tunnel p uh protocol G T P between the G and the S and the GTSN .  And and so on .  So uh I believe they are very very difficult protocols stuck between the uh between the um um involved nodes ,  and making it necessary , in principle , to deal with our four building blocks in um yeah , I believe , in a difficult way ,  if , uh , we have in mind quality of service routing , and and uh qualit uh mobility aspects and and all this kinds of things for I P layer functionality .  So that 's , in principle , uh an overview , of the protocol stack  and the involved nodes ,  and I will provide more and more information  but um eh I have to also figure out everything from the scratch .  I am not a total expert for for the future wireless networks .  OK .  Then I would like to thanks everybody  and if there 's no additional question , comment , or or other remarks , I would like to start with reading uh these numbers .  OK , please the next one .  OK , thank you  Now , please let don't switch off power ,  I have to call Adam ,  so  So I suggest , @ @ now we will have in a few minutes we will have the coffee break , tea , cake , whatever , @ @ will will be offered ,  and then we will have a we can have a discussion .  ",,
Bns002.D,"OK .  OK .  OK .  Thank you .  Well , eh , I I have prepared , eh , a really short talk about some of the topics  I I have been doing some w some research work uh before coming here .  And eh , well , mainly I will present  uh Here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation .  I will present some ideas and some concepts about what ad - hoc networks are ,  about the issues in media access control in wireless networks ,  also about routing in such kind of networks  and , eh , I will make some comments also about uh the current standards of wireless local area networks  and finally , I will present the blueprint of of my research project or my research uh proposal here .  So the first thing is eh what an ad - hoc network is .  You know , uh , an ad - hoc network is made of wireless nodes .  These nodes of course can be mobile nodes ,  and , eh in this network there is no network infrastructure .  So eh the only active thing we have is the mobile nodes .  And eh  end - to - end communication , is sometimes , uh done by direct communication from one node to the other ,  because they can talk to each other .  But sometimes it is not possible , this direct communication , because nodes , end uh source or and destination nodes are um are too far away .  And in this case , it can be done , communication can be done , by uh using multi - hub routing .  So  an intermediate , or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination .  So  uh in a sense , what we have in this kind of networks , is that , uh nodes are as both arced as both uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes .  And this makes a uh difference from other kind of network .  And well , regarding the purposes of what can this kind of network be used for , eh we can say that , well , cellular networks are infrastructure - based networks ,  in this kind of ad - hoc networks , we don't have anything uh , with the exception of the network nodes .  So , this uh network can be useful for eh uh occasions where no available infrastructure is present ,  like for example , in in eh after some kind of of eh um catastrophe catastrophic event ,  or , also when even when there is a network available , we don't want , for different reasons , to use the available network .  This latt later case can be , for example , the use in military systems ,  where maybe we don't want to use the other the enemy network infrastructure , for evident reasons .  Yeah .  That 's OK .  That 's O K .  That 's perfect , you know .  This in this case , we will say that this node is acting as a as a gat external gateway , from this network to connect to other networks ,  and of course the underlying uh protocols can can be , of course , uh IP - based .  Uh , OK .  Here you have several several uh , proposed , uh , scenarios for for used this networks .  When no network is available ,  OK ?  And another another application , for example , NASA is is uh studying , is uh the use of these networks , these ad - hoc networks , for sending multiple probes , uh , um uh missions .  So , for example , all of you are aware of this uh the last Atlas , the last successful uh Mars mission ,  the cellular vehicle was only one , and was uh walking around , uh roaming around the base station , which in this case was the gateway uh node of this network ,  but it was only one mobile node , of course .  Nothing prevents ,  except well maybe the cost , to send not only one mobile rover , but ten tons of them , or or at least uh several of them .  So , uh  higher area could be covered , could be explored  and uh of course , all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad - hoc networking , , ad - hoc routing , to extend the distance , the maximum distance , than uh a single radio transmission will would allow .  OK ?  And in the other case , or the other area uh of of of application , is the so - called network of sensors ,  where we can deploy a set of sensors in a maybe uninhabited area ,  let 's say , for example , the forest ,  and we can uh take some information  uh , for example for for fire - fighting , we can just launch from a plane , several small sensors ,  and uh  these sensors can be for example , uh checking that there is no fire ,  they can have some kind of uh let 's say infrared technology sensor ,  so we can cover a huge area with only a small set of of sensors , and without any other infrastructure .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well ,  You know , it 's an interesting question .  Uh , the the main thing about an ad - hoc network is not that nodes move .  It is the way of topology changes can happen .  The idea that mmm , any change is possible at any given moment .  But you can of course ask , "" but if the nodes are not moving , what kind of topology changes can we expect ? ""  ",,
Bns002.D,"Well , eh , the thing is that usually in in a n in a network of sensors , what we have , or the idea is to have um , an important number of sensors , and maybe with a high filer rate .  maybe the batteries are uh exhausted in some nodes because maybe uh they are not being able to take uh , let 's say , any sun to recharge its cells ,  uh maybe some of them can be uh just uh out of order for other eh environmenta environmental conditions .  So uh the idea is that even when these nodes are not moving , they can start and stop working at uh , let 's say , higher pace .  Then , uh what will happen in a in a regular network , uh in a network where you don't have or either mobility or uh this uh on - off uh rate , high rate .  Yeah .  Thank you , Joe .  Well ,  uh , you know , and finally , uh , another non - military applications , where uh maybe a network is available , like for example , a room like this ,  where we have , in fa in fact , a wired infrastructure ,  but this uh possible application of ad - hoc networks could be uh , any place , any meeting room , where we arrive with our computers  and eh we just can communicate seamlessly to each other without any kind of access point , any kind of uh mmm external network ,  because the kind of work we want to do is just only local based ,  it 's only to chat to each other or to exchange files with the person , which is in front of us .  OK ,  but we n don't want to product pro provide , eh , access to the internet or something .  OK ?  And , of course , the same eh the same scenario , could also happen in a place where there is no uh , infrastructure available .  Let 's say a meeting room uh , in in the middle of the desert ,  OK ? ,  without any other network .  So  the point or or the question could be for some of us , the idea of saying "" OK ,  That sounds OK ,  but why not to use a longer transmission range , so we can reach any destination in just one hop ? ""  This seems to make sense because , well , uh we are this way avoiding all the routing problem  that , well , we will talk a little bit uh , about routing later ,  but uh  it it seems that i probably that the problem is is not an easy one ,  because uh a node 's moving , the route is changing ,  so w one can think that routing in this uh scenario is is a complex thing .  But the problem is if w we just uh try to put more power in each tr transmitter ,  so this uh transmitter can reach any destination in only one hop ,  what we are doing is uh to rising the power needs of each node ,  and also we are reducing the network uh throughput ,  because we are only allowing one transmissio one transmission at a time .  Because uh , well , we cannot allow several transmissions , several high - powered transmissions at the same time  because one is interfering with the other .  OK ?  We are  uh I think I 'm not telling it yet ,  but we are assuming that we are using a single common channel for all the nodes .  OK ?  So that 's why we cannot allow several transmitters in the same channel at the same time .  OK ?  So , the idea of hav having a longer transmission range is not a good one .  or at least it has the drawbacks um , um , I was telling you .  Eh , let 's speak a little bit about the media access issues in in wireless networks ,  Uh , you know , the easiest eh way to to show how this works is or at least one of I think one of the easiest is that this drawing , or this picture ,  what what we have is a set of nodes , each one at a different location .  At at at a at an at a given moment this eh node , this dash node is is transmitting  and uh , the arrows are representing this transmission  and the receiving nodes , these three nodes , are receiving the transmission ,  and I 'm trying to uh show the area , the covered area , for of this transmission by means of this uh dashed eh line circle .  OK ?  So , uh , any transmission has a maximum transmission range ,  and uh in the simpler way , we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter and a certain radius .  OK ?  The value of this radius is uh in principle , is a fixed value  and it depends on the uh power of the transmitter .  Of course , uh this is only our uh simplife simplified model  and of course this can be uh improved uh a lot ,  OK ?  And in fact the real behavior is not exactly this one ,  but uh for for what I want to say it 's it 's OK ,  it 's enough .  OK ?  So  what are the differences uh , in this in this eh wireless transmission , regarding uh to the wireless to the wired ones .  What what are the d the main differences .  ",,
Bns002.D,"Well , the main differences come from the fact that , uh in uh in uh wireless transmission we have a special domain we don't have when we are using a wire for transmitting a signal .  And the point I 'm trying to show in this picture , is that if for example , this other node wants also to transmit while this one was transmitting , if we are using some kind of carry detect scheme , like for example , CSMA , or something uh uh derivated from it , the problem is that this node will hear the g the m the transmission media ,  it won't be able to hear anything  so , he will conclude that no other transmission is going on ,  and he will start transmitting .  And if he does , what will happen is that this node and this other node will also receive this transmission ,  and this will produce , at least at these two nodes , a collision or a m a m a a re a bad reception .  OK ?  So none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly received at this node nor at this other node .  OK ,  eh , this problem is what is called  Oh , sorry .  uh , the  I think this is the previous one ?  This is the German  OK ,  thank you .  Eh  this is what is called a "" hidden terminal "" problem .  OK ?  because well uh this node is not able to hear this other node because of the distance uh , between them .  But Uh , this problem , as you can see in the in the picture , is uh really producing at least some reception problem at these two nodes .  OK ,  so it is it is a problem that we have to address  and it is a new problem compared to wired uh media access control .  And , uh ,  well , some devel some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions  and the main idea is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism .  So  we are um reserving a certain , and a specific uh , area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time .  OK ?  This is the basic idea .  Yeah ?  Yeah .  Yeah , in fact  This one .  This one , n next slide is  OK ,  in eh the the the main idea and and the base of most of this protocols , is what this the so - called RTS CTS uh dialogue .  The idea is that ,  uh ,  of course , this is only intended for unicast transmissions ,  I mean , only for when a node wants to transmit something to a neighbor node .  OK ?  But not to broadcast . Uh , to all the nodes .  OK .  For this for this eh , work , the transmitter has to send a a a reservation packet called RTS , "" Request To Send "" , before eh being able to send data .  And the receiver is expected to return back another packet called CTS , "" Clear To Send "" , to allow the transmitter to send the data .  If the transmitter receives successfully the CTS packet from the destination , then it will be able to send eh the packet , the data packet .  If not , it will h uh , back off , and it will retry uh sometime later .  OK ?  So the main idea  Uh .  Yes .  Yes .  The idea is uh , if I want to send you something , I first of all , I need you to answer me to be sure that you are my neighbor now  because maybe you are off or maybe you are uh too far away ,  and also because that way Miguel , for example , it may be is not being able to hearing me will hear your CTS and will know that you are about to receive uh data from me .  OK ?  So  in fact , forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh , used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a recept a reception is taking place .  OK ?  Or everybody  Yeah .  OK .  Two two things .  First of all , eh , this this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism ,  so it is not connected with routing eh , anyhow .  And , second point ,  eh  RTS  Yeah ,  RTS packets can collide to other RTS packets .  So , this mechanism is not uh preventing collisions ,  it is preventing only data collisions .  OK ?  So the  And and you can say "" OK ,  but what is the what the benefit is ? ""  The benefit is that , eh RTS packets and CTS packets are short packets ,  really short packets .  Let 's say eh eh 30 bytes or less .  while data packets can be much mor much bigger .  Let 's say uh one - K , five - K - s .  OK ?  So  a collision in this short packet is only wasting a small amount of time .  And , uh  if that way we can warranty that there is there are there is no collision uh uh , between data packet , well , this this is this means a a huge eh increase in network throughput ,  because we well , we we only waste really small time colliding .  OK ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  It is a reservation mechanism ,  so  if reservation doesn't work OK , if uh one reservation don't succeed then , uh , this transmission should have to wait .  until the reservation  ",,
Bns002.D,"OK ,  yeah ,  let me  l let me  Yeah .  Yeah .  Fo - fo for forget forget about routing .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  a CTS .  That 's OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  That 's it .  That 's  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , but eh a node is only is only involved in one transmission at a given time .  So  if now two has uh mmm answer with the with the CTS , it will be waiting until the data that has to come .  OK ?  Yeah .  But n not before .  Yeah .  Yeah , you cannot  No , no , no .  But we are we are talking only about a data packet .  at the MAC layer .  Yeah .  Yeah .  All the packets ,  all unicast packets .  Yeah .  That that true .  That 's true .  But not in the meantime .  After receiving You know , in fact , probably the routing protocol will need to check the address the the let 's say IP address , which is inside the data packet ,  so ,  you cannot u usually you cannot , uh , read the data packet until you the reception is over .  OK ?  because usually your network hardware only provides you a copy of a packet after ou a a successful reception  and usually you know that reception is successful if every bit has passed the CRC check .  OK ?  You have checked that the that this frame has received uh without errors .  OK ?  So  Yeah .  That 's OK .  Yeah , let me let me put some special representation of what we are doing .  OK .  This is the transmitting node ,  this is the receiving node ,  and these two areas , of course , there 's something like this , are the uh places of the total space where you can hear the Here , this one is the RTS and this one is the CTS .  So , any node ,  for example , this node is a neighbor of the receiving node ,  but it is not a neighbor of the transmitting node .  So when this node hears the CTS transmission that is performed by the receiver , this will be uh informed , that a recev a reception is taking place in in in it 's area .  OK ?  So  in fact , this node will avoid any further transmission until uh this reception , that will start in in a moment , is over .  OK ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Not  No .  No .  Let me let me let me show you one thing .  If this node was transmitting before , it should uh it should ha uh transmit an RTS packet in advance , OK ?  So this node should hear it before .  So this node is W won't be sending the eh eh CTS packet to the transmitter .  So this transmission won't take place .  M Yeah .  Yeah .  And , in fact , uh there is another detail ,  it is not uh uh uh uh in on the on the slide ,  and it is that both the RTS and the CTS packet uh , have a field , a control field where the total length of the data packet is shown .  So  when you hear one uh CTS or one uh RTS packet , you know that the frame that they are trying to transmit or , that this one is trying to transmit this one is about to receive You know the length .  You know the bit rate ,  so you know that the amount of time you have to wait until you can try to get the control , or t try to send your own transmission .  Mmm , yeah .  Uh , well , we are assuming that uh mmm all the all the transmissions are bidirectional .  I mean , uh you know it depends .  It depends mainly on on the antenna gain and the transmission power and the receiver uh threshold .  OK ?  S  So what what we are assuming is that all the nodes behave exactly the same regarding to uh transmission and receiving signals .  Yeah but but  yeah  but the but in this case , you know this this idea , this uh geometric idea , can be can be , if you want , uh deformed because of some obstacles .  OK ?  But this wall is working both ways .  It is not only making this node not to hear this one , it 's also making this one not to hear this node .  So  if they  Because of this wall , if they are not neighbors , well , we can represent this putting this node like here .  OK ?  No , but this is not the scenario we are assuming .  Yeah .  We are assuming all the nodes are exactly the same .  Uh , so they transmit the same power ,  and they uh have the same uh uh sensitivity .  So they can hear  If if if I can hear you , you can hear me .  and and the opposite works also .  OK ,  if you cannot hear me , I cannot hear you .  In a ?  Uh not really ,  but also depends on uh you know , for example power relationships , and antenna relationships .  You know , eh  Because  because for example , uh one kind of thing ,  OK , if I use a directional antenna , this is making that in one direction ,  I 'm getting more uh let 's say more gain than another .  And that 's true  but th that What is also true is that one directional antenna works both ways .  ",,
Bns002.D,"It provides you more gain when you are transmitting but also when you are receiving .  so , in general , in general even when if there uh if there i are different antenna gains , uh , you 're getting mainly bidirectional channels .  Only when you have a an important uh power difference is when l um , the communication can only work one way .  For example , you have one big station with uh a lot of transmission power ,  and then you have a really small mobile uh thing that can hear perfectly the signal from this uh uh bigger station ,  but it has not enough power to transmit something that can be heard here .  So um  But this this this is not our scenario .  In our scenario , all the nodes are exactly the same .  They they have the same uh signal uh behavior .  So  this is not a problem for us ,  at least for the moment ,  maybe later we 'll see some differences .  So  You know , the idea is that this mechanism is a reservation mechanism .  And what we are doing here is try to reserve the area of space we are covering  and eh here 's where our some of our work is done .  The main idea for for our work , is well , if we are using this reservation mechanism , we are reserving an area of space for a single transmission .  Uh , if this area is bigger than what is really needed , we are , somehow , wasting a little bit of space .  So , uh  our first eh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values ,  these uh the area , the covered area , for a single transmission , trying to get a minimum value ,  so we can reduce the not - used space for other simultaneous transmissions .  And this will lead us to a a better to a better network throughput , to higher number of simultaneous transmissions .  And , we have , uh mmm , worked about this problem uh , in two different uh ways .  One of these ways has been try to find a mechanism to uh calculate an optimal value for the transmission range uh , and to get an equal value for all the transmitters .  So , the idea in this first work was to obtain a fixed value for the transmission range .  And the second eh work , uh , it is about  Oops !  It is about uh , an algorithm to adapt the transmission power for every for every single transmission .  So , uh , in this second part of our work , we are using a different value for every single transmission .  So .  First point , what we have proposed is a way to obtain the transmission range uh for uh for an escenario where we know the number of nodes  and the area of deployment , we have a a fixed area , where we deploy all the nodes ,  we have a fixed number of nodes ,  and , uh we assume that these nodes are moving freely around this this area  and , uh , what we have presented , is a mechanism to uh calculate to obtain the eh transmission radius that provides at the same time that provide us the better throughput possible  the better possible throughput ,  OK ?  but without our network getting partitioned ,  which is a problem that we are trying to avoid .  You know , if we have , because of node motion , we have something like this ,  this is the deployment area of or or node ,  and if we have some nodes here and some nodes here , well maybe these nodes in this area , cannot reach the nodes on this other area .  OK ?  Uh , so what can we do to avoid this ?  Of course we can choose uh our transmission values longer enough to reach from so the nodes from this area will be able to reach the nodes on this other area .  OK ?  But , again , we can assume that eh if uh , nodes are moving , uh more or less uh in a random fashion , this configuration is not very likely to happen .  OK ?  So the point we ha what we have done is to present a mechanism would pr which provides uh one uh value for a given uh mmm probability .  OK ?  So we can say that uh a given eh value are @ @ for for the transmission range , will be OK for a given number of nodes , if we Sorry . for a certain , for a certain probability .  OK ?  So , the point is uh , we cannot say that this is not gonna happen ,  what we can say is this is not very likely to happen , if nodes move uh uh random .  OK ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  This is the next .  Yeah , th  u  e  e  Yeah ,  but this is this is a way that it is it is being explored by other researchers ,  but not not uh , by me .  But uh , there is , uh one , at least one person who is who is doing what they call "" topology control "" ,  and this is , uh related to to uh the control of the transmission power to get uh certain properties uh from your network ,  like for example , they are what they are doing eh is eh some people working for BBN  Ram Ramanatan is the researcher ,  and the article is is uh I think from from this year ,  and eh  these guys are doing eh what they call uh "" B - connected networks "" ,  ",,
Bns002.D,"they are trying all the network nodes to have at least two neighbors .  OK ?  And they are controlling the power to eh this g uh mmm get this this number of neighbors ,  but this is not what I am doing  and uh the kind of power control I am doing uh , um , is more or less presented here ,  and what we are doing is to transmit uh with the minimum power needed depending on the distance to the destination .  OK ?  Every transmission is supposed to be done to a certain neighbor node  we cull the neighbors to these nodes which are uh closer than a given distance ,  OK ?  and because we wanted to to compare our algorithm with something , we needed to compare it with the no power control ,  which is the usual uh mechanism at this eh media access control level .  So , what we are doing here is to to compare our mechanism against the no power control ,  but again we have to fix  in order to be able to compare , we have to fix a given whatever , but a given uh maximum transmission range to compare .  And , uh what we are doing is we are uh taking the advantage that we are u we have this RTS CTS dialogue , in advance , before sending the data , to uh agree with the receiver , the power level he is willing to get from us .  OK ,  so every single transmission in every single transmission we are checking with the receiver the power level we have to use for the data transmission .  That 's the main thing .  And as , uh  Well , uh we are assuming that e y for at least for uh veh uh you know , uh , car and and walking or or people riding a mo motorcycle the f um frame length is so small that only um very very small um space can be can be eh travelled while the transmission is taking place .  You know ,  in one millisec  Yeah ,  well , you just take the  Let 's let 's  no but  Yeah but , i let 's say you have one kilobyte .  OK ?  One kilobyte is uh eight uh bits .  OK ?  And eh , if you are transmitting at , let 's say , uh at one megabit per second , this means one microsecond per bit .  OK ?  So this only is taking eight milliseconds ,  which is not a lot of time if you are travelling , let 's say , at uh one hundred kilometers per second .  Oh per per hour .  Sorry .  Yeah ,  it will be delayed  but you will start from scratch again .  I mean , it will be a start with another RTS CTS .  OK ?  But , anyway , uh , well , depending on on the network , you now , the the the this  I will have to translate this ,  uh  It shou should be something ipsh  So , this should be something like  uh  thirty meters per second .  OK ?  So in in eight milliseconds , well , the amount of of space you are travelling is not too much .  For most of of of uh the wireless technologies ,  maybe not for all of them ,  OK ,  but I 'm of course , I 'm also uh using a conservative value for the transmission speed ,  now you can get much more speed than speedier interfaces than this one ,  but the thing is , uh , that we are assuming that for a given transmission , we can uh consider the network as if it were built of a set of static nodes .  OK ?  Motion will be important for routing ,  but for the media access control level , we are considering that motion can be con is not is not important .  OK ?  Yeah , but again again , what we are adding with this behavior is , uh uh a little bit more , probably some some uh small part to the uh bit error rate .  OK ?  Maybe this frame will won't be received properly , and , should eh have to be eh dropped ,  but anyway ,  eh even if nodes are completely static , eh some problems will happen in the wireless transmission ,  so  we won't have a hundred percent eh perfect eh channel anyway .  So eh if this problem , as you show it probably it 's it 's eh Y you can you can see that it is not very likely to happen ,  because you you you eh have to consider the probability that o of happening this  Hmm ?  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Yeah ,  sure , sure .  In fact in fact , you know I I I I I maybe I I I had to to prepare a more detailed eh , view ,  I I just was trying to do something soft ,  not to to bore th the public  but of course there are a lot of other smart eh things that are built in , in these protocols ,  like for example , an automatic , uh acknowledgement .  Some protocols used uh in the same way as this RTS and CTS packet some of them use , an eh acknowledge from the receiver ,  which is also a short packet ,  so you you are getting some kind of link layer uh acknowledgement scheme  which can save a lot of data transmissions  because eh usually when you send a a a a frame , you will want to some kind of acknowledgement back .  So , if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new RTS and a new CTS , well , this takes longer than just a link layer uh , extra packet .  ",,
Bns002.D,"That , of course uh is also contemplated in this eh packet length length or included in the RTS and CTS packets ,  so , eh , you know , everybody can wait until this uh acknowledgement is also transmitted by the receiver .  So  in fact , eh nnn some people proposing this mechanism is is showing a a b a big improvement  and eh there are a lot of other mechanisms , also regarding and a time - out mechanism , or the time - out algorithm for these retries when you try to send something and you don't succeed , uh , what what you the amount of time you have to wait until you retry again .  Well , uh , some people is also proposing different things , different eh algorithms with different results .  So , in fact , there are a lot of good  I just was trying to present a you know the main ideas .  So , I I I you know , ask uh You Feel free to ask uh whatever you want ,  but I I want to insist that it was just an uh a simplified uh version , a light version .  OK ?  well , uh you know finally this algorithm , eh , as I was telling , eh what it 's doing is to check with the receiver the power level to be used .  And it is very simple to see that some advantages can some advantage can be obtained ,  because the difference is eh if you don't have power control , you are using all the time the maximum power ,  if you have power control , sometimes you will use less than the maximum power  How often do you use less power than the maximum ?  Well , this will this will be connected to the motion pattern .  OK ?  Depending how nodes are moving ,  well maybe all the time all your neighbors are at the maximum distance  But , this probably , doesn't l look like uh something very very uh very likely .  OK ?  because well , l probably y what you will have will be some neighbors that are really close  others that are a little bit far away  and finally , these neighbors that are in the in the frontier of your of your coverage area .  OK .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , let let me let me answer you uh with a question .  Uh , If , for example , your car uh you you have uh an endless uh source of of gas , do you think it will it will be a problem , the amount of gas your your car is is using ?  OK .  It won't be a problem for your pocket ,  for your wallet ,  but maybe it will be a problem for the environment .  So , I think that the answer to your question is in this line ,  that uh if you have an endless uh source of power , well , maybe it 's not a problem , for the battery uh lasting .  But , it is a problem because you are using more area than you should .  And therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place at the same time .  And therefore uh the problem is not only connected to to the to the power  it is also connected to the net to the global network throughput .  OK ?  So  But , again , uh , you know , uh the the m  If you ask me "" what what do you think what will happen , in the industry ? ""  What I think that will happen is that they will try to get uh mmm better hardware than we have now  because now the problem with transceivers is that a lot of power is uh consumed at the logic of the transceiver ,  and not uh transmitted to the air .  It is not power transferred to the air .  So , the problem now is that eh most of the power uh , uh t uh a wireless network card is consuming , is is is drawn by the by the eh logic control of the card .  All the all the calculations ,  all the hardware  So , I am sure that eh that manufacturers will try to to squeeze until the the the last ampere f of of this eh , let 's say , eh wasted power ,  because what you cannot avoid is , uh  to p l the part of the of the radio frequency power you have to transmit .  I mean , this is this cannot be avoided .  But what you can avoid or you can reduce  and probably  because now it is the main factor , the main consumption factor , is the logic inside .  In the same way , at as as it happened with with processors , for example .  Now processors are much more uh power efficient than before .  OK ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , pero e  uh but  Oh , sorry !  But even if you if you don't have to to worry about eh your power source , you have to worry about your environment ,  about not using more resources that you don't own  that are uh shared about w w among the community .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  The destination .  Can take place at the same time .  That 's OK .  And to and to get the maximum network throughput .  That 's that 's the idea .  However however , and  uh , it is always some however ,  uh by applying this uh greedy mechanism , in in  or , more than greedy in this case ,  ",,
Bns002.D,"it could be , say , this stingy mechanism to trying to avoid to use any extra space is also leading to a higher level of interference at the receivers .  So , uh  at the end of the road , we have to uh look for some trade - offs to avoid too much uh interference at the receivers .  OK ?  So , uh at the end we are using a little bit more power than these mathematically minimum values .  OK ?  because if not , the uh  the frame error rate or the bit error rate uh , skyrockets .  OK ?  because of the of high interference levels .  A lot of simultaneous transmissions also means for each receiver point of view , a lot of neighbors or or nodes transmitting at the same time .  And , all the transmitters uh with the exception of the transmitter of my transmitter , are my intereferers  and are and all of them are producing less quality reception ,  so if they are a lot of them , well , uh the reception can be can be uh disturbed .  OK ?  And but um , um this is taking longer than I expected .  OK .  Let 's let 's uh take a k a a really a really light uh view at the at the routing in this in this network ,  which is another important area of of research .  You know , in fact there is a a group at the ITF uh called "" Manit "" .  This working group is is devoted to uh try to to present or to agree a common protocol for routing IP traffic on these eh kind of networks ,  on these ad - hoc networks ,  Uh , and  at this moment there are , I would say , a lot of proposals of different protocols uh for uh end - to - end traffic  and also for multicast traffic ,  on these networks  And eh well some day in the future eh , a protocol should be chosen  but , for the moment eh we have several of them on the table .  and eh any protocol has some advantages and some disadvantages .  The basic the basic problem we have to solve in in these eh routing protocols is the fast eh the fast pace at what eh topology changes can happen .  So  the problem here is that now uh one node is my neighbor ,  and next second , it is not .  So any route that was going through this neighbor now is is not possible  and should change .  And the problem is that well  uh an  an if you let me a personal comment , I think that one error on the group is not to agree a set of mobility patterns to to do the the tests .  because here , well , mobility is making these uh neighborhood relationships to appear or to disappear ,  So uh , it should be interesting if we agree uh a common a common set of motion patterns to perform the tests  because if not , well , it 's difficult to to perform comparisons uh between one protocol and another ,  a different one .  But anyway , now what we have is is two basic approaches to this this problem .  Eh , mainly what they call the practive protocols  which are um extensions of of uh um back door and link end state routing protocols  distance vectors ,  sorry , and and link end state protocols ,  eh , which are usually table driven ,  so you have a process , trying to to maintain up - to - date a set of routing table tables and the nodes  and eh every routing de decision is eh just eh looking up the table ,  and sending to the proper neighbor node  and , eh the other the other set of protocols are using a reactive uh approach  and these protocols are trying to work on demand ,  so they are trying to solve on only these routers that are needed  so when I want to send uh , a packet to a a given destination , first of all , I have to figure out the proper route for this packet .  And then , uh I 'm using soft routing .  I 'm I 'm including on the on the uh header of this packet , the set of eh nodes that should be forwarding this node to the destination .  eh of course , uh these uh two approaches can be can be uh somehow mixed  and some hybrid proposals are also on the on the paper ,  and eh  these proposals are are trying to get the advantages of both uh mechanisms  eh some sometimes making a kind of combination of of them  uh , let 's say , for example , using uh practive approach for the closer set of nodes ,  let 's say for the neighbors and maybe the next level ,  and , using a reactive approach  I mean , as our routing approach , for nodes that are closer than this practive area .  OK ?  and eh , well ,  u e a  some multicast protocols have been proposed for this scenario too ,  and , well , they have to deal with the same problems that they 're uh end - to - end routing protocols .  Yeah .  Routing protocols intended for multicast .  So , for for uh , for sending one to any .  Hmm ?  Uh well , the main the main problems that some of the solutions eh are exhibiting , is uh the lack of eh scalability  uh mainly the source routing protocols have a problem when you when you scale from or scale scale badly from tens of nodes to to thousands of nodes  ",,
Bns002.D,"because , well , you cannot have uh , uh let 's say , uh , an endless uh header length .  You have a limited a limited header length .  So  Yeah .  Something like this  So you your packet should look like like this way .  Yeah .  So this this uh header , well , it 's it 's a problem .  Of course , there are also some some solutions  like uh uh employing some kind of of uh hierarchical source route routing ,  so you don't have to put all the all the route  Anoth  Another problem eh , is eh trying to provide some quality of service in these networks ,  because , well , em uh change is is the only thing you know for sure , here  So , eh providing quality of service is also is quite a challenge in in this network .  But , again uh there are some proposals .  Not really .  Not really , because I don't trust  You know ,  uh , I 'm sure that the proposals are OK ,  but eh I don't I don't think that You cannot warr you you I don't think you can warranty too much in these networks .  So , I see this like a you know , a a topic I 'm not convinced about .  I don't trust you can really provide quality of service ,  but of course  Yeah .  You know , uh if you are curious , uh I can I can I can provide you the n some of the proposals  which include  Yeah .  And eh , finally , the other the other thing , which is also under research or under study is , uh to have some kind of a power - aware routing .  There are some proposals , too .  So that way you could  routing function could be connected with uh global or local power consumption .  So , for example , you could ask to u nnn , the network to transmit your packet with the lowest uh global uh consumption  or with your lowest local consumption , for example .  OK ?  I mean , would the option for me to to use less power when sending a packet is to send it to the closest neighbor .  OK , assuming that I 'm I 'm also using s or having some kind of power control thing .  so that way transmitting to the closer close to my closer node , is , uh something that requires less effort than sending to a more distant node .  Maybe the closer node is not a good uh it is not in the good direction to the to reach the destination .  But it is for sure the the less expensive uh thing for me .  OK ?  But probably this uh this is not something really useful .  And that ca what can be u really useful is to reduce the global power consumption in the routing function .  So ,  because in this way ,  well , maybe one node is is being forced to use more power  but but if we take a look at the whole thing , well , we can ask for a a low consumption route ,  well , the same way  as we are asking , for example , when we want uh some packet to be shipped in the real life , we can go and say "" well , we will we are happy with this UPS ground system .  What we want w is two - day delivery service , or w twenty - four hours service , and we are willing to pay more or less for this service .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's O K .  So , these are more or less uh some open problems ,  and uh well just a quick comment about probably  all of use are now aware of the availability of this eh standard the I - triple - E eight hundred and two point eleven  uh in fact it is it is powering you know , uh the evolution of the of the of networking industry in the wireless area .  And in the beginning , the first adaptors uh  Oops !  were only one and two megabytes per second ,  but now we you you can buy for for the same price for even the same price uh , the new eleven megabytes per second version  I 've been use it for for a while ,  and it w can tell you it works pretty well .  and uh , the thing is that these devices have two different modes of operation .  One of them , and probably the most popular , is uh l what we call the "" infrastructure mode "" ,  where you have a set of mobile nodes ,  and then you have one or more access points .  These access points are uh in fact providing the eh required connectivity from the mobiles to the network to the m wired network ,  and from there to the internet usually .  Yeah , yeah , we can call it a base station .  And , eh , the other mode of operation which should be appropriate , for example , for this meeting room example , uh doesn't require any any access point ,  and in this second case , communication happens f eh um from one computer to the other at the link ly layer .  OK ?  So , if I want to connect to uh , let 's say , Miguel 's , uh Michael 's , uh I I will send him a packet ,  and he will receive it , and that 's it .  OK , we can build on top of this some uh routing algorithm ,  some ad - hoc routing algorithm ,  but this is out of the scope of the of the standard .  And  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  ",,
Bns002.D,"For the  no .  Eleven - B is only for for uh radio  and it 's only for uh direct sequences spread spectrum .  But , in fact , there is an ongoing new version , I think it 's c version - A ,  but it is not uh commercially available  which w will use uh orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  and will get probably twenty - five megabits per second .  eh but , again , the will move to five gigahertz ,  uh five point five gigahertz ,  eh gigahertz , uh area of a spec expect uh spectrum  But now , uh current devices are split at  You know , that the old the old waveLAN are nine hundred megahertz version  and the new ones are the the eleven megabits uh are uh two point four m uh ISM band .  However , uh some old uh waveLANs are also , but not the older ones the oldest ones , are also uh two point four m  eh gigahertz . S  S  And the good thing is that now , especially with the new version , all you  you ca you you are you start to see uh compatible products in the market .  Because eh maybe because it 's the , let 's say , second version ,  but also because I think it 's the only way for this industry to take off .  because uh previous versions , if you buy , let 's say , waveLAN , you are tied to waveLAN al the rest of your life .  But now you can you can have interoperable products from several vendors ,  which is , I think , what , in the past , will power the ethernet uh revolution  You can buy any any compatible product  and and you know it will work with the other brand .  In front ?  Yeah .  Mmm .  You know ,  in the beginning , uh what w the  I think that to put things in perspective , what we need to know is what Bluetooth is and what Bluetooth is for .  And uh Bluetooth is mainly for cutting this cable .  You know , the other day I was joking about that our wireless microphones were not , in fact , wireless  because it had this wire ,  So , the point is that eh Bluetooth is mainly a technology for cutting these kind of cables .  You know , sh oh short short distance cables ,  uh , carrying usually really s uh , sh nnn ,  nnn  slow signals ,  or let 's say , boys and something like this .  Yeah .  Yeah , but you know , uh in fact  uh the initial version had only the the range of ten meters ,  and I guess that somebody at a certain meeting said "" OK , why don't we have a l an extended range version ,  so we could re - use the same technology for other purposes ,  different than the original ones . ""  So , em , uh , I have the feeling that this is u this is what is uh introducing some confor confusion in the in the Bluetooth  eh or in the way people is is looking at Bluetooth  because they can say "" OK , hundred meters is is is an acceptable distance ,  let 's say , for communicating inside a building , inside a a small office .  So , uh some people , I think , is being tempted to think that Bluetooth could provide them uh , some kind of local connectivity ,  but uh for for data for computing uses .  Eh , however , I think that the that the When you have tried uh current eh standard eh working devices , you you  working at at eleven megabits per second , you cannot you cannot switch to another thing , to another slower thing .  But uh even when they are using the same the same uh , um area of a s a spectrum ,  because Bluetooth is also intended to work in two point four uh gigabits ,  eh the technologies are different ,  you know eh Bluetooth eh is using a frequency hopping system  and uh  mmm  both uh dialing sequence and frequency hopping , spread the spectrum techniques , are also intended to provide uh interference l uh less , uh data transmission .  So , the idea is that these two techniques are intended not to interfere with any other thing .  So , even when I haven't tried , and I cannot tell you for sure , I think that the only problem one network will encounter uh in the presence of the other is a little bit of more noise .  And this will produce a little bit less throughput ,  but nothing more .  I don't expect any any more problem .  even the the the own Bluetooth specification is also  assuming that another Bluetooth or several Bluetooth networks c will be could be in the same area of space  and they are using the same hopping technology , frequency hopping technology .  But again , this technology is uh trying to avoid the other networks by choosing different hopping patterns .  So uh if several Bluetooth networks can can uh coexist without a problem , I don't see any problem will will happen if if we want to to make coexist one uh Bluetooth with another wireless uh local area network technology .  Yeah . I think so .  Yeah .  Five bucks .  Five bucks chip .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Will be .  Will be .  In fact in fact Bluetooth is also designed  to be compatible with existing digital European cordless telephones .  So , hopefully , we will be able to use some of our old devices or maybe our our cordless phone base station at home , with a computer . S  ",,
Bns002.D,"S So I think some really nice applications will will appear .  I 'll try to .  So , let me let me just uh finish , you know .  Uh well , this is something I , more or less , I told you .  and eh you know , the point , or or or  what the the spark of of my of my work here , or at least , of what I was proposing to work here , is the fact that these two model uh two modes of operation , I was telling you here that you have to choose at the driver level if your network adaptor is working in an access point - based environment or in ad ho in an ad - hoc environment . I see this as a as a limitation  because I think that uh when you have to choose among two options , well , mmm , maybe you are saying "" no "" to some of the benefits the other option , different than the one you are choosing , could provide you .  And I envision an an an m an escenario where eh  Oops !  Well , yeah .  Let 's go .  where we can have a kind of uh dual mode uh wireless network adaptor  So if we are not able to reach any access point but we are able to reach another network node , well , maybe this network node could do me the favor to reach or to forward my packets to the access point .  So the main idea , the driving force here , is to uh try to obtain uh , let 's say , hybrid mode  which allows an adaptor to work either in the access point or in the eh in the ad - hoc mode in a seamless way .  and to include in every single node driver ,  this forwarding or helper uh forwarding mechanism that will allow to extend the wireless coverage without a need of buying a lot of access points  and putting even an access point inside the restroom . OK ?  Of course this idea mmm , can sound p can sound a little bit not very appealing for the manufacturers ,  at least for the manufacturers of access point  because well , they probably are very happy of selling a lot of them .  Yeah .  So , this is the m I think this is near the end , this is the last  So  One possible extension of the same idea and something uh I 've been thinking for awhile , is the idea that , well , why can't do we extend this same concept to cell array systems ?  Why can't we , for example , think about some mmm , new mechanisms that users could get , uh connectivity by means of other users , and no directly to the base station ,  or , when we have several technologies uh in overlapped in a certain area , why can't we use the closest and the cheapest , maybe , technology ,  or maybe the less power consumption technology , without the user to worry about if he is now using this or the other technology .  And on the other hand , what are the billing implications of this behavior ?  Because it is clear that , well , when I 'm only uh , talking to the to the base station of my provider , well billing is more or less straightforward ,  but what happens if I 'm working uh , let 's say , uh across a mall , and at a given moment I 'm using the small base station of a cordless phone that is inside the shop I 'm at the window of ?  Well in this case , I 'm using a resource which is not owned by my provider .  I 'm using , a let 's say , a private property .  Maybe I have to pay to this private property ,  or maybe my carrier will have to pay or to refund some money to this guy .  You know this something , uh I 'm putting on the table  I 'm not sure about , uh if this can be really of interest or not  but , it 's an idea ,  and I 'll be happy to discuss it with you .  And I uh I think my presentation is over ,  So .  Oh , you are welcome .  Mm - hmm .  Nnn , no to both q to both questions .  I don't have previous experience  I don't eh know if uh where it will it would fix .  However , eh you know I 'm just doing this presentation  uh some somehow a review of my previous work .  So eh this eh doesn't mean that  I 'm I 'm probably getting involved a little bit more in this active routing thing .  So uh I I maybe I will be able to hopefully I will be able to to give you a better answer in the future .  Oh , than thanks , Michael , for your computer .  Should I power off it ?  OK .

So maybe  I don't know if this is different in Spain .  That would be fine too , to have some information , or in D nnn Holland .  I don't know .  Yeah ,  so how maybe how you did it or whatsoever .  So  yeah ,  then what else did I have ?  Then  another point 's like , uh , what about the bank ,  uh , so , transferring your money from Europe t over here , what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something .  um  another point  yeah , and then there 's there 's another point like going out in Berkeley or what to do in Berkeley or in the neighborhood .  No ,  I know .  I know .  But there 's nothing like this on the on the ICSI page as far as I know .  Yeah , but it 's not in the  This is not on the web .  Yeah .  I don't know ,  maybe I talk with Jane about this .  If we can use this information , I don't know , somewhere on the ICSI home page too .  Yeah .  Maybe .  Yeah , I talk to Jane about this .  No ,  this is why I have to talk to Jane .  Yeah , but this is not a problem at all ,  I I mean , if y you are coming from Germany and you know that there is something changed with the health insurance , then you send Jane an email like "" Could you please change this , blah - blah - blah .

Another point is I want I want to would like to add a another button , something which is called like "" events "" or , I don't know , yeah , I guess I call it "" events ""  like where we could s uh , announce talks which are , you know , future talks for the future ,  or and where we could also have a link on for instance the two workshops which have going on , uh , last summer ,  so , Hannes ' workshop and then the workshop from Oliver ,  that there might be a link behind these workshops and or former talks we have ,  so like from people who have been here before  and he wants to , uh , publish their slides , or an article , or whatsoever , behind there .  So , that we have like a button for events which are where workshops can be announced or old workshops could could be , um , shown or whatever .  No , it 's easy to to add it ,  I mean .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah , OK .  Yeah but this will be then down on the button of the page anyways .  Yep .  Yep .  Huh !  OK .

I had to put everything out  to to put the removable hard disk in  and and it 's  Yeah , it 's  but i but it 's not not , um very , uh difficult or something like that .  So you just have to  Uh !  So Wilbert will set up the second computer .  So it 's about one hour to put this , uh hard disk in  and a further hour to , uh Well , two or three hours to install the operating systems .  Yeah .  At the moment .  Right ,  um On Friday when I installed , um uh Linux the first time I got access to the local network here , um , but not to any machines outside of , uh , ICSI .  And , till Monday there 's no access at all to any machines ,  also not to inside machines .  So , I think it 's related to the work , um they 've done on Sunday here  and I sent  The pages are already on the web ?  Yeah .  OK .  Hmm .  OK .  But , uh  your argument is , uh , I think it we have to have the right to change it .  So if there 's anything changing in insurances or something something like that , that we have access to this page further on to chan to make any changes .  Yeah , but it 's much more complicated .  Yeah .  I think the best solution is really to put a link on the ICSI page to this stuff .  And the stuff itself is , uh , located at our server .  Yeah ,  in our directory ,  yeah .  Um , I don't know .  Maybe it could be a good thing if we have such an event button that , um , somewhere beneath this button or wherever , that there 's a date , when the last update was .  So that you know it 's worth to click this button to see there 's a new , um , announcement or not .  S So otherwise , you are often clicking this button  and you get your old information or even an uh empty page .  So  Yeah ,  something like that .  "" Last updated "" ,  yeah .  So it 's just a su suggestion  I don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that .  Holidays  And there 's no final master 's thesis or something like that what they have to perform ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  Well  I will  No , no , no , no , no .  So I will stay here till the end of February  and  afterwards , um , at Berlin I 'm yeah , funded by an institution of the German government ,  so ,  they are paying me ,  and I have to do research for them , of course .  I have to um well , uh , reach some goals and so on .  But on the other hand there will be some time left I think to do some work on this area I started here .  And for me , myself , I 'm also very interested in in continue this work  and so that will be manageable  and , um ,  on the other hand there are also uh , some students or  well ,  at the moment it 's quite difficult to find students , eh , who are doing their master 's thesis and so on  because there are not a lot of students , uh , which are in this state in Germany now ,  but um ,  about two years ago the numbers of students were , um , studying computer science , uh , started to increase again  and so in one or two years we will have , uh , many students , uh , which are performing their master 's thesis  and so I think there will also be , uh , many students which are joining in this work .  So , hopefully , uh , I will found will find some students which are joining in  and , um  So , hopefully this work will be go on .  That 's it .  ",,
Bns003.C,"But wh wh wh what are the box ?  But what w  OK .  You know , I I can I can build , eh , any computer uh you n installing whatever . It 's needed ,  I mean , I will enjoy doing it .  So .  That 's OK for me .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  I think so .  Mm - hmm .  That 's OK .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  OK .  OK .  OK .  Uh , there there there are couple of comments I I have about the web pages .  One is is the , uh , I think it 's Joe 's , uh , graphic , I think it should be better .  Maybe you are working at it .  OK ,  And then maybe the the ICSI logo could be could be could be ,  uh  No ,  it is just ,  uh  Maybe we can we can , uh , translate the white color into transparent color  so it will get more natural .  It 's just a suggestion .  To the home page .  OK .  That 's that 's OK .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  OK .  I  I will take a look and I will tell you something .  Mm - hmm .  Well , th they have uh , a a white booklet , you know , probably  No ,  no , no .  I I just I  In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example  when I tried the the phone on this booklet it was not working .  But the thing is that maybe this could be on a starting point or or if digest  It 's a common  Mm - hmm .  Hmm ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  that 's OK , too .  Hmm - hmm - hmm .  OK .  Oh , I 'll be I 'll be here until the end of July .  And , uh ,  well , eh  even later if , uh , there is some interesting work , uh , going on ,  well I I will be able to to do some work from Spain too .  So , that 's my future uh forecast .  Yeah .  Yeah , well , you know , uh the problem the I think that we have a a problem or a difference in Spain , at least , compared with the Americans .  And i is that our students are , uh are not getting involved in research until they have , uh , finished their studies .  So , uh , it 's something a little bit , uh , strange  but it is this this is the w  Yeah .  You know  You know , they  You you have to to pass the different tests  and you have to study the different subjects .  And , until you have finished with this , uh well OK , you can do it by by your own ,  but but the thing is that you 're not supposed to do it .  And usually students are pretty busy for not doing other things .  Uh .  Ah yeah em nnn , not really .  You know , there is .  There is .  But , uh , it is not a research work .  Usually it 's an application work .  So you build a web site , your own E - commerce site , uh , whatever ,  or a program or  but  But it is not , uh , something your teacher provides you some research papers and you , let 's say , build a simulator or try to .  So  we have , uh , other students are which are , uh , mmm people that has a grant  and they are they are starting as , uh , researchers ,  aaa , but this is only connected to your own funding  so if you if you have projects you can have , uh , people working with you .  If you don't have , a research project well , you cannot pay them  so u u usually you don't have anybody .  So it 's kind of , uh , dependent on the funding we have in some projects .  So  w  it 's not sure ,  not really sure .  Yeah ,  we we  I think we could We could find , uh , some , eh work force .  OK ?  Because well , you you can , eh , fo redirect you know , the the work as uh let 's say as a subject work of something that you can you can try to , eh , s  In some subjects , in fact , eh , the the the , uh , topics are more open  so you can introduce some research topics too .  So  but the main thing is that there is a , uh , this big difference  because , eh , students are not supposed to do research , eh , work until they have finished their gra their grade .  Yeah ,  sure .  Sure .  Yeah , I think so too ,  but , eh , you know , it also depends on the subjects  because sometimes subjects are fixed  so you cannot you cannot , uh uh , give any any stuff you want .  You have to to provide a certain a certain prime for the subject too ,  but , you know , sometimes , especially in the in the latest , eh uh , courses uh , things are probably more open  and , well , it it is something that can be changed .  Well , they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something .  Yeah .  ",,
Bns003.C,"There 's a connection point .  Mm - hmm .  Later .  Oh , not really , you know ,  uh , I I I I think that Well , in the future , somebody will come to the NSA group  eh  Ah ,  so  No , I mean that  OK ,  I I I think that it cannot , eh , be , eh considered the first type task to do  because nobody is is knowledgeable about multicasting  but I think that , eh , any of us could address these things in the future ,  or maybe a new person could address this . in the future .  So  if  I mean , wh what I think is that , uh , it it makes no sense to me to reduce , uh , uh , uh , uh , something which is more or less complete ,  because we don't have the person .  I think that the the way to to go is probably the opposite , to try to find something which has a meaning by itself  and then try to get the resources to to to do this  OK ,  OK .  Sorry .  Yeah ,  that 's OK .  Sorry , sorry ,  heh ?  Now I  OK .  ",,
Bns003.D,"OK ,  we can start ?  OK .  Thank you , Adam .  I will call you then when we are ready .  I believe , maybe one hour , in that sense .  OK ,  welcome to our next meeting .  Um I have couple of points we should discussed .  One is related to the proposal ,  Michael , please can you close the door ?  Thank you .  And , um  furthermore , as most of you know I will leave in tenth of December ,  I think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime ,  because I get , I would like to say , different signals from Siemens ,  I believe , in the meantime it 's a higher probability that I will return ,  but based on the pro uh , procedure to get a J - one visa and the IP six six it will be I would like to say , earliest stage will be end of January ,  so that means we have to get over six weeks  and  Then furthermore I would like to know the status of everybody .  I know for sure , OK , um Miguel , you will have your plans for this , uh , ongoing process , uh , concerning your work .  OK , from you it 's definitely clear , in principle .  OK , for Michael , what are your current plans  and Dietmar , maybe you then , also .  What we have discussed , in principle , concerning the ongoing process with U USAIA and also this , uh , your current work ,  and from my point , it seems to be clear that I will go back  definitely at tenth of December ,  and , as I mentioned before , probably will be more than fifty percent , I would like to say , that I will be come back to get the freedom to launch here the project in the sense in whatever kind of form and get , in principle , paid by another project within Siemens .  So the point is how long I will stay .  I believe , a couple of months definitely  and based on the success , I think that 's always an ongoing process to go back to uh , to Germany for a couple of weeks  and then come here and and go on with with this work  and  so that is my current opinion , concerning how Siemens deal with with my , uh , ongoing effort .  And , furthermore , I would like to First of all , thanks to uh Dietmar  because he started to use a testbed .  Eh  in principle , in his spare time .  Yeah !  Uh I will  So so the first , uh uh , box , this morning .  I will set up , definitely , in my spare time , in the evenings and the weekends the second box ,  and I 'm looking for two other volunteers who are setting the third and the fourth box .  A box is a s P C .  Equipped with with we should equipped it with with Linux  or maybe too with Free BSD ,  I doubt I don't know  and we 'll  And now we have an expert .  Yeah , to remov  So that you can pull eh the plug in the removable hard disk to the ID bus  and and OK , maybe it 's a little bit  Uh - huh ,  And  Why you are laughing ?  I ju  I don't know ,  I cou I s I didn't see him ,  so I don't know what he did .  I know in the meantime it 's running ,  and I will definitely set up the next one .  Yeah ,  though my idea maybe you eh can equip it with a  I don't know what your time constrain whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with Free BSD , for instance .  Yeah .  OK ,  uh - huh .  Do you find the time ?  Maybe also to uh support your  No promises ?  and even maybe to to , uh put your I G M P stuff on it .  Eh  No promises .  Ah , he 's very hard to sell .  Nee , because then the network is still running then .  Could we wait until the network is running ?  Because currently it 's not possible , uh , based on certain fire wall constraints .  I believe David is , uh , currently working on that . to set up the fire wall ,  and he 's not an expert for that  and when I get the signal I will ask one more time .  Nah , but nevertheless thanks to Dietmar that he @ @ .  Yes ,  we have , eh , for for secure socket ,  and , uh for web access , the fire wall is open .  That 's all .  And But currently it 's not working , right ?  But then ,  uh  Yes .  Yeah ,  You have internet outside access ,  but no telnet and not R - login or whatever kind of things , you know .  Yeah , FTP yes .  But no telnet .  Uh because you can  The the the point is that we will use it , as it is uh described several times , that we will use it as a local network , in principle ,  but it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of uh , media transportation f to put some stuff you need from your PC or your LS to this , uh uh , uh , to this testbed ,  you know .  So  you download it , if that s must be possible from the network ,  ",,
Bns003.D,"but normally it should be used as um uh for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than , uh , one box which you have on your desktop ,  cuz that is the primary , uh uh reason for this testbed .  So , definitely you have to have web access to download the necessary files .  So and then furthermore , one more thanks to Claudia .  He did a lot of work  and I could only pass her some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages .  And now we are , in principle , in the state we have to do it with a project area .  But they 're also some contributions from you guys requested .  Um  and the alumni page , in principle , we have to ,  you know , but it 's primarily my job , I believe , uh , to set up so that it is , uh adjusted really to the people who are worth to be alumnis  alumnis ,  yeah .  Is it "" alumni "" "" alumni "" ?  I 'm  "" Alumni "" .  I 'm not sure how to pronounce this word .  Huh ?  And , um  But , um  I think everybody should take a look to the web pages , and inform Claudia if something , uh , has to be improved or if there 's some comments  or  uh  He 's laughing all the time .  Why ?  Uh because it is you know , that 's very important  maybe now not for us  but maybe for our successors  and maybe somebody will come back once a day or send some students or some colleagues or whatever .  So , my point of view I will doc I will documented everything when I will leave here in the sense that potential successor as a group leader can hook in with these things and that these web pages will be updated every time when it is necessary .  We tried to do it , so that it must be at least updated only when really major changes happen .  So that means somebody 's leaving the group ,  uh , somebody is joining the group ,  a new project is started ,  but , uh , the effort should be minimized as possible .  And , so please take a look to the web pages  and  I have announced in the project area the major headlines .  And especially , Wilbert , maybe you can write something about yours ?  I call it , I believe , "" Multicast "" and then "" Development deployment "" , eh , for for source specific multicas  maybe a few lines ,  maybe a picture .  And something like that should be added to USAIA ?  OK , that 's my stuff .  And  um  then the next point is then this active routing stuff ?  Um  I would like to discuss it before ,  but you were busy .  And so  um ,  I believe , it must be adjusted to the current activities a little bit more .  And , um  I I think it doesn't  It is not worth to discuss it now  because nobody raised it before .  And , uh , so l let us have a bilateral discussion afterwards .  I would what I would like to have is that um , your contributions is related to certain kind of things happened here .  And that means really to the project proposal itself and also maybe to the USAIA architecture ,  in that sense , that at certain stages , cuz it 's a general architecture , certain stages maybe to future mobile core networks , that it is related to these kind of things .  Um , having uh , I what I have in mind is that things should not be started from the end system .  That 's my principle concern ,  because that will never be happen , from my point of view .  It should be started as the edge device ,  so that it cu certain kind of mechanism , whatever , is enabled between the ingress edge device and the outgress a edge device ,  because it will be at the certain stage IP based in the future generation telecommunication networks before its goal .  Fuel it to the over the internet ,  and b between these both boxes , I can assume uh because the mobility happens there as a normal natural thing  and the forwarding process and the routing process should be no more separated , from my point of view .  And to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism , that the packets can be used to set up the routes because they have all the information .  They know where they have to go because IP addresses are still there and within the packet .  I mean , how can this use , uh , within this area , and how this area is then aligned to the more traditional routing within the internet backbone itself .  That 's my question .  And I think that is good a research area ,  then I think there 's a lot of  I 'm not a e xpert at all for this .  But I I I believe , there 's a lot of potential for that .  And we should discuss it maybe bilateral afterwards .  Yeah ?  So , one more time , everybody should take a look to the web pages  and from Claudia , at the general remarks  and should write based on the , uh , headlines in the project proposal the um things what still happened , the things what they have still in mind  uh so that we can update these last @ @ you know @ @ present the last major part of the web pages .  Yes ,  ",,
Bns003.D,"you can now access it normally with maybe WWW ICSI Berkeley EDU ,  and  so .  Yeah .  You are definitely right .  It was in a good shape , but it , uh , then we disturbed .  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  I will send you some because I have something in mind .  Yeah , but nobody do that , you know .  So ,  that 's the point .  We discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago .  Uh , the point is normally it is an ICSI task anyway .  But  Right .  Yeah , that is from nineteen ninety - one or nineteen ninety - two , you know . A  A  And this is not on the web ,  and the the the  people  normally that 's was my my , uh  Hmm .  We can do that .  Yeah , but the point is that nobody feel responsible for that .  And if it 's  Yes ,  Uh , yes ,  I see there your point .  That 's right .  But if it is under the networking points , the group leader is responsible to get up to date information .  I believe , we are the group , where the people are , uh , changing much more faster to join the group and to leave the group as other groups .  And , so , the most problem as as of , uh , it 's likely that uh , the people here in this group needs this information um , much more f uh , often as as other groups .  Yes ,  I see th  Yeah ,  but we we can do that .  Yeah , that 's  yeah ,  that 's a  We have the we have the directory structure , of the real UNIX tree . in compliance and in accordance with what you with the structure of the web pages .  And , um , that means , uh , the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages .  He has access to the N S A pages .  And , um ,  but I think that 's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information page must be on the general , on the highest level .  OK ,  I have no problem with that .  But  but I think we discuss if still  Yeah .  You know how it you know the process here within the NSA group .  You know  And and that was a reason I we finally decided here that we put it information on the N S  A page , we have discuss dis this discussed still a couple of months ago ago .  In our directory .  Yeah .  Yeah , we can do that .  We then create a link and then we have to ask with Jane ,  OK ?  Of course that is a living thing .  I think it 's a good idea ,  not only that the workshop was a talk announce because they are still announce it is a broader sense .  Eh , but I think the idea from Claudia is very good , that the slides from the talks here , if it 's worth to have it on the web , anyway um , should be published in that way that the people can access it .  For instance I have my USAIA slides .  maybe if some things and is going on maybe you have some Multicast slides concerning your work at IGMP  and uh  and if we have some talks from EXTERM , and we had some in the past , we can also put the slides on on these things  because then they 're still cau still a growing context for us , opportunity for the people you know there ,  "" Oh ,  this guy did something there ,  maybe I can contact him and ask him would you like to do something , contribute , whatever . ""  Uh , so  that 's and I think it 's a great idea from Claudia to to have this event page  because it 's not a big deal ,  you know .  It 's it 's  Yeah ,  and then it 's  Nah , OK .  If there are no events , then there are no events .  But we still have a few which happened in the last year  and OK ,  then it is a growing thing  but it 's done automatically that the group leader or the group , uh , put some things eh , also on the web .  Something in the center pipe .  Yeah ?  Everybody agree ?  Maybe there 's  Yeah , maybe we can have "" updated on "" , you know the button itself ?  And then , "" updated "" and the current date , when when something happened .  I don't know how we deal with that .  Is it another thing we have to ?  Yeah .  OK you  Well .  Let 's consider "" update event button "" .  OK .  So , and then the next point and , I believe , yeah , So , not the last one , @ @ is one that I would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody concerning his future intention here at ICSI or whether e when he will leave whether he can contri or will he consider currently , uh , contribute here to the proposal  because you know , I 've I 'm facing the problem , if I go back to Siemens  and I say "" OK ,  there 's a potential . ""  "" There are potential contacts . ""  currently , maybe no money ,  ",,
Bns003.D,"but if we go in one direction it it is worth to know if people can still go on in that area of that kind of work then they are back in their university or their company or whatever .  and even if it 's nur unschl part - time jobs and and if it 's come to a real proposal , that maybe the people can hook in , uh , one more time  because I need this information definitely t uh , to inform the uh , the Siemens management that it 's worth to send me back here .  So maybe Wilbert you can start .  You will leave end of January definitely .  And currently you see no chance , as far as I know , uh , to stay longer here  and either you will go back to KPN or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company ,  is that right ?  Can you give us more details of concerning the status ?  No ?  Pending .  Yes ,  but you have no  yeah ?  So you are looking for a job .  That 's probably then OK .  in principle , I would like to say you are lost for the NSA group ,  because ffft that 's uh , it would be a a wonder if , uh , it hook in at the same area , you know .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I think so , yeah .  Ja  from the work contributions , you know .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh , do you know whether they have  Um , so from your side the statement is , um , that , uh , independently of your person uh , the KPN is not they 're not willing to send us another guy here to ICSI anyway .  And , if they are interested in uh , a certain kind of project then it must be related to a certain kind of really service or a certain kind of end system or real product or whatever kind of thing with respect to UMTS ,  right ?  Mmm .  So ,  KPN and and ICSI in principle .  After you will leave here that is .  Yeah , and then what do you intend to do in the last two months beside of course , looking for ,  yeah .  This is that from from Mark , right ?  Not ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , do you finish that and do you believe that you can finish that until end of January ?  It sounded sounded to me a little bit little bit , hard t hard hard time constraint , right ?  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  Mi - Miguel , maybe you can say also .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm ,  and , uh , do you have some students which could be join if there is  I assume there is a certain activity .  Maybe i if you will leave in July  What ?  They are not  sorry ?  They are not involved in in research ?  What they are doing then ?  I 'm sorry .  Huh ?  Ach so , ach so ,  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Why I didn't study in Spain ?  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Are certain tasks  and so ?  Mm - hmm .  Hmm ? No ,  there .  We 're not talking about to send the students here to I C  S I . I 'm talking if there is an activity , at least with the NSA group , that certain kind of activities also in the university could apply for the master works , of diplomas thesis , uh , whatever kind of thing that  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Thank you .  Claudia , I still mentioned , Have you other things ?  For me , as I said before I will be funded by a d uh by the ministry of , uh , the German government for research in the project so - called Invinet  That seems to be sure .  And I got absolutely freedom to do what I would like to do ,  and I would like to go on with the QS in advance mechanism  and , uh ,  in the relation of USAIA I also have the activities with Georgia Tech .  They have now a PHD .  It is settled ,  and my other next , uh , generation of contract is also going in that sense so the topic is still going go going on .  and when I will come back here , I would like to use these things too to maybe come to a closer , a bigger project um , outside of this goal , with contributions here from , uh first of all from the NSA group and then from from other partners .  But this I have definitely ou uh discussed with my management  and this will happened , I believe , in December ,  maybe , and in the beginning of January .  and I will keep informed to the management of ICSI anyway ,  but also , I assume that my suggestions that we have a weekly phone conference and email exchange during that time  so that we can inform each other concerning what are the questions , what are the problems , what is the status and so on .  Uh ?  But I think we will uh detail these things then in one of the last meetings .  So  how is your status and and your ideas and your plans and your future and  You 're addicted to the testbeds you run on the hour ,  so that 's  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  sounded good to me .  And Michael ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , then , what is the current status anyway ?  this is .  ",,
Bns003.D,"Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Now as I see , in principle , uh fff that 's a really raw view .  MPLS offers certain kind of success of active routing ,  because in principle , the forwarding pass is a little bit decoupled from this from the routing pass ,  and this was , in principle  OK ,  it 's it 's not really the subject  but in a broader sense it could be seen in that sense .  I think uh , there are in a certain degree some alignment with with both of you guys ,  right ?  Yeah .  Yeah ,  maybe it 's a separation , in principle , that I do not use the normal traditional , uh , data forwarding pass and update , in principle , only the routing information uh , to to to use it .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so what I mean is at a certain degree , yeah , that has to be figured out .  There is , uh , there are some linkage between them . @ @ in both of your your work .  So ,  my last point , uh , in principle , is the proposal itself .  Um  I know , in the past it was always if I 'm not writing something nothing gonna happen .  So , I believe , Wilbert , you are going out of these activity .  You have to use your time to finish your work as you uh , have in mind until your end of February ,  or is that right ?  End of January ,  sorry ,  so you will not y you will not find any time to contribute anymore to this activity .  OK .  Then from Miguel 's side I expect more detailed vision .  We can do it , as I mentioned before , bilateral afterwards , uh , concerning your work and how you think it could be beneficial contribution to the activity maybe based on the generic uh , uh , USAIA architecture .  I will write as long as I have time here , uh , on the proposal itself  and in the near - term future , I will distribute a list of the small cluster of people .  I tried to access Juan Peire several times ,  he didn't answer , because he still had mentioned that there 's some minor funding , that I think would help ,  for instance , to have initial meeting either here or in Europe or or wherever .  I 've , uh , contact one more time the professor ,  what is his name ?  Rao ?  or ?  uh , L Landay mentioned , uh ,  Rao , right ?  Yeah .  because he 's a professor in uh , responsible for the infrastructure at UCB and he has some projects which are related to um , these these , uh , activities  I would c c name it cor intelligent classroom .  I don't know whether I can succeed to get an appointment then  but I will distribute a list contact list and @ @ the interests of each partner  so that everybody can see and everybody knows , yeah , I have in mind  maybe it 's a small NSA group activity itself , with no linkage to the outer world  maybe it 's a NSA group activity with a linkage to the outer world based on the uh universities at home or the companies at home  there 's some linkage  and the third stage is , let 's say there 's a NSA group activity in this area , uh , with the supported , um , home entities and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or u or universities here in this area .  The last one , I think it 's , uh , the best one .  But , you see the question is always "" Where 's the money ? ""  and I say "" Oh poo ,  currently I don't know . ""  The second question is how long I stay here  and say ooo , I don't know "" ,  so  everybody 's waiting .  Yeah ,  and the only rea um , activity could come from the NSA group itself ,  but I think it 's a a work in process and that it will take some time and , uh , everything must be just settled a little bit more .  So , but anyway , I would like to get contributions from the people here of the NSA group concerning proposals ,  this is a living thing  and  it 's a pity that Multicast is , in principle , removed  and we do not have any expert from Multicast anymore .  And , uh , that 's makes very hard , I believe .  Because that is a major @ @ , at least twenty - five percent of the whole network uh , stuff  and , um ,  but neverless we have to live with this situation .  Right .  You are laughing , again ?  So maybe we have to rewrite something ,  have new ideas going forward more in certain kind of really telecommunication network and the routing and QS stuff ,  and remove , in principle , the Multicast stuff  which , in principle , a pity because I think that 's a really really good eh uh mmm source of research work for the future telecommunication core networks  because they are still not able to deal with Multicast ,  they still have there that tunnel generations and all those kind of things  and I I believe that would be very beneficial to use it for the really uh , mobile scenarios in in that network ,  so but anyway we have to live with a real situation  and that means we have to drop Multicast from the proposal .  Any comments ?  Then we can extend the proposal one more time with Multicast .  ",,
Bns003.D,"Oh , maybe you understand me in the wrong way .  Uh ,  I do not mean to drop it , to remove the text from the proposal .  I mean , activities , planning activities .  Work packages .  Yeah ,  so  no , no ,  because that 's , uh , that 's why I mentioned that it is important thing .  But , currently there 's only one new group member , Sven Buchholz , who will figure out the thing , hmm how to say , um , the taking into account the end system , or the limited end system capabilities with respect to mobility and the network itself .  Where it should be ada @ @ where should be , uh , the adaptation process performed to deal with the different devices , for ubiquitous access to the network ?  Should it be in the end system itself ?  Should be in the edge device ?  It should it be in the core ?  should it be on the server ?  These are the questions he would like to figure out .  And to p uh , to have , in principle , the pro and cons of , uh , different of all these different approaches .  So that 's the only new member .  Sven Buchholz .  He was here .  I invited him and discussed with him his potential work , I @ @ .  quite sure  Yeah .  But he showed up the next day  but only for administration stuff ,  but for the technical discussion he was here one day .  I I 'm do not remember whether w whether you were  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , he will come mid of January , I believe ,  yeah ,  as far as I know .  So , but this is the only guy , you know ,  but that is not reflected in that sense that we remove the text .  what I mean is is , uh , the that we what 's kind of activity we are going more in detail in describing , the network packages and and detailed , uh , uh , descriptions more detailed descriptions .  So  Any other question ?  Any other comment ?  Oh .  Then we pu should start with reading the numbers  one more time .  Yes ,  we have to do it ,  so that means we have to read the transcript script number and then the numbers ,  and if there 's a new line , a short break .  And , afterwards we have to ,  uh , that device is switched on ,  so please do not switch off the devices .  And I will call Herr Janin and that Adam @ @ .  So I will start .  one OK ,  Oh .

Bns003.F,"Yep .  Aber das wird jetzt geaendert .  Das wird geaendert .  But the problem is , are you allowed to change anything on the general ICSI server ?  Yeah .  So you may need just a link from the main ICSI page to the NSA page .  Yeah .  Yeah , but that 's that 's effort .  That 's the whole problem , that nobody wants to do it .  Yep .  So , I won't change the topic then .  I 'm here until end of May  and after that I presumably going to a Siemens project with some department of gee - mens ,  but related to that topic what I have done here .  So ,  it 's some of pre - stage to that ,  so it might be more related or loosely related .  So it 's at least it 's in the same topic .  And progress , it 's going on ,  but it 's not that fast going on as I would have like it .  Oh ,  I would like to have it .  Sorry .  Well  but oder ?  Um , I 'm currently I 'm looking into Quality of Service Routing ,  and I had discussions with a post - doc from the U - UCB .  Well ,  we want to we started to collect information to write the paper about Quality of Serving routing . for MPLS in an MPLS domain .  So you have um distributed routing at the edges ,  and one aspect is that the information is outdated , so that you know to always have the exact information of your links , dates , and so on .  It what we have plans of that .  And trying to look at some routing policies , or routing algorithms .  Yeah .  It it  It d yeah .  Yeah .  So at least from the desh definition of Christian Tschudin , MPLS is a subset of of active route active routing .  So it 's very It 's static ?  It 's No , active ?

Oh , I  Did you happen to find out anything about the OGI multilingual database ?  Oh , they are ?  OK .

No , between TIMIT and the the digits .  Oh , OK .  I see .  Out of that fifty - six ?  Oh , OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah ,  and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning ,  when really they 're both silence .  I th I think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty - six .  Yeah .  There 's not much difference , really .  And the ones that are gone , I think are I think there was they also in TIMIT had like a glottal stop ,  which was basically a short period of silence ,  and so .  I don't know .  So .  What about mel cepstrum ?  Or is that  you don't include that because it 's part of the base or something ?  It 'd be an interesting test just to have just to do MFCC with the neural net  and everything else the same .  Compare that with just M - MFCC without the the net .  Oh .  Where did th where did that come from ?  Digits ?  Oh .  Is that Was that distributed with Aurora ,  or ?  Where did that ?  What about TI - digits ?  Uh - huh .  Oh . Oh OK .  Ah .  I see .  What about combinations of things ?  Well , you just select multiple things on the one dimension .  When you do that , you 're increasing the size of the inputs to the net .  Do you have to reduce the hidden layer , or something ?  No , no ,  I 'm I 'm just wondering about number of parameters in the net .  Do you have to worry about keeping that the same ,  or ?  But wh what about a net that 's trained on multiple languages , though ?  Is that just separate nets for each language then combined ,  or is that actually one net trained on ?  In one net .  Mm - hmm .  I don't know .  Depends on the corpuses , right ?  Is it faster to do it on the SPERT ,  or ?  Is it ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So you 're just having a problem converting the labels .  Nuh - uh .  Right .  Yeah , I 'm not sure what 's available on  is it  you said Nutmeg  and what was the other one ?  Mustard .  OK .  Right , right .  Well , I 'll check on that .  What you can do , when you 're on that machine , is , uh , just go to the slash - scratch directory , and do a DF minus K ,  and it 'll tell you if there 's space available .  Uh , and if there is then , uh  Well , there 's different there , um , there 's  Right .  So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch .  And both of those two kinds are not backed up .  And if it 's called "" slash - scratch "" , it means it 's probably an internal disk to the machine .  Um .  And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a a a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , it 'll be called "" slash - X - something "" uh , if it 's not backed up  ","Did you happen to find out anything about the OGI multilingual database ?

Bro003.A,"and it 'll be "" slash - D - something "" if it is backed up .  And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called "" slash - scratch "" .  But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away .  It 's easy to unhook the external disks ,  put them back on the new machine ,  but then your slash - scratch is gone .  So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time .  But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch  because , um , first of all it 's not backed up ,  and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine  because you just recopy it to slash - scratch .  So tha that 's why I was saying you could check slash - scratch on those on on , um , Mustard and and Nutmeg to see if if there 's space that you could use there .  You could also use slash - X - whatever disks on Mustard and Nutmeg .  Um .  Yeah ,  and we do have  I mean ,  yeah ,  so so you  yeah , it 's better to have things local if you 're gonna run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , so , one of the things that I need to I 've started looking at  Uh , is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff ?  I 've started looking at , um , disk space .  Dan David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk ,  which means it 's not backed up .  So ,  um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space on other disks .  And , um , so far , um , I 've copied a couple of Carmen 's , um , databases over there .  We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott ,  um ,  uh , but we I would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also .  There 's there 's a lot more space there ,  and it 'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things .  So , anything that that you don't need backed up , we can put on this new disk .  Um , but if it 's experiments and you 're creating files and things that you 're gonna need , you probably wanna have those on a disk that 's backed up , just in case something goes wrong .  So .  Um  So far I 've I 've copied a couple of things ,  but I haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet .  Um ,  and I haven't looked at the any of the Aurora stuff ,  except for the Spanish .  So I I guess I 'll need to get together with you and see what data we can move onto the new disk .  I think that would be a I think that 's a big big deal .  Because the you know , the thing that Sunil was talking about , uh , with the labels , uh , labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff ?  The That that really throws things off .  You know , having the noise all of a sudden , your your , um , speech detector ,  I mean the the , um  What was it ?  What was happening with his thing ?  He was running through these models very quickly .  He was getting lots of , uh , uh insertions , is what it was ,  in his recognitions .  What about training up a , um , a multilingual net ?  Mm - hmm .  Another year .  So you 'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset .  It uses special diacritics and stuff , which you can't do with ASCII characters .  So the SAMPA 's just mapping those .  So they just throw the speech from all different languages together ,  then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters ?  Automatically derived  Mm - hmm .  Automatically derived broad classes , or ?  Uh - huh .  So you 're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words ?  Hmm .  So the targets of the net are these ?  Articulatory features .  But that implies that you can have more than one on at a time ?  Ah .  OK .  I see .  We could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too .  We could I don't know , if you had uh the phone labels , you could replace them by their articulatory features  and then feed in a vector with those uh , things turned on based on what they 're supposed to be for each phone  to see if it if you get a big win .  Do you know what I 'm saying ?  So ,  um ,  I mean , if your net is gonna be outputting , uh , a vector of basically of  well , it 's gonna have probabilities ,  but let 's say that they were ones and zeros ,  ","Dan David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk ,  um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space on other disks .

Bro003.A,"then y and you know for each ,  um ,  I don't know if you know this for your testing data ,  but if you know for your test data , you know , what the string of phones is and and you have them aligned , then you can just instead of going through the net , just create the vector for each phone and feed that in  to see if that data helps .  Eh , eh , what made me think about this is , I was talking with Hynek and he said that there was a guy at A T - andT who spent eighteen months working on a single feature .  And because they had done some cheating experiments  Oh , OK .  Right ,  OK ,  right .  And they they had done a cheating experiment or something , right ?  and determined that  Well , Hynek said that that , I guess before they had him work on this , they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right , it dramatically improved the result .  So I was thinking , you know it made me think about this ,  that if it 'd be an interesting experiment just to see , you know , if you did get all of those right .  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And then you also don't know what error they 've got on the HTK side .  You know ?  It sort of gives you your the best you could hope for , kind of .

Bro003.B,"Yeah , Oakland .  Yeah .  Other than the language , is there a reason not to use the TIMIT phone set ?  Cuz it 's larger ?  As opposed to the ICSI phone set ?  Yeah .  Oh .  OK .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well , we have that now , too , right ?  Yeah .  Or Swiss .  Swiss - German .  Did the Aurora people actually corrupt it themselves ,  or just specify the signal and the signal - t  OK .

There 's a computation limit , though ,  isn't there ?  Isn't there like a limit on the computation load , or d latency , or something like that for Aurora task ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  I don't know what a Ravioli is .  We can check really quickly ,  I guess .  Hmm .  It s also depends on the net .  How big is the net ?  How big are the nets you 're using ?  Uh - huh .  Hmm .  Huh .  SAMPA ?  What does "" SAMPA "" mean ?  So , I mean  I 'm sorry .  I was gonna say , does that mean IPA is not really international ?  Oh , I see .  Got it .  Fact , most confusions are within the phone phone classes , right ?  I think , uh , Larry was saying like obstruents are only confused with other obstruents , et cetera , et cetera .  Um .  The soft training of the nets still requires the vector to sum to one , though ,  right ?  So you can't really feed it , like , two articulatory features that are on at the same time with ones  cuz it 'll kind of normalize them down to one half or something like that , for instance .  Why don't you just choose linear ?  Right ?  Linear outputs ?  Isn't that what you 'll want ?  If you 're gonna do a KL Transform on it .  Oh , you  Yeah ?  Hmm .

That 's right .  Uh , between languages ?  Oh ,  um , right .  Well , there 's a mapping from the sixty - one phonemes in TIMIT to to fifty - six , the ICSI fifty - six .  And then the digits phonemes , um , there 's about twenty twenty - two or twenty - four of them ?  Is that right ?  Out of that fifty - six .  Yeah .  So ,  it 's it 's definitely broader ,  yeah .  Oh ,  you mean why map the sixty - one to the fifty - six ?  I don't know .  I have  Yeah ,  w I th I think that 's a good idea  to to talk about the whole cube  and maybe we could sections in the cube for people to work on .  Um ,  OK .  Uh , do you wanna do it ?  OK .

Uh , we ' r we 're gonna get German ,  right ?  Ge - At the final test will have German .  Right .  Spanish .  Oh yeah ,  we can we can test on s Spanish .  Oh yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . One hundred each , about .  Well , th  uh ,  when when I put these testings on there , I 'm assumi  There - there 's three three tests .  Um ,  type - A , type - B , and type - C .  And they 're all they 're all gonna be test tested , um , with one training of the HTK system .  Um , there 's a script that tests all three different types of noise conditions .  Test - A is like a matched noise .  Test - B is a is a slightly mismatched .  And test - C is a , um , mismatched channel .  Um ,  no , no ,  we 're we 're gonna be , um , training on the noise files that we do have .  Mm - hmm .  That 's a good question .  Oh !  Och !  Now , this is turning into a four - dimensional cube ?  Just  Oh , yeah .  OK .  No .  That would be  No .  Mm - hmm .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  I don't know .  I don't know .  Oh ,  I don't know how w how we would P - make this , though .  Um .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  The neural net ?  Um .  Yeah .  On a SPERT board .  Y you did a you did it on a SPERT board .  Yeah .  It 's it 's still a little faster on the  Yeah ,  yeah .  Ad - Adam Adam did some testing .  Or either Adam or or Dan did some testing  and they found that the SPERT board 's still still faster .  And the benefits is that , you know , you run out of SPERT and then you can do other things on your your computer ,  and you don't  Yeah .  OK .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Um , for the for nets trained on digits , um , we have been using , uh , four hundred order hidden units .  And , um , for the broader class nets we 're we 're going to increase that  because the , um , the digits nets only correspond to about twenty phonemes .  So .  Um , the broader broader training corpus nets  like TIMIT .  Um , w we 're gonna  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  More classes .  Right , right .  More classes .  That 's what I mean .  Mm - hmm .  And .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Um ,  I I was thinking two things .  Uh , the first thing was , um  we we actually had thought of this as sort of like , um not not in stages , but more along the the time axis .  Just kind of like one stream at a time ,  je - je - je - je - je check out the results  and and go that way .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right ,  right .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah ,  and the the second thing was about scratch space .  And I think you sent an email about , um , e scratch space for for people to work on .  And I know that , uh , Stephane 's working from an NT machine ,  so his his home directory exists somewhere else .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  OK .  Like a s like a slide ?  OK .  There 's ,  um  Carmen was talking about this SAMPA thing ,  and it 's , um , it 's an effort by linguists to come up with , um , a machine readable IPA , um , sort of thing ,  right ?  And , um , they they have a web site that Stephane was showing us that has , um has all the English phonemes and their SAMPA correspondent , um , phoneme ,  and then , um , they have Spanish ,  they have German ,  ",Y you did a you did it on a SPERT board .  ,
Bro003.C,"they have all all sorts of languages , um , mapping mapping to the SAMPA phonemes ,  which  No , it 's it 's saying  y can't print on ASCII .  So so , maybe we could look at articulatory type stuff ,  right ?  Mm - hmm .  Superclass .  Allows for ?  Oh ,  um ,  we have gotten soft targets to to work .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Mmm ,  I see .  To sum up to one .  Right .  Nonlinearity ?  Um ,  it 's sig  No ,  it 's actually sigmoid - X  for the  You ,  um  I think I think apparently , the , uh  What 's that ?  Linear outputs ?  Um .  Right , right .  Right ,  but during the training , we would train on sigmoid - X  and then at the end just chop off the final nonlinearity .  ","So so , maybe we could look at articulatory type stuff ,  ",
Bro003.D,"Channel one .  Channel three .  I was just wondering , does this mean the battery 's dying and I should change it ?  Oh OK ,  so th  Cuz it 's full .  Alright .  What a what about noise conditions ?  w Don't we need to put in the column for noise conditions ?  No ,  I just don't understand .  And do we do all our training on clean data ?  ",,
Bro003.E,"Hello .  Yeah .  At six .  Fill in the cube .  Yeah .  To fill in the cube .  Oh .  Sixty - one .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I th I looks the SAMPA SAMPA phone .  SAMPA phone ? For English uh American English , and the the the language who have more phone are the English .  Of the these language .  But n for example , in Spain , the Spanish have several phone that d doesn't appear in the E English and we thought to complete .  But for that , it needs we must r h do a lot of work because we need to generate new tran transcription for the database that we have .  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah databases .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Without the  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  And Italian .  Uh , no , Italian no .  Italian no .  I Italian yes .  Italian ?  Like Mexican Spain and Spain .  I think that is more important ,  Mexican Spain .

It depends on the  More than six hours .  For the Italian ,  yes .  Maybe one day .  Yeah .  Well .  Uh , M MFCC .  Uh , Ravioli .  mmm  Um . Who is that ?  I don't know .  I don't know .  It depends .  Depends on the corpus .  For Albayzin I trained on neural network ,  uh , was , um , one day also .  Uh .  I I think the neural net SPERT .  Yes .  Yeah .  Yeah .

It 's a bit I 'll do better .

And I working that .  But prepa to prepare the the database are difficult .  Was for me , n it was a difficult work last week with the labels  because the the program with the label obtained that I have , the Albayzin , is different w to the label to train the neural network .  And that is another work that we must to do , to to change .  Uh , for example Albayzin database was labeled automatically with HTK .  It 's not hand  it 's not labels by hand .  Labels .  I 'm sorry ,  I 'm sorry .  The labels .  I 'm sorry .  The labels .  Oh , also that  Yes .  The Spanish labels ?  That was in different format ,  that the format for the em the program to train the neural network .  I necessary to convert .  And someti  well  It 's it 's  Yeah .  Yeah ,  but n  yes ,  because they have one program , Feacalc ,  but no , l LabeCut ,  l LabeCut , but don't doesn't , eh , include the HTK format to convert .  And ,  I don't know what .  I ask e even I ask to Dan Ellis what I can do that ,  and h they he say me that h he does doesn't any any s any form to to do that .  And at the end , I think that with LabeCut I can transfer to ASCII format ,  and HTK is an ASCII format .  And I m do another , uh , one program to put ASCII format of HTK to ase ay ac ASCII format to Exceed  and they used LabCut to to pass .  Actually that was complicated ,  but well , I know how we can did that do that .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yes ,  maybe to , mmm , put together the the label the labels between TIMIT and Spanish or something like that .  Yes .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Hmm .  No .  The multiple language .  Maybe for the other language  because TIMIT have more phone .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  the tr the transcription , though , for Albayzin is n the transcription are of SAMPA the same , uh , how you say , symbol that SAMPA appear .  But I don't know if TIMIT o how is TIMIT .

Bro003.F,"So you think we 're going now ,  yes ?  OK , good .  Alright  Going again  Uh So we 're gonna go around as before , and uh do do our digits .

Uh so here 's what I have for I I was just jotting down things I think th w that we should do today .  Uh This is what I have for an agenda so far  Um , We should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh the field trip next week .  Uh a number of us are doing a field trip to uh Uh OGI  And uh mostly uh First though about the logistics for it .  Then maybe later on in the meeting we should talk about what we actually you know , might accomplish .  Uh  Uh , in and kind of go around see what people have been doing talk about that , a r progress report . Um , Essentially .  Um And then uh Another topic I had was that uh uh Uh Dave here had uh said uh "" Give me something to do . ""  And I I have I have uh failed so far in doing that .  And so maybe we can discuss that a little bit .  If we find some holes in some things that that someone could use some help with , he 's he 's volunteering to help .  OK , always count on a serious comment from that corner .  So , um ,  uh , and uh , then uh , talk a little bit about about disks and resource resource issues that that 's starting to get worked out .  And then , anything else anybody has that isn't in that list ?  Uh  Uh I think that means the battery 's O K .  d do you  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It looks full of electrons .  OK .  Plenty of electrons left there .  OK ,  so , um ,  uh .  OK ,  so , uh , I wanted to start this with this mundane thing .  Um  Uh I I it was it was kind of my bright idea to have us take a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning .  Um .  Uh this is uh The reason I did it uh was because otherwise for those of us who have to come back the same day it is really not much of a of a visit .  Uh  So um the issue is how how how would we ever accomplish that ?  Uh  what what what part of town do you live in ?  OK .  OK , so would it be easier  those of you who are not , you know , used to this area , it can be very tricky to get to the airport at at uh , you know , six thirty .  Um . So . Would it be easier for you if you came here and I drove you ?  Yeah ?  Yeah , yeah , OK .  OK , so if if everybody can get here at six .  Yeah , I 'm afraid we need to do that to get there on time .  Yeah , so .  Oh boy .  Anyway ,  so .  Yeah .  Yeah , so I 'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front .  And , uh , and yeah , that 'll be plenty of time .  It 'll take it it it won't be bad traffic that time of day  and and uh  Going to Oakland .  Bridge  oh , the turnoff to the bridge  Won't even do that .  I mean , just go down Martin Luther King .  And then Martin Luther King to nine - eighty to eight - eighty ,  and it 's it 'd take us , tops uh thirty minutes to get there .  So that leaves us fifty minutes before the plane  it 'll just  yeah .  So  Great ,  OK  so that 'll  It 's I mean , it 's still not going to be really easy  but well Particularly for for uh for Barry and me ,  we 're not we 're not staying overnight  so we don't need to bring anything particularly except for uh a pad of paper  and So , and , uh you , two have to bring a little bit  but uh you know , don't don't bring a footlocker and we 'll be OK  So .  W you 're staying overnight .  I figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase ,  yeah .  That 's sort of one night .  So .  Anyway .  OK .  Six AM in front .  Uh , I 'll be here .  Uh I 'll I 'll I 'll I 'll give you my phone number ,  If I 'm not here for a few m after a few minutes then  Nah , I 'll be fine .  I just , uh it for me it just means getting up a half an hour earlier than I usually do .  Not not not a lot ,  so  OK ,  ","Um , We should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh the field trip next week .  And uh mostly uh First though about the logistics for it .

Bro003.F,"that was the real real important stuff .  Um , I I I figured maybe wait on the potential goals for the meeting uh until we talk about wh what 's been going on .  So , uh , what 's been going on ?  Why don't we start start over here .  OK .  OK  Uh ,  So the HTK base lines so this is using mel cepstra and so on ,  or ?  Yeah . OK .  And again , I guess the p the plan is , uh , to uh then given this  What 's the plan again ?  With  So So Does i Just remind me of what what you were going to do with the what what what what 's  y You just described what you 've been doing .  So if you could remind me of what you 're going to be doing .  Oh , this is  yeah , yeah .  Oh ! Cube . Yeah .  Yeah ?  So - so we had talked I guess we had talked at one point about maybe , the language ID corpus ?  Is that a possibility for that ?  Yeah .  That 's really funny  isn't it ?  I mean cuz th this whole thing is for developing new standards for the telephone .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , I know ,  but the reason  Oh I see ,  so your point is that it 's it 's it 's uh the features are computed locally , and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions .  Yeah , that 's wh that 's wh that 's what I meant .  I said @ @ , there 's there 's there 's an OGI language ID , not the not the , uh  the CallFriend is a is a , uh , LDC w thing , right ?  But I 'm not sure  I mean , we ' r e e The bandwidth shouldn't be such an issue  right ?  Because e e this is downsampled and and filtered ,  right ?  So it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone .  And there are so many other differences between these different databases .  I mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car ,  and some of it 's  I mean there 's there 's many different acoustic differences .  So I 'm not sure if . I mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database , I 'm not sure if it 's completely rules it out  if our if we if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there 's gonna be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse f to sort of add another mismatch , if you will .  Uh , i i I I guess the question is how important is it to for us to get multiple languages uh , in there .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ?  And for the difference in phonetic context that you ? Provide that .  Well , we also have this Broadcast News that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is is microphone data for for English .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah , so there 's plenty of stuff around .  OK , so anyway , th the basic plan is to , uh , test this cube .  Yes .  To fill i fill it in ,  yeah .  OK .  Uh - huh .  But that 's  Uh , depen it depen it depends how you mean "" using the net "" .  So , if you 're talking about for producing these discriminative features that we 're talking about you can't do that .  Because because the what they 're asking for is is a feature set .  Right ?  And so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training .  But if we say , "" No , you have to have a different feature set for each language , "" I think this is ver gonna be very bad .  So  Oh yeah .  Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra .  So , we say "" OK , this is the year two thousand ,  we 've got something much better than mel cepstra .  It 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . ""  OK ? And so we give them these gobbledy - gook features  but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language .  Cuz you don't know who 's gonna call ,  and you know , I mean so it 's it 's it 's , uh ,  uh how do you know what language it is ?  Somebody picks up the phone .  So thi this is their image .  Someone picks up the phone , right ?  And and he he picks up the ph  Yeah . y y y  Well .  But , no but , y you you pick up the phone ,  you talk on the phone ,  and it sends features out .  OK ,  so the phone doesn't know what a what what your language is .  But that 's the image that they have .  It could be ,  but that 's the image they have ,  right ?  So that 's that 's  I mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years .  ","So , uh , what 's been going on ?  Well , we also have this Broadcast News that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is is microphone data for for English .

Bro003.F,"But the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone .  So that 's that 's what we 're involved in .  We might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years ,  but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for .  So so I think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language .  Now , it 's the OGI , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal .  And that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch .  And they may very well be right ,  but I I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true .  If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much .  Maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest doesn't matter .  Um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which I I guess they 're starting to look at up there , training to something more like articulatory features .  Uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages .  Uh , but  Yeah , so I don't th I know unfortunately I don't I see what you 're comi where you 're coming from , I think ,  but I don't think we can ignore it .  Yeah ,  so , um ,  there 's there 's , uh  This is complex .  So , ultimately , uh , as I was saying , I think it doesn't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language .  Now , can you include , uh , the the target language ?  Um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to  because then you can say when  because surely someone is going to say at some point , "" OK , so you put in the German and the Finnish .  Uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has Portuguese ? ""  you know ?  Um , and Uh , however , you aren't it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation .  So I would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other ,  because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we we note it and say , "" Look , we did do this "" .  Uh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's it 's not like there are I mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there aren't .  There 's you know , there 's fifty or something ,  you know ?  So ,  uh , an and they aren't you know , with the exception of Finnish , which I guess it 's pretty different from most most things .  uh , it 's it 's , uh most of them are like at least some of the others .  And so , our guess that Spanish is like Italian , and and so on .  I guess Finnish is a is is a little bit like Hungarian , supposedly ,  right ?  Or is  I think  well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family .  But they 're just these , you know , uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have I guess , people rode in on horses and brought their  OK .  Your turn .  Oh , good .  So are are you going to be assimilated ?  Mm - hmm .  And again , when y just to clarify , when you 're talking about training up a net , you 're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach ?  And and the inputs are PLP and delta and that sort of thing ,  or ?  Yeah , but your initial things you 're making one choice there ,  right ?  Which is PLP , or something ?  Yeah .  Yeah . Um ,  so so you take PLP and you you , uh , do it uh , you you , uh , use HTK with it with the transformed features using a neural net that 's trained .  And the training could either be from Digits itself or from TIMIT .  And that 's the  and , and th and then the testing would be these other things which which which might be foreign language .  I see .  I I I get in the picture about the cube .  OK .  OK .  Um ,  I mean , those listening to this will not have a picture either ,  so , um , I guess I 'm I 'm not any worse off .  But  but at some point somebody should just show me the cube .  It sounds s  ","But the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone .

Bro003.F,"I I get I think I get the general idea of it ,  yeah .  Ah , but which Dan ?  OK .  OK .  Well , especially when you go over the different languages again ,  because you 'd the different languages have different words for the different digits ,  so it 's  I I think it would ,  but but on the other hand it might be better .  Oh yeah ,  but still @ @ probably use it .  I mean ,  you know , I I I guess I 'm sounding cavalier ,  but I mean , I think the point is you have , uh , a bunch of labels and and they 're han hand uh hand - marked .  Uh , I guess , actually , TIMIT was not entirely hand - marked .  It was automatically first , and then hand hand - corrected .  But but , um , uh , it it , um , it might be a better source .  So , i it 's  you 're right .  It would be another interesting scientific question to ask , "" Is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? ""  uh . And that 's something you could ask ,  but given limited time , I think the main thing is if it 's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system ,  then it 's probably  Mm - hmm .  You mean a superset , sort of .  Yeah . Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Um , I forget if that happened starting with you , or was it o or if it was Eric , afterwards who did that .  But I think , basically , there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there .  Yeah , especially in a system like ours , which is a discriminative system .  You know , you 're really asking this net to learn .  It 's it 's kind of hard .  i It 's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like like , say thirty - nine , phone symbols ,  right ?  Uh , and then they get the variety by by bringing in the context , the phonetic context .  Uh . So we actually have an unusually large number in in what we tend to use here .  Um .  So , a a actually maybe now you 've got me sort of intrigued .  What there 's  Can you describe what what 's on the cube ?  I mean  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK ,  so even even though the meeting recorder doesn't doesn't , uh  and since you 're not running a video camera we won't get this ,  but if you use a board it 'll help us anyway .  Uh , point out one of the limitations of this medium ,  but you 've got the wireless on ,  right ?  Yeah ,  so you can walk around .  Uh , he can't , actually ,  but  He 's tethered .  Yeah and again  Yeah . So the the training for HTK is always that 's always set up for the individual test ,  right ?  That there 's some training data and some test data .  So that 's different than this .  Right .  Uh - huh . Ah . Ah .  Well , y you do have a baseline system that 's m that 's mel cepstra ,  right ?  So .  OK .  Probably should .  I mean at least at least conceptually , you know , it doesn't meant you actually have to do it ,  but  conceptually it makes sense as a as a base line .  Um , I think OGI folks have been doing that , too .  D Because I think that for a bunch of their experiments they used , uh , mel cepstra , actually .  Um , of course that 's there and this is here and so on .  OK ?  Italian .  The newer one .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so Carmen brought the Spanish ,  and Stephane brought the French .  Is it French French or Belgian French ?  There 's a  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  probably so .  Yeah .  Yeah , Herve always insists that Belgian is i is absolutely pure French ,  has nothing to do with  but he says those those those Parisians talk funny .  Yeah they  they do , yeah .  Yeah . But then he likes Belgian fries too ,  so .  OK .  y And I think Stephane was saying there 's there 's some broader s material in the French also ?  Spanish  I 'm just curious , Carmen  I mean , I couldn't tell if you were joking or  i Is it is it Mexican Spanish ,  or is it  Oh , no , no .  It 's it 's Spanish from Spain , Spanish .  Yeah , OK .  Alright .  Spanish from Spain .  Yeah , we 're really covered there  now . OK .  And the French from France .  Yeah .  From TI .  From i It 's from Texas .  So may maybe it 's  So - s so it 's not really from the US either .  Is that ? OK .  I think what they were saying was that , um , for this next test there 's gonna be some of the cases where they have the same type of noise as you were given before hand and some cases where you 're not .  So , presumably , that 'll be part of the topic of analysis of the the test results , is how well you do when it 's matching noise and how well you do where it 's not .  I think that 's right .  ","It would be another interesting scientific question to ask , "" Is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? ""  You mean a superset , sort of .  So , a a actually maybe now you 've got me sort of intrigued .  Can you describe what what 's on the cube ?  ","Essentially the cube consists of three dimension: input features;
training corpus; and test corpus. "
Bro003.F,"Well , not if it 's not seen ,  yeah .  OK . I mean , i i i i it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something that 's at least a little bit noisy it can it can help you out in other kinds of noise  even if it 's not matching  just because there 's some more variance that you 've built into things .  But , but , uh ,  uh , exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time .  So . OK , so that 's your training corpus ,  and then your testing corpus ?  Well , so ,  yeah ,  the final test , on a guess , is supposed to be German and Danish ,  right ?  Oh , there 's a there 's Spanish testing in the Aurora ?  OK ,  so , uh ,  something like seven things in each , uh each column .  So that 's , uh , three hundred and forty - three , uh , different systems that are going to be developed .  There 's three of you .  Uh ,  so that 's  hundred and hundred and fourteen each .  What ?  Are you just trying to be difficult ?  I 'm just kidding .  Yeah .  So ,  um  Yeah ,  so I guess the question is how long does it take to do a a training ?  I mean , it 's not totally crazy  t I mean , these are a lot of these are built - in things  and we know we have programs that compute PLP ,  we have MSG ,  we have JRA  you know , a lot of these things will just kind of happen ,  won't take uh a huge amount of development ,  it 's just trying it out .  So , we actually can do quite a few experiments .  But how how long does it take , do we think , for one of these trainings ?  Oh yeah ,  that 's right .  I mean , cuz ,  so , for instance , I think the major advantage of MSG  Yeah ,  good point .  A major advantage of MSG , I see , th that we 've seen in the past is combined with PLP .  Um .  Yeah ,  so , I mean ,  you don't wanna ,  uh  Let 's see ,  seven choose two would be , uh , twenty - one different combinations .  Um .  Probably  What ?  Yeah ,  I hope not .  Yeah ,  there 's  Uh ,  yeah ,  so PLP and MSG I think we definitely wanna try  cuz we 've had a lot of good experience with putting those together .  Um .  Yeah .  Well , so  I mean ,  so i it doesn't increase the number of trainings .  Uh , I don't think so .  Yeah ,  I mean , it 's just more compu  Excuse me ?  Oh yeah ,  we haven't talked about any of that at all ,  have we ?  Yeah ,  so , there 's not really a limit .  What it is is that there 's there 's , uh it 's just penalty ,  you know ?  That that if you 're using , uh , a megabyte , then they 'll say that 's very nice ,  but , of course , it will never go on a cheap cell phone .  Um .  And ,  u uh , I think the computation isn't so much of a problem .  I think it 's more the memory .  Uh , and , expensive cell phones , exa expensive hand - helds , and so forth , are gonna have lots of memory .  So it 's just that , uh , these people see the the cheap cell phones as being still the biggest market ,  so .  Um .  But , yeah ,  I was just realizing that , actually , it doesn't explode out ,  um  It 's not really two to the seventh .  But it 's but but i i it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings  cuz these were all trained individually .  Right ?  So ,  uh , if you have all of these nets trained some place , then , uh , you can combine their outputs and do the KL transformation and so forth  and and , uh  So , what it it blows out is the number of uh testings .  And , you know and the number of times you do that last part .  But that last part , I think , is so has gotta be pretty quick ,  so .  Uh .  Right ?  I mean , it 's just running the data through  Well , you gotta do the KL transformation ,  but  Good question .  One would think one net ,  but we 've I don't think we 've tested that .  Right ?  Yeah ,  so , I guess the first thing is if w if we know how much a how long a a training takes ,  if we can train up all these these combinations , uh , then we can start working on testing of them individually , and in combination .  Right ?  Because the putting them in combination , I think , is not as much computationally as the r training of the nets in the first place .  Right ?  So y you do have to compute the KL transformation .  Uh ,  which is a little bit ,  but it 's not too much .  Yeah .  So it 's  Uh , right .  Right .  So if you do have lots of combinations , it 's  How long does it take for an , uh , HTK training ?  For HTK ?  Really ?  Running on what ?  No ,  I 'm sorry ,  ","something like seven things in each , uh each column .  So that 's , uh , three hundred and forty - three , uh , different systems that are going to be developed .  so , there 's not really a limit .

Bro003.F,"ru running on what machine ?  Uh ,  I don't know what Ravioli is .  Is it is it an Ultra - five ,  or is it a ?  It 's a few hours .  Yeah . Right ,  so ,  I mean ,  clearly , there there 's no way we can even begin to do an any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines .  Right ?  So so w we  I mean there 's plenty of machines here  and they 're n they 're often not in in a great great deal of use .  So , I mean , I think it 's it 's key that that the that you look at , uh , you know , what machines are fast , what machines are used a lot  Uh , are we still using P - make ?  Is that ?  Well , you have a  I mean , once you get the basic thing set up , you have just all the uh , a all these combinations ,  right ?  Um .  It 's it 's let 's say it 's six hours or eight hours , or something for the training of HTK .  How long is it for training of of , uh , the neural net ?  Uh ,  but on what machine ?  OK ,  again , we do have a bunch of SPERT boards .  And I think there there there 's I think you folks are probably go the ones using them right now .  Uh , don't know .  Used to be .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So you could be  we have quite a few SPERT boards .  You could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on SPERT different SPERT boards  and and have ten other jobs running on different computers .  So , it 's got to take that sort of thing ,  or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these .  So this is  Yeah , I mean ,  I kind of like this because what it  No  uh , no , what I like about it is  we we we do have a problem  that we have very limited time .  You know ,  so , with very limited time , we actually have really quite a quite a bit of computational resource available  if you , you know , get a look across the institute and how little things are being used .  And uh ,  on the other hand , almost anything that really i you know , is is new , where we 're saying , "" Well , let 's look at , like we were talking before about , uh , uh , voiced - unvoiced - silence detection features and all those sort "" that 's  I think it 's a great thing to go to .  But if it 's new , then we have this development and and and learning process t to to go through on top of just the the all the all the work .  So , I I I don't see how we 'd do it .  So what I like about this is you basically have listed all the things that we already know how to do .  And and all the kinds of data that we , at this point , already have .  And , uh , you 're just saying let 's look at the outer product of all of these things  and see if we can calculate them .  a a Am I am I interpreting this correctly ?  Is this sort of what what you 're thinking of doing in the short term ?  OK .  So so then I think it 's just the the missing piece is that you need to , uh , you know you know , talk to talk to , uh , Chuck , talk to , uh , Adam ,  uh , sort out about , uh , what 's the best way to really , you know , attack this as a as a as a mass problem in terms of using many machines .  Uh ,  and uh , then , you know , set it up in terms of scripts and so forth , and uh , in in kind o some kind of structured way .  Uh .  Um , and , you know , when we go to , uh , OGI next week , uh , we can then present to them , you know , what it is that we 're doing .  And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently ,  that , you know , we 're not we won't be contributing that much .  Um .  And , uh  Then , uh , like , we 're there .  Broader class ?  Oh ,  it 's not actually broader class ,  it 's actually finer class ,  but you mean y You mean more classes .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Carmen , did you do you have something else to add ?  We you haven't talked too much ,  and  Well , um , JRASTA has the potential to do better ,  but it doesn't always .  It 's i i JRASTA is more complicated .  It 's it 's , uh instead of doing RASTA with a log , you 're doing RASTA with a log - like function that varies depending on a J parameter ,  uh , which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is .  So , it 's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in , is dependent on how much noise there is .  And so in JRASTA you attempt to do that .  It 's a little complicated  because once you do that , you end up in some funny domain  ","clearly , there there 's no way we can even begin to do an any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines .

Bro003.F,"and you end up having to do a transformation afterwards ,  which requires some tables .  And , uh ,  so it 's it 's it 's a little messier ,  uh , there 's more ways that it can go wrong ,  uh , but if if if you 're careful with it , it can do better .  So , it 's  So .  Yeah .  I I didn't understand .  Oh ,  "" l labeled "" .  I 'm sorry ,  I have a p I had a problem with the pronunciation .  Yeah ,  OK .  So ,  OK ,  so let 's start over .  So , TI TIMI TIMIT 's hand - labeled ,  and and you 're saying about the Spanish ?  Oh , I see .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK ,  yeah .  So you  Sure .  So it 's just usual kind of uh sometimes say housekeeping ,  right ?  To get these get these things sorted out .  So it seems like there 's there 's some peculiarities of the , uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out .  And then , um , if if you work on getting the , uh , assembly lines together , and then the the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line  and gradually can start , you know , start turning the crank , more or less .  And , uh , uh ,  we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at OGI ,  so I think that i if  What 's what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way ,  so that , uh , once these all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank  and and push all of us through ,  and then finally figure out what 's best .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , yeah , yeah ,  sure .  No , I 'm just saying , I 'm just thinking of it like loops ,  right ?  And so , y y y if you had three nested loops , that you have a choice for this , a choice for this , and a choice for that ,  right ?  And you 're going through them all .  That that 's what I meant .  And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , "" OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , "" you 'll probably find you can't do it all .  OK ,  so then at that point , uh , we should sort out which ones do we throw away .  Which of the combinations across you know , what are the most likely ones ,  and  And , uh ,  I still think we could do a lot of them .  I mean , it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something .  But , probably when you include all the combinations , you 're actually talking about a thousand of them or something ,  and that 's probably more than we can do .  Uh ,  but a hundred is a lot .  And and , uh , um  Yeah .  His his stuff is somewhere else ,  yeah .  Yeah ,  I mean , my point  I I want to  Yeah ,  thanks for bring it back to that .  My th I want to clarify my point about that that that Chuck repeated in his note .  Um .  We 're over the next year or two , we 're gonna be upgrading the networks in this place ,  but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines .  And we have reached the this the machines are getting faster and faster .  So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another .  So , you you don't w especially in something with repetitive computation where you 're going over it multiple times , you do don't want to have the the data that you 're working on distant from where it 's being where the computation 's being done if you can help it .  Uh .  Now , we are getting more disk for the central file server ,  which , since it 's not a computational server , would seem to be a contradiction to what I just said .  But the idea is that , uh , suppose you 're working with , uh , this big bunch of multi multilingual databases .  Um ,  you put them all in the central ser at the cen central file server .  Then , when you 're working with something and accessing it many times , you copy the piece of it that you 're working with over to some place that 's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there .  And then that way you you won't have the the network you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others .  That 's the idea .  So , uh , it 's gonna take us  It may be too late for this , uh , p precise crunch we 're in now ,  but , uh ,  we 're ,  uh  ","So it seems like there 's there 's some peculiarities of the , uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out .

Bro003.F,"It 's gonna take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gonna be getting . We 're actually gonna get ,  uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives  and , uh , put them on another another disk rack .  We ran out of space on the disk rack that we had ,  so we 're getting another disk rack and four more drives to share between , uh primarily between this project and the Meetings Meetings Project .  Um .  But , uh ,  we 've put another I guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch .  But , uh ,  are you saying  So I don't know where you 're  Stephane , where you 're doing your computations .  If i so , you 're on an NT machine ,  so you 're using some external machine  Do you know these yet ?  Yeah , OK .  Uh ,  are these are these , uh , computational servers , or something ?  I 'm I 've been kind of out of it .  Unfortunately , these days my idea of running comput of computa doing computation is running a spread sheet .  So .  Uh ,  haven't been haven't been doing much computing personally ,  so .  Um .  Yeah ,  so those are computational servers .  So I guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers .  Yeah ,  Well , you 're the you 're the disk czar now .  So  Yeah .  Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on ,  and I 'll be the one who says , "" OK , spend the money . ""  So . Which , I mean , n  these days , uh , if you 're talking about scratch space , it doesn't increase the , uh , need for backup ,  and , uh , I think it 's not that big a d  and the the disks themselves are not that expensive .  Right now it 's  But wasn't it , uh  I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash - scratch .  It 's more putting in d s XA or XB or ,  right ?  I see .  Right ,  so es so especially if you 're right , if you 're if you 're taking some piece of the training corpus , which usually resides in where Chuck is putting it all on the on the , uh , file server , uh , then , yeah , it 's fine if it 's not backed up  because if it g g gets wiped out or something , y I mean it is backed up on the other disk .  So ,  yeah ,  OK .  Sure .  Um ,  yeah ,  I I just  an another question occurred to me is is what were you folks planning to do about normalization ?  This being ?  Yeah ,  I think that 's a good idea .  I mean it 's i i we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is .  So probably if we sort of take their  probably the on - line line normalization  because then it it 's if we do anything else , we 're gonna end up having to do on - line normalization too ,  so we may as well just do on - line normalization .  So .  Um . So that it 's plausible for the final thing .  Good .  Um .  So , I guess ,  yeah , th the other topic  I maybe we 're already there , or almost there , is goals for the for next week 's meeting .  Uh . i i i it seems to me that we wanna do is flush out what you put on the board here .  Uh .  You know , maybe , have it be somewhat visual , a little bit .  Uh ,  so w we can say what we 're doing ,  yeah .  And , um , also , if you have sorted out , um , this information about how long i roughly how long it takes to do on what and , you know , what we can how many of these trainings , uh , uh , and testings and so forth that we can realistically do , uh , then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to to actually settle on which of them we 're gonna do .  And , uh , when we come back we can charge in and do it .  Um .  Anything else that  I a a Actually started out this this field trip started off with with , uh , Stephane talking to Hynek ,  so you may have you may have had other goals , uh , for going up ,  and any anything else you can think of would be we should think about accomplishing ?  I mean , I 'm just saying this because maybe there 's things we need to do in preparation .  OK .  OK .  Uh .  Alright .  And uh and the other the the last topic I had here was , um , uh d Dave 's fine offer to to , uh , do something on this .  I mean he 's doing he 's working on other things ,  but to to do something on this project .  So the question is , "" Where where could we , uh , uh , most use Dave 's help ? ""  Yeah .  The only problem  I mean , maybe that 's the right thing  ","It 's gonna take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gonna be getting . We 're actually gonna get ,  uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives  Stephane , where you 're doing your computations .

Bro003.F,"the only problem I have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it 'd be a good thing to do .  Um , I I think that  Let 's fall back to that .  But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something that , uh , an an additional  Uh ,  that 's a good thing you remove the mike .  Go ahead ,  good .  Uh ,  uh .  What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time .  Right ?  Cuz Dave 's gonna be around for a long time ,  right ?  He 's he 's gonna be here for years .  And so , um ,  over years , if he 's if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot .  But if there if in fact there 's something else that he could be doing , that would help us when we 're we 're sort of uh strapped for time  We have we we 've , you know , only , uh , another another month or two to you know , with the holidays in the middle of it , um , to to get a lot done .  If we can think of something some piece of this that 's going to be  The very fact that it is sort of just work , and i and it 's running programs and so forth , is exactly why it 's possible that it some piece of could be handed to someone to do ,  because it 's not  Uh , yeah ,  so that that 's the question .  And we don't have to solve it right this s second ,  but if we could think of some some piece that 's that 's well defined , that he could help with ,  he 's expressing a will willingness to do that .  Uh .  Uh .  Yeah ,  that 's something that needs to be done  in any event .  So what we were just saying is that that , um I was arguing for , if possible , coming up with something that that really was development and wasn't research  because we we 're we have a time crunch .  And so , uh , if there 's something that would would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first .  See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that that it 's to do to do a a a a poor job is is pretty quick ,  uh ,  or , you know , a so - so job .  You can you can you can throw in a couple fea  we know what what kinds of features help with it .  You can throw something in .  You can do pretty well .  But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that ,  and you worked on for few months , as I recall ,  and you got to , say ninety - three percent ,  and getting to ninety - four really really hard .  Yeah ,  yeah .  So ,  um  And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are ,  uh , even though we 're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it .  So if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing ,  take a while to develop .  Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic .  I mean , one I think one of the a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we we really do throw away all the harmonicity information .  Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes .  Reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail .  But the harmonic detail does tell you something .  Like the fact that there is harmonic detail is is real important .  So .  Um .  So , uh .  So I think  Yeah .  So wh that so the the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him work on the , uh , multilingual super f superset kind of thing .  Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it training a net on that , say , um , from from , uh from TIMIT or something .  Is that or uh , for multiple databases .  What what would you what would you think it would  wh what would this task consist of ?  Uh , creating a superset from looking at the multiple languages ,  and then creating i m changing labels on TIMIT ?  Or on or on multiple language multiple languages ?  Yeah .  Uh .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  What  Go ahead .  What , uh  Has OGI done anything about this issue ?  Do they have Do they have any kind of superset that they already have ?  Aha .  That 's right .  Uh , and that 's an interesting way to go too .  So that does make an interesting question , though .  Is there 's some way that we should tie into that with this .  Um .  Right ?  ","Let 's fall back to that .  But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something that , uh , an an additional  What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time .  but if we could think of some some piece that 's that 's well defined , that he could help with ,  he 's expressing a will willingness to do that .

So , if i if if they s  I mean , we have i we have the the trainings with our own categories .  And now we 're saying , "" Well , how do we handle cross - language ? ""  And one way is to come up with a superset ,  but they are als they 're trying coming up with clustered ,  and do we think there 's something wrong with that ?  OK .  What w  I see .  Right .  Although , you are not using this for the  You 're using this for the feature generation ,  though , not the  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But that 's what I thought they were gonna  Did they not do that ,  or ?  So  They 're talking about it ,  but that 's sort of a question whether they did  because that 's that 's the other route to go .  Instead of this , you know  Instead of the the the the superclass thing ,  which is to take  So suppose y you don't really mark arti  To really mark articulatory features , you really wanna look at the acoustics and and see where everything is ,  and we 're not gonna do that .  So ,  uh , the second class way of doing it is to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled  and translate them into acoustic uh , uh articulatory , uh , uh , features .  So it won't really be right .  You won't really have these overlapping things and so forth ,  but  Articulatory feature .  Right .  That 's right .  You either do that or you have multiple nets .  Um . And , um  I don't know if our software this if the qu versions of the Quicknet that we 're using allows for that .  Do you know ?  Multiple targets being one ?  OK .  So that that 'll work ,  yeah .  OK .  So , um ,  that 's another thing that could be done  is that we could we could , uh , just translate instead of translating to a superset , just translate to articulatory features , some set of articulatory features and train with that .  Now the fact even though it 's a smaller number , it 's still fine  because you have the the , uh , combinations .  So , in fact , it has every , you know it had has has every distinction in it that you would have the other way .  But it should go across languages better .  No .  This was the guy that we were just talking a that we saw on campus .  So , this was Larry Saul who did this did this .  He used sonorants .  Was what he was doing .  Yeah .  He he di he didn't mention that part .  But .  I see .  OK .  Should be .  Because if you get all of them in there , that defines all of the phones .  So that 's that 's equivalent to saying that you 've got got all the phones right .  So , if that doesn't help , there 's  Although , yeah , it would be make an interesting cheating experiment  because we are using it in this funny way ,  where we 're converting it into features .  Yeah .  Did we just run out of disk ,  or ?  So , we 're we 're we 're off the air ,  or ?  About to be off the air .  ","because that 's that 's the other route to go .

If it 's th in the phone ,  but  well , it that that could be th at the server 's side ,  and , well . Mmm , yeah .  Yeah .  So we we really have to do test with a real cross - language .

Do you mean if it 's trained only on On data from just that task ,  that language ?  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  So what 's th  In  The three languages is not digits ,  it 's the broad data .  OK .  And so , remind me ,  the multilingual stuff is just the broad data .  Right ?  It 's not the digits .  So it 's the combination of two things there .

In in the upper part in the English stuff , it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine ?  and that 's in the uh the third section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA ,  sort of the middle column ?  I is that a noisy condition ?  So that 's matched training ?  Is that what that is ?  So why do you get your best number in  Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ?  Ah ,  OK  so these are not  OK ,  alright , I see .  OK .  And then so , in the in the um in the non - mismatched clean case , your best one was under MFCC ?  That sixty - one point four ?  Oh ! So this upper third ?  Uh that 's still noisy ?  Ah , OK .  Mm - hmm .  I see .  Where is that ?  seventy - nine , fifty  Oh I see , OK .  I think they have one output .  They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature .  Does does anybody know how they 're using it ?  But that  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So it 's it 's  I don't understand .  You mean it 's throwing out frames ?  Before  Yeah .  Yeah ,  that 's what I was just gonna ask .  How can you just throw out frames ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  In the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of .  So that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet .  Yeah . Yeah .  I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this .  Mm - hmm .  Plus it 's gonna introduce delays .  Mmm .  Ah .  When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's knows when it 's time to back trace or something ?  Oh , right .  Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ?  Hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Some constant vector .  I mean  i w Or something  That 's right .  But something that  what I mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech .  So that the the silence model in HTK will always pick it up .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Cuz you gotta do something . Otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together  Yeah .  Yeah , right .  Yeah , yeah .  They have a they have a thing for doing that  and th they have for awhile , in H T  And you can parallelize the training .  And run it on several machines  and it just basically keeps counts .  And there 's something a final thing that you run  and it accumulates all the counts together .

varies, and a variety of input features have been tried. "
Bro004.B,"OK .  Wow !  Unprecedented .  Uh , you think that 's you ?  Oh .  OK .  OK .  So , um I guess we are um gonna do the digits at the end .

And I 'm channel uh two I think ,  or channel  Oh , I 'm channel must be channel one .  Channel one ?  Yes , OK .  OK .  So uh I also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail I think from uh from OGI  and we 'll go go through them also .  So where are we on on uh our runs ?  Excuse me .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Our our uh There 's a We 're pausing for a photo  We 're pausing for a photo opportunity here .  Uh . Uh .  So .  OK .  He 's facing this way .  What ?  OK , this this would be a good section for our silence detection .  Um Oh .  OK . So um , you were saying about the training data  Yeah .  So how  I mean clearly it 's gonna be good then  but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ?  I mean , my assump  From what I saw from the earlier results , uh I guess last week , was that um , if you trained on one language and tested on another , say , that the results were were relatively poor .  But but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another , does that is that improve things i c in comparison ?  No , no , no .  Different lang  So um If you train on TI - digits and test on Italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say .  I don't have the numbers in front of me ,  so I 'm just imagining .  E So , you didn't train on TIMIT and test on on Italian digits , say ?  OK .  W which in  It has three languages .  That 's including the w the the  the one that it 's  Right .  Oh , OK ,  yeah , so , that is what I wanted to know .  I just wasn't saying it very well , I guess .  Relative .  Right .  Ab - about how much ?  Twenty percent further ?  Yes . And it 's something like one point three of of the uh  I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline ,  you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task ,  and something like one point three for three three languages broad stuff .  I I I 'm sorry .  I I I meant something different by baseline  So let me let me  Um , so , um  OK , fine .  Let 's let 's use the conventional meaning of baseline .  I I By baseline here I meant uh using the task specific data .  But uh uh , because that 's what you were just doing with this ten percent .  So I was just I just trying to understand that .  So if we call a factor of w just one , just normalized to one , the word error rate that you have for using TI - digits as as training and TI - digits as test ,  uh different words , I 'm sure ,  but but uh , uh the same task and so on .  If we call that "" one "" , then what you 're saying is that the word error rate for the same language but using uh different training data than you 're testing on , say TIMIT and so forth , it 's one point one .  Right .  And if it 's  you do go to three languages including the English , it 's something like one point three .  That 's what you were just saying , I think .  OK .  And if you exclude English , from this combination , what 's that ?  Aha !  That 's interesting . That 's interesting .  Do you see ? Because Uh ,  so No , that that 's important .  So what what it 's saying here is just that  "" yes ,  there is a reduction in performance , when you don't um have the s when you don't have um  Wait a minute ,  th th the  No , actually it 's interesting .  So it 's So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so different .  It 's when you went to these  So what 's the difference between two and three ?  Between the one point one case and the one point four case ?  I 'm confused .  Cuz in both in both both of those cases , you don't have the same task .  So is is the training data for the for this one point four case  does it include the training data for the one point one case ?  How m how much bigger is it ?  So it 's two times ,  but it includes the but it includes the broad English data .  And the broad English data is what you got this one point one with .  So that 's TIMIT basically  right ?  So it 's band - limited TIMIT .  This is all eight kilohertz sampling .  So you have band - limited TIMIT , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using TI - digits on a TI - digits test .  OK ?  Um and um  ",So where are we on on uh our runs ?  That 's including the w the the  the one that it 's  ,"The meeting was dominated by a discussion of the first results coming
in. There have been four types of test, in which the training data
varies, and a variety of input features have been tried. "
Bro004.B,"But , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it um performs worse on the TI - digits .  OK , now all of this is This is noisy TI - digits , I assume ?  Both training and test ?  Yeah .  OK .  Um  OK . Well . We we we may just need to uh  So I mean it 's interesting that h going to a different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much ,  and going to a different language um  It doesn't seem to matter  The difference between three and four is not particularly great ,  so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal .  It sounds like um uh we may need to have more of uh things that are similar to a target language  or I mean . You have the same number of parameters in the neural net ,  you haven't increased the size of the neural net ,  and maybe there 's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set .  That that could be .  Um So , what about  So these are results with uh th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  I have a suggestion , actually ,  even though it 'll delay us slightly ,  would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ?  Cuz we 're all sort of  If we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , I think it 'd be  uh Uh , I 'll I 'll sing a song or dance or something while you do it , too .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh , this way and just slightly to the left ,  yeah .  Um .  That 's what he was saying .  Right .  Yeah .  But but i it sounds like  I mean . That 's interesting  because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of English ,  because in the other case you don't get hurt any more ,  at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse ,  but you have the same number of parameters representing it .  Well , it 's it sounds I mean , we have to be careful ,  cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet .  And comparing different bad results can be tricky .  But I I I I think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech .  It 's it 's  um But we did  Oh yeah ,  the other thing I was asking him , though , is that I think that in the case  Yeah ,  you you do have to be careful  because of com compounded results .  I think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another  and you didn't have three , but you just had one language .  So you trained on one type of digits and tested on another .  Didn - Wasn't there something of that ?  Where you , say , trained on Spanish and tested on on TI - digits ,  or the other way around ?  Something like that ?  I thought there was something like that , that he showed me last week .  We 'll have to wait till  we get  Um , This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane ,  but but , um , wasn't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ?  I mean no no mixture but just  We 've never just trained on one lang  Yeah .  But we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language .  Right ?  I mean , you haven't you haven't done all your tests on multiple languages .  See , I thought you showed me something like that last week .  You had a you had a little  Um What  So , I mean wha what 's the  This this chart this table that we 're looking at is um , show is all testing for TI - digits ,  or ?  Yeah .  Hmm .  Well , What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed  Do you remember ?  Wh - when you showed me the your table last week ?  So this is word word error rate ,  so a high number is bad .  OK , so if we take  uh um  let 's see  PLP uh with on - line normalization and delta - del  so that 's this thing you have circled here in the second column ,  um and "" multi - English "" refers to what ?  Right .  So w w So , I 'm sorry . I missed that .  What 's MF , MS and ME ?  Uh OK .  So , it 's uh broader vocabulary .  Then And  OK  so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages  and it and I was seeing that it got worse .  I I think that was all it was .  You had some very limited results that at that point  which showed having in these these other languages .  In fact it might have been just this last category , having two languages broad that were where where English was removed .  So that was cross language  ",,
Bro004.B,"and the and the result was quite poor .  What I we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English , it 's still poor .  Uh Um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data  Well , I think this is what you were explaining .  The noise condition is the same  It 's the same  uh Aurora noises uh , in all these cases for the training .  So there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test  and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect  Right .  So there 's some kind of a a an effect from having these uh this broader coverage  um  Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try testing these on u this same sort of thing  on  you probably must have this lined up to do .  To try the same t with the exact same training , do testing on the other languages .  On on um  So . Um ,  oh I well , wait a minute .  You have this here , for the Italian .  That 's right .  OK ,  so , So .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I mean , let 's see .  Is there any difference in  So it 's in the uh  So you 're saying that when you train on English and uh and and test on  No , you don't have training on English testing  In in what ?  And the noise is different in th  Do we have any um test sets uh in any other language that um have the same noise as in the Aurora ?  OK ?  Um So uh ,  I think this will take some looking at , thinking about .  But , what is uh what is currently running , that 's uh , i that just filling in the holes here  or or ? pretty much ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line .  Uh . Yeah .  Yes .  Yes .  So , do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization , or ?  Uh  Yes .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  OK .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Right .  Right .  OK , but I think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially , we wanna draw some conclusions from this ,  do some reductions in what we 're looking at ,  and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week .  So do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this ,  or ?  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  I di  It 's a trade - off ,  right ?  Any - anyway go ahead .  Maybe .  I mean , I I think you could make the same argument ,  it 'd be just as legitimate , for hybrid systems as well .  Right .  And in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions .  Right ?  Yeah .  Yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is  you 're ignoring  you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features ,  you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh , things that vary w over context .  Uh , and you 're putting it all together ,  ignoring the differences in context .  That that 's true for the hybrid system ,  it 's true for a tandem system .  So , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores .  OK ?  But I it 's it 's a big deal to get that .  I I 'm I 'm sort of  And once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language .  So um Uh , the the acoustics associated with uh a particular context ,  for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other ,  so the qu  the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder .  We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data  um  Right .  Almost .  But I mean it it it does give a distribution .  It 's and and it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar , that uh the i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other , too .  Oh no ,  but it would still be even more of a binary decision .  It it 'd be even more of one .  Because then you would say that in that this phone in this context is a one , but the same phone in a slightly different context is a zero .  That would be even even more distinct of a binary decision .  I actually would have thought you 'd wanna go the other way and have fewer classes .  Uh , I mean for instance , the the thing I was arguing for before , but again which I don't think we have time to try , is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features  cuz then that would that would go that would be much broader and cover many different situations .  ","Uh Um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data  The noise condition is the same  So there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test  OK , but I think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially , we wanna draw some conclusions from this ,  and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week .

Bro004.B,"But if you go to very very fine categories , it 's very binary .  Mm - hmm .  True .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well it 's  it 's it 's an interesting thought .  I mean we we could disagree about it at length  but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it  and and we 'll see .  But but what I 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is uh , you know ,  what do we do in four or five days ?  Uh , and so we have to be concerned with  Are we gonna look at any combinations of things ,  you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it .  Um , are we going to look at multi - band ?  Are we gonna look at combinations of things ?  Uh , what questions are we gonna ask ,  uh now that ,  I mean , we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note .  Um , how are we going to combine with what they 've been focusing on ?  Uh , Uh we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing .  And they , although they don't talk about it in this note ,  um , there 's um , the issue of the um Mu law business uh versus the logarithm ,  um , so .  So what i what is going on right now ?  What 's  right  you 've got nets retraining ,  Are there is there are there any H T K trainings testings going on ?  The combination ,  I see .  MSG and and PLP .  And is this with the revised on - line normalization ?  Old one .  So it 's using all the nets for that  but again we have the hope that it We have the hope that it maybe it 's not making too much difference ,  but but  yeah .  Uh , OK .  So what you do  um I just wanna understand  so You have two net or three nets ?  Was this ?  How many how many nets do you have ?  No nets .  Right .  But but I didn't understand  Uh . the software currently just has uh a allows for I think , the one one hot output .  So you 're having multiple nets and combining them ,  or ?  Uh , how are you how are you coming up with  If you say uh If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you  Oh , it 's just one net .  I see .  I see , OK .  So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago  instead of  yeah .  Uh - huh .  But you think if you include that plus the other features ,  So so again then we have these broad classes  and well , somewhat broad .  I mean , it 's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four , basically .  And you have the original features .  Which are PLP , or something .  And then uh , just to remind me , all of that goes into uh , that all of that is transformed by uh , uh , K - KL or something , or ?  Right .  Well no ,  I think  I see .  So there 's a question of whether you would  Right .  Whether you would transform together or just one .  Yeah .  Might wanna try it both ways .  But that 's interesting .  So that 's something that you 're you haven't trained yet but are preparing to train , and  Yeah .  Um Yeah ,  so I think Hynek will be here Monday .  Monday or Tuesday .  So  So I think , you know , we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully ,  so we can get uh key key questions answered uh before then  and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace ,  uh uh , it 's it 's really time to time to choose .  Um , let me pass this out , by the way .  Um These are  Did did did I interrupt you ?  Were there other things that you wanted to  Ah ! OK . OK , we have lots of them .  OK , so um , Something I asked  So they 're they 're doing the the VAD  I guess they mean voice activity detection So again , it 's the silence  So they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs , I believe .  Um I asked uh Hynek whether  I haven't talked to Sunil  I asked Hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities .  Uh . To get the speech voice activity detection , or else just using the silence , if there 's only one silence output .  Um And , he didn't think they had ,  um . But on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net  and maybe sometimes you don't run the other ,  maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway .  So um Their uh the results look pretty good .  Um , I mean , not uniformly .  I mean , there 's a an example or two that you can find , where it made it slightly worse , but uh in in all but a couple examples .  Uh .  I I 'm sorry .  I don't understand your question .  It 's on training .  No .  Yes .  Yes , I don't know .  That 's that 's so that 's a that 's a very good question ,  ","I mean we we could disagree about it at length  but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it  and and we 'll see .

Bro004.B,"then now that it I understand it . It 's  "" yeah ,  where does the LDA come from ? ""  In the In earlier experiments , they had taken LDA from a completely different database ,  right ?  So that 's a good question .  Where does it come from ?  Yeah , I don't know .  Um , but uh to tell you the truth , I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it  I was mostly thinking about the the VAD .  And um , it ap it ap  Oh what does what does ASP ?  Oh that 's  It says "" baseline ASP "" .  Anybody know any  Um Cuz there 's "" baseline Aurora "" above it .  And it 's This is mostly better than baseline ,  although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases .  Yeah , it says what it is .  But I don't how that 's different from  I think this was I think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in Oregon .  Oh . OK .  Shouldn't it be  Yeah . So so what they 're doing here is , i  if you look down at the block diagram , um , they estimate they get a they get an estimate of whether it 's speech or silence ,  and then they have a median filter of it .  And so um , basically they 're trying to find stretches .  The median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity .  You find stretches where the combination of the frame wise VAD and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence .  And then it 's going through and just throwing the data away .  Right ?  So um  It 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah .  There 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gonna be single cases of frames , or isolated frames .  So it 's throwing out frames  and the thing is um , what I don't understand is how they 're doing this with H T  This is  Yeah .  Well , you you can ,  right ?  I mean y you you  it stretches again .  For single frames I think it would be pretty hard .  But if you say speech starts here , speech ends there .  Right ?  Yeah .  Yeah , so I mean in the i i in the in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here .  I think they 're they 're they 're treating it , you know , like uh  well , it 's not isolated word ,  but but connected ,  you know , the the  Well . No they they have numbers though ,  right ?  So I think they 're they 're doing something like that .  I think that they 're they 're  I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard .  In other words , it 's uh  I mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway .  Um .  But it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's I I  Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice , uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot .  Right ?  And so um  It does introduce delays  but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it .  And the LDA introduces delays ,  and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path  so that it doesn't introduce uh , any more delay .  I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay  but at the same time the LDA down here  I don't know Wh  what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ?  Ah , thank you .  Yeah , you would know that .  So um . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same  so that I think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way  and then it 'd be OK .  They they clearly did actually remove silent sections  in order because they got these word error rate results .  So um I think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this  because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result  and therefore will help within an evaluation .  Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , I don't know .  Um . Uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad  and nobody wants has has approached improving them .  So it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with .  So this might just be a temporary thing .  But But , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea .  So um The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been  if you look at what we 've been trying ,  we 're uh looking at uh ,  by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band  Uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues .  And they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues .

Bro004.B,"But they 've been looking at uh at these issues .  At the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection .  And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at  And once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ?  Uh , because we still have even once we choose , we 've still got uh another month or so ,  I mean there 's holidays in the way , but but uh I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first  so there 's still a fair amount of time to do things together  it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time .  Well , see they ,  I I think they 're  Um . I don't know the the specifics of how they 're doing it .  They 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um , change the scripts for the recognizer , I believe .  So .  Uh . Uh , you know that 's what I had thought .  But I don't I don't think they are .  I mean that 's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side ,  yeah  you p put some low level noise or something .  Probably don't want all zeros .  Most recognizers don't like zeros  but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand  sorry  epsilon random variable in or something .  Maybe not a constant but it doesn't , uh don't like to divide by the variance of that ,  but I mean it 's  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So I I that 's what I thought they would do .  or else , uh uh maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop ,  I don't know .  But whatever they did , I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation .  We c we can find out .  No they 're  It would do badly  and it didn't so badly ,  right ?  So they did something .  Yeah .  Uh . So , OK ,  So I think this brings me up to date a bit .  It hopefully brings other people up to date a bit .  And um Um I think Uh , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit  and think about it and and talk with everybody uh , outside of this meeting .  Um , but uh  No I mean it sounds like I mean there there there are the usual number of of little little problems and bugs and so forth  but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out .  And now we 're seem to be kind of in a position to actually uh , look at stuff and and and compare things .  So I think that 's that 's pretty good .  Um I don't know what the  One of the things I wonder about , coming back to the first results you talked about , is is how much , uh things could be helped by more parameters .  And uh And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have , in terms of the uh computational limits .  Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters ,  particularly when it 's twice as much data and it 's quite diverse ,  um , I wonder if having twice as many parameters would help .  Uh , just have a bigger hidden layer .  Uh But  I doubt it would help by forty per cent .  But but uh  Just curious .  How are we doing on the resources ?  Disk , and  OK .  Computation ?  We  Yeah .  Yeah , well .  Are were you folks using Gin ?  That 's a that just died ,  you know ?  No ?  Oh , that 's good .  OK .  Yeah , we 're gonna get a replacement server that 'll be a faster server , actually .  That 'll be It 's a seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN  uh But it won't be installed for a little while .  U Go ahead .  We have the little tiny IBM machine that might someday grow up to be a big IBM machine .  It 's got s slots for eight ,  uh IBM was donating five ,  I think we only got two so far ,  processors .  We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors .  They ended up being five fifty .  So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz .  And more are supposed to come soon  and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory .  So I don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it ,  but uh Hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon  and  Uh , yeah , I think that 'll be  once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine .  I mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there .  And uh and uh a nice amount of memory .  Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .

If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything  running through these a hundred times faster  because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings ,  right ?  But if the HTK  I mean I think they 're both It sounded like they were roughly equal ?  Is that about right ?  Yeah .  Uh , probably the neural net  cuz it 's probably it it 's it 's um  Well , I I don't know .  They both  HTK we use for um this Aurora stuff  Um Um , I think It 's not clear yet what we 're gonna use for trainings  uh  Well , there 's the trainings  uh is it the training that takes the time , or the decoding ?

But you could split up the sentences in a test set .  Yeah ?  Aha !  I see .  Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than this Aurora stuff , uh what do we do , large vocabulary training slash testing for uh tandem systems .

Bro004.D,"Channel channel three ,  yeah .  OK .  Mike four .  Uh so . uh We So As I was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features .  The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora .  Uh , and we focused for the the test part on the English and the Italian .  Um . We 've trained uh several neural networks on  so on the TI - digits English and on the Italian data  and also on the broad uh English uh French and uh Spanish databases .  Mmm , so there 's our result tables here , for the tandem approach ,  and um , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well .  Yeah ,  so if the network is trained on the task data um tandem works pretty well .  And uh actually we have uh ,  results are similar Only on ,  yeah .  Just that task .  But actually we didn't train network on uh both types of data  I mean uh phonetically ba  phonetically balanced uh data and task data .  We only did either task task data or uh broad data .  Um Yeah .  So ,  Mmm . Yeah .  If we use the same language ?  Mm - hmm .  But Yeah but I did not uh do that .  We No , we did four four kind of of testing , actually .  The first testing is with task data  So , with nets trained on task data .  So for Italian on the Italian speech @ @ .  The second test is trained on a single language um with broad database ,  but the same language as the t task data .  But for Italian we choose Spanish which we assume is close to Italian .  The third test is by using , um the three language database  and the fourth is  This includes  Yeah .  But not digits .  I mean it 's  Yeah  And the fourth test is uh excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language .  Yeah .  Uh , yeah .  So um for uh TI - digits for ins  example uh when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training uh we lose uh around ten percent ,  uh . The error rate increase u of of of ten percent , relative .  So this is not so bad .  And then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse  and , well Around uh , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further .  So .  Yeah .  Twenty to to thirty percent further .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . Yeah .  But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from  So .  And we lose  Yeah .  Uh So , basically when it 's trained on the the multilingual broad data um or number  so ,  the the ratio of  our error rates uh with the baseline error rate is around uh one point one .  So .  No no no .  Uh same language we are at uh for at English at O point eight .  So it improves , compared to the baseline .  But  So .  Le - let me .  Tas - task data  we are u  Yeah .  Mmm .  Hmm .  Oh yeah , the f Yeah , OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Sure .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , it 's around one point one .  Yeah .  Ye  Uh , more actually .  If I Yeah .  What would you say ?  Around one point four  yeah .  If we exclude English , um there is not much difference with the data  with English .  So . Yeah .  Uh .  Hmm .  Yeah .  The only difference it 's is that it 's multilingual  Um  Yeah .  Yeah sure .  Uh yeah .  A part of it ,  yeah .  Um It 's two times ,  actually ?  Yeah .  Um . The English data No , the multilingual databases are two times the broad English data .  We just wanted to keep this , w well , not too huge .  So .  I think so .  Do you  Uh , Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Hmm ?  Mmm .  Uh , let me check .  Uh .  So . This was for the PLP ,  Um . The  Yeah .  For the PLP with JRASTA the the we  This is quite the same tendency , with a slight increase of the error rate , uh if we go to to TIMIT .  And then it 's it gets worse with the multilingual .  Um . Yeah .  There there is a difference actually with b between PLP and JRASTA  is that JRASTA seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition .  Mmm .  Yeah , yeah .  OK .  Uh , no , no .  Training on a single language , you mean ,  and testing on the other one ?  Uh , no .  So the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages ,  and that  Uh , No .  Either thi this is test with uh the same language but from the broad data ,  or it 's test with uh different languages  also from the broad data ,  excluding the  So , it 's it 's three or three and four .  Uh . No .  You mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ?  No .  Uh , No , I don't think so .  So .  So you have uh basically two uh parts .  ","Uh so . uh We So As I was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features .  The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora .  Uh , and we focused for the the test part on the English and the Italian .  Um . We 've trained uh several neural networks on  so on the TI - digits English and on the Italian data  and also on the broad uh English uh French and uh Spanish databases .  and um , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well .  But actually we didn't train network on uh both types of data  We only did either task task data or uh broad data .  The first testing is with task data  The second test is trained on a single language um with broad database ,  but the same language as the t task data .  But for Italian we choose Spanish which we assume is close to Italian .  The third test is by using , um the three language database  Yeah .  And the fourth test is uh excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language .  example uh when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training uh we lose uh around ten percent ,  uh . The error rate increase u of of of ten percent , relative .  And then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse  Twenty to to thirty percent further .  So . This was for the PLP ,  For the PLP with JRASTA the the we  This is quite the same tendency , with a slight increase of the error rate , uh if we go to to TIMIT .  And then it 's it gets worse with the multilingual .  There there is a difference actually with b between PLP and JRASTA  is that JRASTA seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition .  ","The meeting was dominated by a discussion of the first results coming
in. The process
and results were explained to the group, the implications of the
results discussed, and plans for moving forward were made. There have been four types of test, in which the training data
varies, and a variety of input features have been tried. "
Bro004.D,"The upper part is for TI - digits  and it 's divided in three rows of four four rows each .  And the first four rows is well - matched ,  then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched ,  and finally highly mismatched .  And then the lower part is for Italian  and it 's the same the same thing .  So . It 's it 's the HTK results , I mean .  So it 's HTK training testings with different kind of features  and what appears in the uh left column is the networks that are used for doing this .  So . Uh Yeah .  It - It was part of these results .  Mmm .  Mmm .  You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ?  It 's uh the one hundred number .  It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline .  Yeah , this is a word error rate ratio .  Yeah .  So , seventy point two means that we reduced the error rate uh by thirty thirty percent .  So .  Hmm .  Yeah .  To TIMIT .  Mmm .  Then you have uh MF , MS and ME  which are for French , Spanish and English .  And ,  yeah .  Actually I I uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives  uh but with increased frame numbers .  Mmm .  And we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we don't use  delta but it 's not not that much .  So . Multi - French , Multi - Spanish , and Multi - English .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Still poor .  Yeah . Yeah .  No these are the s s s same noises ,  yeah .  At least at least for the first for the well - matched ,  yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , so for the Italian the results are uh stranger  um Mmm .  So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is not very close to Italian  because uh , well , when using the the network trained only on Spanish it 's the error rate is almost uh twice the baseline error rate .  Mmm . Uh .  Yeah .  There there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different .  Well , For for the Italian part I mean  the uh the um networks are trained with noise from Aurora TI - digits ,  mmm .  Yeah .  And perhaps the noise are quite different from the noises in the speech that Italian .  And  No .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's  no ,  the third part ,  so it 's uh highly mismatched .  So . Training and test noise are different .  Yeah .  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah . But it 's not a clean case .  It 's a noisy case  but uh training and test noises are the same .  So Yeah .  Yeah .  So it 's always noisy basically ,  and , well , the  Mmm .  Uh , no we don't plan to fill the holes  but actually there is something important ,  is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization  and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to HTK .  Um Mmm .  So basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first uh row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five ,  these are the results we obtained for Italian uh with straight mmm , PLP features using on - line normalization .  Mmm . And the , mmm what 's in the table , just at the left of the PLP twelve on - line normalization column ,  so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and uh forty - two are the results obtained by uh Pratibha with uh his on - line normalization uh her on - line normalization approach .  So .  Just uh  Yeah .  So these are the results of OGI with on - line normalization  and straight features to HTK .  And the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to HTK .  So what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct ,  but still the networks are very good .  When we use the networks our number are better that uh Pratibha results .  Yeah .  There were diff there were different things  and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value .  So , the recursion uh part .  um , I used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here .  And Pratibha used five percent .  So it adapts more quickly  Um , but ,  yeah .  I assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from Dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results .  It was true on uh TI - digits but it 's not true on Italian .  Uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff .  Actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance .  And using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database .  And Pratibha did something different is  that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance .  Mmm . There were other minor differences ,  ","No these are the s s s same noises ,  At least at least for the first for the well - matched ,  Yeah , so for the Italian the results are uh stranger  So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is not very close to Italian  because uh , well , when using the the network trained only on Spanish it 's the error rate is almost uh twice the baseline error rate .

There were other minor differences ,  ",
Bro004.D,"the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen ,  and that she used C - zero instead of log energy .  Uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion .  So . Uh , I changed the code  uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the OGI baseline .  We It it 's slightly uh different  because I don't exactly initialize the same way she does .  Actually I start , mmm , I don't wait to a fifteen twenty - five twenty - five frames before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion .  I I use the on - line scheme  and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five twenty - fifth frame .  But , well it 's similar .  So uh I retrained the networks with these  well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features .  And ,  yeah .  So basically what I expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down  but perhaps not not so much  because I think the neural networks learn perhaps to  even if the features are not normalized . It it will learn how to normalize  and  Yeah .  Yeah I  No ,  I we plan to start this  uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these  what we could do more as a as a research  and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not  Uh , well , there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff  because we trained the networks  If we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task ,  um , what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space .  And uh mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary  and one for another phoneme at the other side .  And so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct  because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place .  But the way the feature gives The the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data  but this is not the case for another kind of data .  So  Yeah .  So uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks .  Doing something like , um um phonemes within context and ,  well , basically context dependent phonemes .  Yeah but , we know that  Ye - yeah but here it 's something different .  We want to have features  uh well , um .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , but mmm , I mean , the  the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network  and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions .  And uh binary decisions about phonemes .  Nnn Uh It 's  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , sure  but  uh So basically it 's almost binary decisions  and um the idea of using more classes is to get something that 's less binary decisions .  But yeah , but  Yeah , but if  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah , but I think  Yeah , perhaps you 're right ,  but you have more classes  so you you have more information in your features .  So , Um You have more information in the uh  posteriors vector  um  which means that  But still the information is relevant  because it 's it 's information that helps to discriminate ,  if it 's possible to be able to discriminate among the phonemes in context .  But the  Mmm .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  N  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh so there is this combination ,  yeah .  Working on combination obviously .  Um , I will start work on multi - band .  And we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs .  Um . And we think that with this approach perhaps we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network .  Um , So , get simpler networks ,  because we still have the features .  So we have um come up with um different kind of broad phonetic categories .  And we have Basically we have three types of broad phonetic classes .  Well , something using place of articulation  which which leads to nine , I think , broad classes .  Uh , another which is based on manner ,  which is is also something like nine classes .  And then , something that combine both ,  and we have twenty f twenty - five ?  Twenty - seven broad classes .  So like , uh ,  oh , I don't know ,  like back vowels , front vowels .  Um For the moments we do not don't have nets ,  I mean , It 's just Were we just changing the labels to retrain nets with fewer out outputs .  And then  Mm - hmm .  It - It 's the single net ,  yeah .  It 's one net with um twenty - seven outputs  if we have twenty - seven classes ,  yeah .  So it 's Well , it 's basically a standard net with fewer classes .  Yeah ,  but I think  Yeah .  ","So . Uh , I changed the code  uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the OGI baseline .  well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features .  uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these  and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not  If we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task ,  um , what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space .

Bro004.D,"B b including the features , yeah .  I don't think this will work alone .  I think it will get worse  because Well , I believe the effect that of of too reducing too much the information is basically basically what happens  and  but  Yeah ,  because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings ,  and OGI show showed that , is the distinction between sp speech and silence  Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition .  I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech , and we add noise after .  So this is one thing  And  But perhaps , something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information .  Uh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  There will probably be ,  yeah ,  one single KL to transform everything  or uh ,  per  This is still something that  yeah ,  we don't know  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Uh , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .

I think I think it 's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy .  Yeah , it 's this .  It should be that ,  yeah .  Because  Yeah .  i  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files .  I t  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I think we 're alright ,  um , not much problems with that .  It 's OK .

Bro005.A,"Mike . Mike - one ?  Yeah ,  um .  Yeah .  Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table ,  but as it grows in size , uh , it .  Uh , yeah .  Yeah .  So  Next time we will put colors or something .  Uh .  OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done  It 's this .  Summary of experiments since , well , since last week  and also since the we 've started to run work on this .  Um . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization  but with delta also ,  because the column was not completely  well , it 's still not completely filled ,  but we have more results to compare with network using without PLP  and finally , hhh , um ehhh PL - uh delta seems very important .  Uh I don't know .  If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B ,  so , the next t the second , uh , part of the table ,  uh when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta  and eighty - nine with the delta .  Yeah ,  on the baseline , yeah .  So  Yeah . Yeah .  So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much uh uh much smaller  um  But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages .  And  Mmm , Yeah .  And f also for Italian , actually .  If you take the second set of experiment for Italian ,  so , the mismatched condition ,  um when we use the training on TIMIT  so , it 's multi - English ,  we have a ninety - one number ,  and training with other languages is a little bit worse .  So ,  yeah .  And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta .  If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's we have one hundred and seventy - two ,  and one hundred and four when we use delta .  Uh . Even if the contexts used is quite the same ,  because without delta we use seventeenths seventeen frames .  Uh .  Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week .  Uh , so this is training the net on French only ,  or on English only ,  and testing on Italian .  And training the net on French only  and Spanish only  and testing on , uh TI - digits .  And ,  fff um ,  yeah .  What we see is that these nets are not as good ,  except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best .  Yeah ,  then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from uh English digits , and from Italian digits .  So this is the another line another set of lines in the table .  Uh , @ @ with SPINE  and uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data ,  uh , so we have to to redo the uh the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta .  But  um this this net performed quite well .  Well ,  it 's it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only .  Uh .  So ,  uh , yeah .  We have also started feature combination experiments .  Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together .  And this is The results are on the other document .  Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps well , just , @ @ .  Yeah , so basically there are four four kind of systems .  The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using  and each feature stream has its own MPL .  So it 's the kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first .  The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal .  The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs .  And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs .  Um ,  yeah .  Mmm .  You know you can you can comment these results ,  Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy .  So it 's not the Again we switch to another  So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this .  Um .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table ,  the huge table ,  um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP ,  but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP .  So , um uh , well , I don't think this is a bug  but this this is something in probably in the MSG um process that  uh  I don't know what exactly .  Perhaps the fact that the the there 's no low - pass filter ,  well ,  or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter  and that there is some DC offset in the Italian ,  or , well ,  something simple like that .

Bro005.A,"But that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG  because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information .  And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP .  Yeah .  Uh yeah ,  so this is basically this is in the table .  Uh so the number is fifty - two ,  uh  Fift - So No , it 's it 's the  Of of of uh eighteen  of eighteen .  So it 's it 's error rate , basically .  It 's er error rate ratio .  So  Uh , so we have nine nine let 's say ninety percent .  Yeah .  Um which is uh what we have also if use PLP and MSG together ,  eighty - nine point seven .  Uh .  P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same same results .  Well , we have these results .  I don't know .  It 's not  Do you have this result with PLP alone , j fee feeding HTK ?  That That 's what you mean ?  Just PLP at the input of HTK .  Yeah .  So , PLP  Yeah .  Um  Yeah , that 's without the neural net  and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization .  This is the w well , but this is without on - line normalization .  Yeah .  Eighty - two is the it 's the Aurora baseline ,  so MFCC .  Then we can use  well , OGI , they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization  Yeah , sorry .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent .  Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same .  We j jump to ninety percent .  And And um  whatever the normalization , actually .  If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent .

Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net  and straight features with delta - delta .  And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet .  It 's eight eighty - eight point six .  Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration .  So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features .  So yeah ,  this is not perhaps not clear here  but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features .  So , just  Yeah  so , actually it it it decreased the the accuracy .  Because we have eighty - eight point six .  And even the MLP alone  What gives the MLP alone ?  Multi - English PLP .  Oh no ,  it gives eighty - three point six .  So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six ,  that gives eighty - seven point one .  Eighty - three point six .  Eighty  Is th is that right ?  Yeah ?  Perhaps , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mmm .  On TI - digits ?  OK .  No , not yet .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So , it 's slightly better ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , so perhaps let 's let 's jump at the last experiment .  It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output .  It 's again better .  So it 's eighty - nine point point one .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , yeah .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Scale  Yeah .  But  Is it i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances ,  so I d Is it  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Yeah . Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , and test across everything .  Mmm .  Yeah .  So , the next point ,  yeah ,  we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn ,  um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff ,  um .  So we 'll perhaps start something next week .  Um , discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our our networks with their within their block diagram ,  uh , where to plug in the the network , uh , after the the feature ,  before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path ,  discussion about multi - band and TRAPS ,  um ,  actually Hynek would like to see ,  perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band .  ","But that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG  because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information .  so this is basically this is in the table .  Uh so the number is fifty - two ,  Fift - So No , it 's it 's the  Of of of uh eighteen  of eighteen .  So it 's it 's error rate , basically .  It 's er error rate ratio .

Bro005.A,"And he would like to replace these by a network  which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP .  Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system .  Basically , this is a TRAP system  kind of TRAP system , I mean ,  but where the neural network are replaced by LDA .  Hmm . Um , yeah ,  and about multi - band ,  uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings ,  um  mmh Actually , I w I w hhh prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium .  So I take exactly the same configurations ,  seven bands with nine frames of context ,  and we just train on TIMIT ,  and on the large database ,  so , with SPINE and everything .  And ,  mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts .  So , this would would be something between TRAPS and multi - band  because we still have quite large bands ,  and but with a lot of context also .  So Um  Yeah ,  we still have to work on Finnish ,  um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages .  For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything .  So . Now we can test these two networks on with with delta and large networks .  Well , test them also on Finnish  and see which one is the the the best .  Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what everything that has been done .  So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on  one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven  ten on ten different databases .  Uh ,  the number of frames is bad also ,  so we have one million and a half for some ,  three million for other ,  and six million for the last one .  Uh ,  yeah ! As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled ,  and perhaps this is what makes the difference .  Um .  Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned .  So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things .  First , um with respect to the on - line normalization ,  there are that use bad on - line normalization ,  and other good on - line normalization .  Um .  With respect to the features ,  with respect to the use of delta  or no ,  uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets .  Uh , but of course we don't have all the combination of these different parameters  Um .  s What 's this ?  We only have two hundred eighty six different tests  And no not two thousand .  Yeah .  Um .  Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already .  The MSG problem ,  um ,  the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate .  but when the M - MLP is trained on the um is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features .  Except if the features are bad  uh , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized .  In this case the tandem is still better  even if it 's trained on not on the target digits .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh , so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I don't know at all  but I 've perhaps I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite quite simple  or just like nnn , no high - pass filter  or Mmm .  Yeah . My But I don't know .  It 's There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC .  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Um .  Yeah , but  Yeah .  But this was the bad on - line normalization . Actually .  Uh . Are your results are still with the bad the bad  With the O - OLN - two ?  Ah yeah , you have you have OLN - two ,  yeah .  So it 's , is the good yeah .  And  Yeah .  Mmm .  But  Yeah .  Mmm .  I see ,  yeah .  And  Mmm .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Um .  Yeah . So , the the reason Yeah , the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency , and the noise dependency  Well , the e e But this is still not clear  because ,  um ,  I I I don't think we have enough result to talk about the the language dependency .  Well , the TIMIT network is still the best  but there is also an the other difference ,  the fact that it 's it 's hand - labeled .  We still have uh this  One of these perhaps ?  Mm - hmm .  Uh , mmm , uh , I mean , that the the fact that s Well , for for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net .  But the other are slightly worse .  But you have two two effects , the effect of changing language  and the effect of training on something that 's Viterbi - aligned instead of hand hand - labeled .  So . Um .  Yeah .  Mmm .

Bro005.A,"Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . But Yeah . But , perhaps it 's not really the the alignment that 's bad  but the just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment  Mmm .  I mean for We  It 's single pronunciation ,  uh  French French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually  so we asked people to listen to the um the sentence  and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them .  But still ,  there there might be errors just in the in in the ph string of phonemes .  Mmm .  Um .  Yeah , so this is not really the Viterbi alignment ,  in fact ,  yeah .  Um , the third The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps  but , well , this is not clear yet  because all our nets are trained on the same noises  and  Yeah .  So  Yeah .  But  Yeah .  Results are only coming for for this net .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Um .  So . Uh , from these results we have some questions with answers .  What should be the network input ?  Um , PLP work as well as MFCC , I mean .  Um .  But it seems impor important to use the delta .  Uh , with respect to the network size ,  there 's one experiment that 's still running  and we should have the result today ,  comparing network with five hundred and one thousand units .  So ,  nnn , still no answer actually .  Uh , the training set ,  well , some kind of answer .  We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result ,  but we don't know exactly why .

So Yeah , the training targets actually ,  the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency .  And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets .  And labeling s labeling seems important  uh , because of TIMIT results .  Uh .  For moment you use we use phonetic targets  but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets ,  and perhaps even , um use networks that doesn't do classification  but just regression  so uh , train to have neural networks that  um , um , uh ,  does a regression  and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . I mean uh , transform the fea noisy features in other features that are not noisy .  But continuous features .  Not uh uh , hard targets .  Uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  f But , yeah .  So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this this could be could help could help perhaps to reduce language dependency  and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach .  So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database .  I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network ,  and So this is one approach  and the other is multi - band uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes .  So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could could could help .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So ,  um , yeah .

And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling  Um .  Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the to their diagram .  Cuz  Yeah .  Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange  because nnn , they they make LDA  and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates ,  or ?  Mmm ?  Mmm .  And and and  yeah .  And because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help .  So . I don't know .  Um .  Yeah , the the way we want to do  The  d What ?  Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the VAD labels and the final features .

I  Um , the uh , baseline system  when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ?  That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing ,  and the training is Italian digits ?  So the "" mismatch "" just refers to the noise and and , uh microphone and so forth ,  right ?  So , um did we have  So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the uh Italian digits ?  The  Yes .  Yes .  Training of the net ,  yeah .  So , um So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP .  Now w would do we have a number , I suppose for the matched  I I don't mean matched ,  but uh use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only ?  Fifty - two percent .  No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ?  Oh this is accuracy !  Oy ! OK .  Ninety .  Yeah .  OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition  Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping .  Same result pretty much ?  So , s  Eighty - eight point six .  Um , so adding MSG  um Well , but that 's yeah , that 's without the neural net ,  right ?  But she had said eighty - two .  Right ?  Oh , this the eighty - two .  Oh , I 'm sorry ,  I k I keep getting confused  because this is accuracy .  OK . Alright .  Alright . So this is I was thinking all this was worse .  OK so this is all better  because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two .  OK .  I 'm I 'm all better now .  OK , go ahead .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety , or something .  Eighty - nine .  And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically .  Yeah . OK .  For this case , right ?  Alright .  So , um So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you uh does not help in that case .  Um  The other ones , we 'd have to look at it ,  but  And the multi - English , does  uh  So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly .  Um and we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net .  And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things .  And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error .  Uh no , not quite that ,  is it .  Uh , two point six out of eighteen .  About , um sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition .  Not matching condition ,  but uh , the uh , Italian training .  OK .  Yes , good .  OK ?  So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use  since you 're not gonna have matching , uh , data for the uh for the new for the other languages and so forth .  Um , one qu thing is that ,  uh I think I asked you this before ,  but I wanna double check .  When you say "" ME "" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English ,  but it is not all of the multi - English ,  right ?  It is some piece of part of it .

So the "" mismatch "" just refers to the noise and and , uh microphone and so forth ,  So , um So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP .  Now w would do we have a number , I suppose for the matched  I I don't mean matched ,  but uh use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only ?  Fifty - two percent .  No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ?  Oh this is accuracy !  Oh , I 'm sorry ,  I k I keep getting confused  because this is accuracy .  And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically .  So , um So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you uh does not help in that case .  So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use  since you 're not gonna have matching , uh , data for the uh for the new for the other languages and so forth .

Bro005.D,"So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish .  I wonder why  Yeah . Uh .  Hmm .  It 's still  OK .  Alright , go ahead .  And then then  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other  cuz this is , uh with multi - English , uh , training .  So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box ,  which is that , uh the eighty - four point six .  Right ?  So  Yeah .  Yeah .  Not t not  tr No . No . No .  Not trained with multi - English .  Eh . Oh , I see .  Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , "" What what has adding the MLP done to improve over the ,  uh  Yes .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Eighty - s  I thought it was eighty  Oh , OK ,  eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six .  OK .  Well , that 's that 's one thing ,  but see the other thing is that ,  um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case ,  but let 's let 's consider what that means .  What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that  I mean my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation .  When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training .  When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems .  And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad .  So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh on say digits ,  you know ,  d Was that experiment done ?  Yeah , OK .  Uh , then does that , eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , does it does it then look much better ?  And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh of tests ?  So , an anyway .  OK , go ahead .  Mm - hmm .  Slightly better .  And and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Um , by the way , there is a another , uh , suggestion that would apply , uh , to the second configuration ,  um , which , uh , was made , uh , by , uh , Hari .  And that was that , um , if you have uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances  if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale the streams .  Right ?  So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK ,  which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances  which would effectively change the scale of these these , uh , two streams that come in .  And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance .  And , um , so this is just setting them to be ,  excuse me ,  of equal equal weight .  Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight .  Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that ,  but but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition .  It 's not even the HTK ,  uh , uh  Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also .  Uh , do you ?  Let me think .  Maybe you don't .  Uh .  Yeah , you have to change the  No , you can just do it in as once you 've done the training  Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances  so I guess you could you could just scale them all .  Variances .  That 's uh , exactly the point , I think ,  that if you change um , change what they are  It 's diagonal covariance matrices ,  but you say what those variances are .  So , that you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna it 's gonna it 's gonna internally multiply it and and uh , uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's it 's gonna it 's it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the change the variances of some of the features .  So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features .  That was that was , uh , Hari 's suggestion .  So , um  Yeah .  So .  ","So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish .  I wonder why  What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that  I mean my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation .

Bro005.D,"So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do .  Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms  because , you know , maybe it should be a different number for for each kind of test set , or something ,  but  OK .  So I guess the other thing is to take you know if one were to take , uh , you know , a couple of the most successful of these ,  and uh  Yeah , try all these different tests .  Alright .  Uh .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Ugh ! I was impressed  boy ,  two thousand .  OK .  Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed ,  OK .  Yeah . So it sounds like yeah , the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization .  But if you can do good normalization it 's it 's uh OK .  So So - Let me bef before you go on to the possible issues .  So , on the MSG uh problem  um , I think that in in the um , in the short time solution  um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress ,  uh , much as I said with JRASTA ,  even though I really like JRASTA  and I really like MSG ,  I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it it may be complicated .  And uh it might be if someone 's interested in it , uh , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term ,  once we get out of this particular rush uh for results .  But in the short term , unless you have some some s strong idea of what 's wrong ,  Yeah , probably .  There 's supposed to well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though ,  right ?  Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be  uh ,  yeah ,  taking out means and variances and so forth .  So .  In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design ,  so it 's  "" On - line - two "" is good .  "" Two "" is good ?  No , "" two "" is bad .  OK .  Yeah .  So Yeah , I I agree .  It 's probably something simple  uh , i if if uh someone , you know , uh , wants to play with it for a little bit .  I mean , you 're gonna do what you 're gonna do  but but my my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find .  Yeah .  Uh . And the other the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is  uh  Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen .  That 's that what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task  If it 's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it .  If it uh if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance .  And the question is now how to how to get one and not the other ?  Or how to how to ameliorate the the problems .  Um , because it it certainly does is nice to have in there , when it when there is something like the training data .  So that 's what you say th there .  I see .  Hey !  Um , just you can just sit here .  Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones  but it 's uh  Just uh , have a seat .  Um .  s Summary of the first uh , uh forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and works , and some stuff doesn't  OK ,  Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that  but I think if you if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words  and then th that has it the associated results .  OK .  So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see ,  yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing .  But you 're saying that uh , it is Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about .  And and what is that ?  I mean , you say "" not clear yet "" .  What what do you mean ?  Mm - hmm .  Do you think the alignments are bad ?  I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ?  What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ?  Might be interesting to look at it .  Because , I mean , that is just looking  but um , um It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment .  It depends how good the recognizer is  that 's that the the engine is that 's doing the alignment .  Aha !  The pronunciation models and so forth  Aha .  I see .  I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth .

Bro005.D,"we have different different noises ,  Um If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them .  And put put them together .  What what What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean  I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones .  That you did have nice interpolative effects .  That is , that yes , if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results .  But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two .  So it was sort of behaved reasonably .  Is tha that a fair  Yeah .  It works better if what ?  I see .  Well , see , i oc  You were doing some something that was  So maybe the analogy isn't quite right .  You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved .  You had reverb for a single variable  which was re uh , uh , reverberation .  Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data .  But we have s f for this kind of task , I would think , sort of a modest amount .  I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much .  We have a modest amount of of uh training data from a couple different conditions ,  and then uh in yeah , that and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language ,  and noise type  uh , and uh , uh , channel characteristic ,  sort of all over the map .  A bunch of different dimensions .  And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have um , the data to train up  I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this ,  but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases  and uh the performance is getting worse  and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is is is is is better .  And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that .  But one way or another we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering .  So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that  um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making ,  which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I I just sort of have a feeling  Yeah .  I mean i i e The um I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA ,  which is a kind of LogRASTA ,  it 's just that they have the  I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall ,  and it 's it uh it 's just that they d it 's trained up ,  right ?  That that um benefitted from on - line normalization .  So they did At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary .  So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ?  I mean they they were not not using the neural net .  Uh I don't know .  OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single  Yeah .  Make stuff better .  OK .  Uh . Yeah .  And CPU memory issues .  Yeah .  We 've been sort of ignoring that ,  haven't we ?  But  Yeah , but I li  Well , I think My impression  You you folks have been looking at this more than me .  But my impression was that uh , there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay ,  but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better ,  and using less CPU was better .  Something like that ,  right ?  Um , well I don't think we 're um completely off the wall .  I mean I think that if we if we have  Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do  If we find  uh  I mean we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L  You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in .  If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP .  We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server .  And it 's  uh  We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that .  So , I I I think I think that 's that 's OK .

Bro005.D,"So I think the key thing was um , this plug into OGI .  Um ,  what what are they What are they gonna be working  Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features ,  and ?  OK .  So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get  There 'd be some point where you say , "" OK , this is their version - one "" or whatever ,  and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them ,  and then um , uh , that 's what we work with .  We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path  and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January  some point  uh , we say , "" OK we we have shown that we can improve this , in this way .  So now uh um what 's your newest version ? ""  And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better  and then we we 'd combine it .  This is always hard .  I mean I I I used to work with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh with a neural net system  and uh , it was a common problem that you 'd  Oh , and this Actually , this is true not just for neural nets  but just for in general if people were working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come came from uh , a mainstream recognizer .  Uh , You get something from the the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring .  But they 're working really hard , too .  So by the time you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score  and now there isn't any difference ,  because the other  So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to  uh Uh ,  I I don't know .  I think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases .  I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e  What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things ,  presumably uh , in a in a day we could turn around  uh , taking a new set of things from them and and rescoring it ,  right ?  So .  Yeah .  Well , OK .  No , this is I think this is good .  I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings .  You know , da training targets and noises and so forth .  That 's sort of wide open .  Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I I really liked MSG .  And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties .  And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties .  Um , but um , uh ,  we only have limited time  and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at .  And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set  and the training targets ,  and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing ,  and , you know , with limited time .  Yeah .  I think we have to start cutting down .  So uh  I think so ,  yeah .  And then , you know , once we  Um , having gone through this process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about  uh , that you 'd not getting to  and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most ,  you know , got you most interested  uh and uh and and work with it , you know , for the next round .  Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .  So .  So , there 'll still be plenty to do .

Um those features go through a contextualized KLT .  Then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered  Sure .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , that 's good .  So  Yeah .  Three , OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Aha !  aha !  Yeah ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  No , the KLT .  And those two together .  That 's it .  OK so that 's that 's this bottom one .  And so uh and then the the the one at the top  and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they 're the best ?  Oh let 's focus on them then  so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Do you e um they mentioned made some uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .  Um and we don't have the TI - digits part yet ?  OK .  OK .  And so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ?  I mean not  OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good  then we could compare the two and say what was better .  Um and how does this compare to the numbers  oh so OGI two is just the top top row ?  OK .  OK .  Uh OK so the one one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian .  An  Yeah .  Now up  Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection .  So filt is what that is ?  Oh we can't do it .  Oh OK .  Oh .  Too bad .  Good idea , but can't do it .  OK .  Uh - huh .  OK .  So  Alright so for now at least that 's not there  you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum  doesn't have a huge effect but it but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places .  Uh little bit .  Um and um um  Yeah  and uh let 's see  What else did we have in there ?  Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is  I I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit  uh And you you yellowed these out  uh but uh uh  Oh I see yeah that that one you can't use because of the delay .  Those look pretty good .  Um let 's see that one  Well even the just the the second row doesn't look that bad right ?  That 's just uh  yeah ?  And and that looks like an interesting one too .  Uh  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better .  And it 's it 's it 's a little slightly simpler .  So so there 's so I I would put that one also as a as a maybe .  Uh and it  yeah and it 's actually does does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched Italian ,  so s  and little worse on the mis on the MM case ,  but  uh Well yeah it 's worse than a few things  so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their their measure  and are are we running this uh for TI - digits  or uh  Now is TI di is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ?  Oh OK .  OK .  And see what else there is here .  Um Oh I see  the one I was looking down here at the the o the row below the lower yellowed one .  Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size reduced dimensionality .  What happens there is it 's around the same  and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .  It 's significantly worse  it 's it 's uh it 's it 's mostly worse .  Yeah .  But it is little .  I mean not not by a huge amount ,  I don't know .  What are what are the sizes of any of these sets ,  I I 'm I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten .  So you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?  About ?  So the so the sets so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say  and each sentence on the average has four or five digits  or is it most of them longer or  Mm - hmm .  Right , so between one and sixteen .  ",uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying  Do you e um they mentioned made some uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .  Um and we don't have the TI - digits part yet ?  And so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ?  OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good  then we could compare the two and say what was better .  Uh OK so the one one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian .  Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection .  Oh we can't do it .  So you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?  ,"They discussed most recent results, finalized plans to continue and discussed the work required and timing needed for completion of this stage of the project.

Bro007.B,"See the I mean the reason I 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ?  So uh i if if you had uh just you know to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a a tenth of a percent would just be one word ,  right ?  So so it wouldn't mean anything .  Oh  um so um yeah it be kind of I 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually .  Yeah since these  well also just to know the numbers ,  right .  So these these are word error rates  so this is on how many words .  Yeah .  Yeah  so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then then that that be great .  Um what else is there here ?  Um see the second second from the bottom it says SIL ,  but this is some different kind of silence or thing or  what was that ?  Yes .  Uh - huh , uh - huh .  The silence plus the KLT output ?  Oh so you 're only using the silence .  No .  I see .  OK .  And what and what 's OGI forty - five ?  The bottom one there ?  S  Right , but I mean what 's the what does the last row mean ?  I thought that was the one I thought that was the second row .  So what 's the difference between the second  Oh .  So this is like the second line but with with the combo stuff .  OK .  Yeah .  OK , so  alright  so it looks to me I guess the same  given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said I agree are are the ones to look at  but I just would add the the the second row one  and then um if we can um  oh yeah also when when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ?  I guess it 's probably on the percentages right ?  Yeah OK .  Alright .  OK .  Maybe maybe they 'll argue about it .  Um OK  so if we can know what how many words are in each  and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten Friday  and then we 'll operate with that  and uh how long did it  I guess if we 're not doing all these things if we 're only doing um  um I guess since this is development data it 's legitimate to do more than one ,  right ?  I mean ordinarily if in final test data you don't want to do several and and take the best  that 's that 's that 's not proper  but if this is development data we could still look at a couple .  Yeah .  I  Right .  But the question is when when do we fix the system ,  do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ?  I Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up .  Also , so  Um  Right  so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth  but we start the write - up right away because as you say there there 's only minor differences between these .  Yeah .  Yeah , and and I I would you know , I would I 'd kind of like to see it  maybe I can I can edit it a bit  uh sure .  The my what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is English .  Uh so  uh H yeah .  Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?  OK .  Yeah ?  Uh I see .  Yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny .  It 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean .  Uh No mitigation .  Wow .  Do you know what no what no mitigation means here ?  Oh that 's probably the  this is probably channel error stuff  huh ?  Oh this is i right , it says right above here channel channel error resilience ,  yeah .  So recognition performance is just the top part , actually .  Uh and they have yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and and evaluation .  And so  right ,  it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases  and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen .  Multi - condition multi - condition .  So they have looks like they have  uh uh  so they splitting up between the TI - digits and everything else , I see .  So the everything else is the SpeechDat - Car , that 's the multi multilingual  Well , it is .  It is ,  but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the TI - digits and these tables over here for the car data  which is which is I guess all the multilingual stuff  and then uh there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only .

Bro007.B,"Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days  I guess they have to send it out  let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh Wednesday  and I think the it has to be there by some hour uh European time on Wednesday  so I think basically  E excuse me ?  Yes , so I mean I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday  right  because I I think  uh Uh  yeah well .  W i is but is is it midni I thought it was actually something like five PM on  was like I thought it was five PM or something ,  I didn't think it was midnight .  I thought they said they wanted everything by  well , so five PM their time is is  if  three PM .  Alright , that 's six in the morning here .  Yes , yes , but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due ,  I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five PM or something .  In which case  so I I uh well we should look  but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday .  Um so then next Thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath  but then then we 'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish  but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed  so all we 'll do is take whatever they have and and uh and run it through the process .  Uh we won't be changing the training on anything  so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new HTK runs ,  so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after Tuesday  and and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research .  Um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately work on  uh uh so  What ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  But they 're ideas .  Yeah ?  Oh , that was good .  And and uh also it 's still true that uh I think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features  rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out .  The fact that none of these are are you know , enormous is is is not too surprising  most improvements aren't enormous  and uh  some of them are  but uh I mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements  but uh um Cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs ,  but  Anyway  OK  well I I think I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about  or or are we done ?  Uh - huh .  Yeah , I mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it .  Uh if you can fit it in .  Oh I have yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh I should tell people outside of this group too  uh I don't know if we 're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands  and and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or I don't know , eight hundred megahertz or something  and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti  so if you know he 's got a lot of processing power  and um  we 'd have to schedule it  but if we have some big jobs and we wanna wanna wanna run them he 's he 's offering it .  So .  It 's uh  when he was here eh uh he he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell ,  so  so in some ways he just got his payback ,  but uh again I I don't know if we 'll end up with if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group  but but if if we are that 's an offer .  OK  well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's that that 's really neat  and uh  we 'll uh uh g don't think we need to uh  um Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say is that uh the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection  and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now  so that 's that 's another source of data .  Um which is s under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room  the uh that you know if we feel there 's other measurements we don't have that we 'd like to have we can make them  and  uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago  so uh that 's another another possibility for this this kind of work .

Bro007.C,"So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network  and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features .  And so these low - pass filtered goes through M eh another MLP  and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this KLT .  Um the output is used as uh features as well .  Yeah .  Yeah  so  yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard  Yeah .  So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths .  The first is a KLT using several frames of the features .  The second path is uh MLP also using nine frames several frames of features  The third path is this low - pass filter .  Uh , MLP  Adding the outputs just like in the second propose the the proposal from for the first evaluation .  And then the KLT and then the two together again .  Um . So this is  yeah  Yeah  that 's the reason , yeah .  For the f the f first yellow line you mean ?  Yeah  so it 's uh basically s the same except that we don't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams .  Well .  There 's there 's no low low - pass processing used as additional feature stream .  Um  Yeah .  Uh actually the way things seems to  um well it 's uh forty percent for TI - digit , sixty for all the SpeechDat - Cars ,  well all these languages .

Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results  Uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah  there is something funny happening here because  yeah .  But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty - two and  but  Yeah .  So there are some results here  uh so the third and the fifth line of the table  Filt , yeah  Um yeah so it seems f for the the well match and mismatched condition  it 's uh it brings something .  Uh but uh actually apparently there are there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay .  Uh well  No .  Uh  Yeah .  Except I don't know because they I think they are still working well .  Uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector  so but  yeah  if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side .  Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset  and  but well hmm For the moment they have this large delay on the the feature computation and so we don't  I th  Yeah .  Yep .

Uh , well  Hmm  Well , first , uh , to really have a look at at the speech from these databases  because , well , we tried several thing ,  but we did not really look at what what 's happening , and where is the noise , and  Eh  Yeah .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Actually , there is one thing that well Um , generally we we think that most of the errors are within phoneme classes ,  and  so I think it could be interesting to to see if it I don't think it 's still true when we add noise ,  and so we have I I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech .  And probably , there is much more between classes errors for noisy speech .  And so , um  Yeah , so perhaps we could have a a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , uh , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply .  And which is a s a s a simpler problem , perhaps , but which is perhaps important for noisy speech .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  No .  Sure .  Mm - hmm .  No ,  actually actually the well - matched condition is still quite di still quite difficult .  I mean , it 's they have all these data from the close mike and from the distant mike , from different driving condition , open window , closed window ,  and they take all of this  and they take seventy percent , I think , for training and thirty percent for testing .  So , training is done on different conditions and different microphones ,  and testing also is done on different microphone and conditions .  So , probably if we only take the close microphones , I guess the results should be much much better than this .  Mmm .  Uh  Yeah ,  so there is this , the mismatched is , um the same kind of thing ,  but the driving conditions , I mean the speed and the kind of road , is different for training and testing ,  is that right ?  And the last condition is close microphone for training and distant for testing .  Yeah .  So s so  Yeah .  Mmm .  Actually , yeah , it 's very close to clean speech training because , well , because the close microphone and noisy speech testing ,  yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah .  But the I mean , the th th  it doesn't work .  It  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  Hmm .  Yeah ,  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  so d  well  Actually , this is tha that 's why we  well , it 's a different kind of data .  We 're not we 're not used to work with this kind of data .  That 's why we should have a loo more closer look at what 's going on .  Um  Yeah .  So this would be the first thing ,  and then , of course , try to well , kind of debug what was wrong , eh , when we do Aurora test on the MSG particularly , and on the multi - band .  Uh  Yeah , but  Again , it 's the kind of of thing that , uh , we were thin thinking thinking that it would work , but it didn't work .  And , eh , so there is kind of of not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps .  Uh , something wrong , perhaps in the just in the the fact that the labels are  well  What worked best is the hand - labeled data .  Um  Uh , so , yeah .  I don't know if we can get some hand - labeled data from other languages .  It 's not so easy to find .  ","Y Actually , uh , um , for the Danish , there 's still some kind of mystery  because , um , um , when we use the straight features , we are not able to get these nice number  with the ICSI OGI one , I mean .  Uh , so , uh , that 's probably something wrong with the features that we get from OGI .  Uh , and Sunil is working on on trying to to check everything .  this Tuesday ,  So , Hynek will try to push for trying to combine , uh , different things ?  Well , first , uh , to really have a look at at the speech from these databases  because , well , we tried several thing ,  but we did not really look at what what 's happening , and where is the noise , and  Actually , there is one thing that well Um , generally we we think that most of the errors are within phoneme classes ,  so I think it could be interesting to to see if it I don't think it 's still true when we add noise ,  and so we have I I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech .  And probably , there is much more between classes errors for noisy speech .  Yeah , so perhaps we could have a a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , uh , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply .  Again , it 's the kind of of thing that , uh , we were thin thinking thinking that it would work , but it didn't work .  And , eh , so there is kind of of not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps .

I don't know if we can get some hand - labeled data from other languages .  ",

Bro008.D,"OK .  So , uh  You can fill those out , uh after , actually ,  so  So , I got , uh these results from , uh , Stephane .  Also , um , I think that , uh um we might hear later today , about other results .  I think s that , uh , there were some other very good results that we 're gonna wanna compare to .  But , r our results from other other places ,  yeah .  Um , I got this from you  and then I sent a note to Sunil about the cuz he has been running some other systems  other than the the ICSI OGI one .  So um , I wan wanna wanna see what that is .  But , uh , you know , so we 'll see what it is comparatively later .  But it looks like , um  You know most of the time , even I mean even though it 's true that the overall number for Danish we didn't improve it  If you look at it individually , what it really says is that there 's , um , uh  Looks like out of the six cases , between the different kinds of , uh , matching conditions out of the six cases , there 's basically , um , a couple where it stays about the same ,  uh , three where it gets better , and one where it gets worse .  Uh , go ahead .  Oh ,  and and we have a little time on that and actually  so  We have a little bit of time on that , actually .  We have a day or so ,  so  When when when do you folks leave ?  Sunday ?  So  So , uh  Yeah ,  until Saturday midnight , or something , we have  W we we have time ,  yeah .  Well , that would be good .  That 'd be good .  Yeah .  Uh , and , you know , i u when whenever anybody figures it out they should also , for sure , email Hynek  because Hynek will be over there telling people what we did ,  so he should know .  Good ,  OK .  So , um  So , we 'll we 'll hold off on that a little bit .  I mean , even with these results as they are , it 's it 's it 's really not that bad .  But but , uh , um  And it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any any bugs being fixed is that , uh , on the the other tasks , we had this average of , uh , forty uh nine percent , or so , improvement .  And here we have somewhat better than that than the Danish , and somewhat worse than that on the German ,  but I mean , it sounds like , uh , one way or another , the methods that we 're doing can reduce the error rate from from mel ceptrum down by , you know a fourth of them to , uh , a half of them .  Somewhere in there , depending on the exact case .  So  So that 's good .  I mean , I think that , uh , one of the things that Hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals  and  and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , uh , combination of things .  Um , if , uh  Cuz there 's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing .  And there 's things that we 're doing that they 're not doing .  And and they all seem like good things .  So  So  Well , we don't know yet .  Uh , I mean , first place , there 's still this thing to to work out ,  and second place second thing is that the only results that we have so far from before were really development set results .  So , I think in this community that 's of interest .  It 's not like everything is being pinned on the evaluation set .  But , um , for the development set , our best result was a little bit short of fifty percent .  And the best result of any system was about fifty - four ,  where these numbers are the , uh , relative , uh , reduction in , uh , word error rate .  And , um , the other systems were , uh , somewhat lower than that .  There was actually there was much less of a huge range than there was in Aurora one .  In Aurora one there were there were systems that ba basically didn't improve things .  And here the the worst system still reduced the error rate by thirty - three percent , or something , in development set .  So so , you know , sort of everybody is doing things between , well , roughly a third of the errors , and half the errors being eliminated , uh , and varying on different test sets and so forth .  So I think  Um It 's probably a good time to look at what 's really going on and seeing if there 's a there 's a way to combine the best ideas  while at the same time not blowing up the amount of , uh , resources used ,  cuz that 's that 's critical for this this test .  Um , uh , the , uh , the there were two systems that were put forth by a combination of of , uh , French Telecom and Alcatel .  And , um they they differed in some respects ,  ","So , I got , uh these results from , uh , Stephane .  Also , um , I think that , uh um we might hear later today , about other results .  I think s that , uh , there were some other very good results that we 're gonna wanna compare to .  But , r our results from other other places ,  You know most of the time , even I mean even though it 's true that the overall number for Danish we didn't improve it  We have a little bit of time on that , actually .

Sunday ?  until Saturday midnight , or something , we have  I mean , even with these results as they are , it 's it 's it 's really not that bad .

Bro008.D,"but they e em one was called the French Telecom Alcatel System the other was called the Alcatel French Telecom System , uh , which is the biggest difference , I think .  But but there 're there 're there 're some other differences , too .  Uh , and and , uh , they both did very well ,  you know ?  So , um , my impression is they also did very well on on the the , uh , evaluation set ,  but , um , I I we haven't seen  you 've - you haven't seen any final results for that  yeah .  There is a couple pieces to it .  There 's a spectral subtraction style piece it was basically , you know , Wiener filtering .  And then then there was some p some modification of the cepstral parameters , where they  Yeah .  But some people have done exactly that sort of thing ,  of of and the I mean it 's not To to look in speech only , to try to m to measure these things during speech ,  that 's p that 's not that uncommon .  But i it it so it looks like they did some some , uh , reasonable things ,  uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely .  We did unreasonable things , which because we like to try strange things ,  and and , uh , and our things worked too .  And so , um ,  uh , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do .  But the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they 're using  because these , uh , standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects .  Uh , they didn't report it , if they did .  Yeah .  I think everybody was focused elsewhere .  Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a a , uh a filtering , which leads to a a , uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample .  So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits .  That was misreported the first time out .  It it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , uh , they were repeating the packets .  So it was they were s they they had twenty - four hundred bits per second , but they were literally creating forty - eight hundred bits per second , um , even though y it was just repeated .  So , uh , in practice  Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on .  So  so in reality , if you put this this system in into , uh , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred .  So ,  um , so that 's a nice feature of what what we did .  Um ,  but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out .  Um , and then there 's the whole standards process , which is another thing altogether .  Uh , probably the day after they leave ,  but we 'll have to we 'll have to stop it the day before we leave .  I think tha I think the the meeting is on the thirteenth or something .  And , uh ,  they , uh  Right .  And the the , uh , results are due like the day before the meeting or something .  So  I th I think I I think they are ,  yeah .  So um , since we have a bit farther to travel than some of the others , uh , we 'll have to get done a little quicker .  But , um , I mean , it 's just tracing down these bugs .  I mean , just exactly this sort of thing of , you know , why why these features seem to be behaving differently , uh , in California than in Oregon .  Might have something to do with electricity shortage .  Uh , we didn't we didn't have enough electrons here  and  Uh , but , um  Uh , I think , you know , the main reason for having  I mean , it only takes w to run the the two test sets in just in computer time is just a day or so ,  right ?  So  yeah .  So , I think the who the whole reason for having as long as we have , which was like a week and a half , is is because of bugs like that .  So  Huh  So , we 're gonna end up with these same kind of sheets that have the the percentages and so on just for the  Oh , I guess it 's the same sheets ,  yeah ,  yeah  just with the missing columns filled in .  Yeah .  Well , that 'll be good .  So , I 'll dis I 'll disregard these numbers .  That 's that 's that 's good .  Uh , well that 's um  yeah  I mean , I think the question is "" Is there is there some advantage ? ""  I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard .  ","But i it it so it looks like they did some some , uh , reasonable things ,  uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely .

Bro008.D,"But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do  Now for instance , uh , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , "" Here 's a number of things that could be done . ""  So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did ,  and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too .  So ,  um , uh , that 's one one aspect of it .  And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering Uh ,  I mean , the VAD stuff they both had ,  right ?  And , um , so and they both had some kind of on - line normalization ,  right ?  Of sorts ,  yeah ?  So  so , it seems like the main different there is the is the , uh , filtering .  And the filtering I think if you can  shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part .  So , if you can if you can add those in um then , uh , you can cut the data rate in half .  So it seems like the right thing to do is to on the on the terminal 's side , take what they did , if it if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish ,  uh , take what they did add in a filter , and add in some stuff on the server 's side  and and and that 's probably a reasonable standard .  Um Uh  Yeah , so that 's that 's that 's what  That would be ideal would be is that they could , you know , they could actually show that , in fact , a combination of some sort , uh , would work even better than what what any of the systems had .  And , um , then it would it would , uh be something to to discuss in the meeting .  But , uh , not clear what will go on .  Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there .  I mean , you can always have another standard after that ,  but this process has gone on for a while on already  and and people might just wanna pick something and say , "" OK , this is it . ""  And then , that 's a standard .  Uh , standards are always optional .  It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product ,  or Uh um  And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on .  So it 's not final even if they declared a standard .  The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to to declare a standard .  So  you you you will be you will become experts on this and know more far more than me about the tha this particular standards process once you you go to this meeting .  So ,  be interested in hearing .  So , uh , I 'd be , uh , interested in hearing , uh , your thoughts now  I mean you 're almost done .  I mean , you 're done in the sense that , um , you may be able to get some new features from Sunil , and we 'll re - run it .  Uh , but other than that , you 're you 're basically done ,  right ?  So , uh , I 'm interested in hearing hearing your thoughts about where you think we should go from this .  I mean , we tried a lot of things in a hurry ,  and , uh , if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something , and not have doing things quickly be quite so much the constraint , what what you think would be the best thing to do .  OK .  It 's a novel idea .  Look at the data .  OK .  Or more generally , I guess , what what is causing the degradation .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  The other thing that strikes me , just looking at these numbers is , just taking the best cases ,  I mean , some of these , of course , even with all of our our wonderful processing , still are horrible kinds of numbers .  But just take the best case , the well - matched uh , German case after er well - matched Danish after we  the kind of numbers we 're getting are about eight or nine uh p percent error per digit .  This is obviously not usable ,  right ?  I mean , if you have ten digits for a phone number I mean , every now and then you 'll get it right .  I mean , it 's it 's , uh , um  So , I mean , the other thing is that , uh  And and a and and also , um part of what 's nice about this is that this is , uh , um a realistic almost realistic database .  I mean , it 's still not people who are really trying to accomplish something ,  ","But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do  So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did ,  and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too .

Bro008.D,"but but , uh , within the artificial setup , it isn't noise artificially added , you know , simulated , uh , additive noise .  It 's real noise condition .  And , um , the the training the training , I guess , is always done on the close talking  No ?  Yeah .  I see .  Oh , OK ,  that explains it partially .  Wha - what about  i in so the the  go ahead .  Uh , OK ,  so  I see .  So , yeah ,  so the high so the right so the highly mismatched case is in some sense a good model for what we 've been , you know , typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in  And so and i i k it does correspond to a realistic situation in the sense that , um , people might really be trying to , uh , call out telephone numbers or some or something like that , in in their cars  and they 're trying to connect to something .  Um  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And the well - matched condition is what you might imagine that you might be able to approach , if you know that this is the application .  You 're gonna record a bunch on people in cars and so forth , and do these training .  And then , uh , when y you sell it to somebody , they will be a different person with a different car , and so on .  So it 's this is a an optim somewhat optimistic view on it ,  uh , so , you know , the real thing is somewhere in between the two .  Uh ,  uh , but  Even the optimistic one is  Yeah ,  right .  Right ,  it doesn't work .  So , in a way , that 's , you know , that 's sort of the dominant thing  is that even , say on the development set stuff that we saw , the , uh , the numbers that , uh , that Alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers , it was just you know , it wasn't good enough for for a a for a real system .  You you  you , um  So , uh , we still have stuff to do .  Uh , and , uh  I don't know  So , looking at the data , where , you know what 's the what 's what 's th what 's characteristic  i e yeah , I think that 's that 's a good thing .  Does a any you have any thoughts about what else y you 're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time ?  Uh  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , cuz a lot of time it 's true ,  there were a lot of times when we 've tried something and it didn't work right away , even though we had an intuition that there should be something there .  And so then we would just stop it .  Um  And , uh , one of the things I don't remember the details on , but I remember at some point , when you were working with a second stream , and you tried a low - pass filtering to cepstrum , in some case you got  Well , but it was an MSG - like thing , but it wasn't MSG ,  right ?  Uh , you y I think in some case you got some little improvement ,  but it was , you know , sort of a small improvement ,  and it was a a big added complication , so you dropped it .  But , um , that was just sort of one try ,  right ?  You just took one filter , threw it there ,  right ?  And it seems to me that , um , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying .  And , uh  Uh , and you had , you know , you had the multi - band things also , and , you know , there was issue of that .  Um , Barry 's going to be , uh , continuing working on multi - band things as well .  We were just talking about , um , some , uh , some work that we 're interested in .

Um , and Um ,  so , I think that , you know , this is a , uh this is a neat data set .  Um , and then , uh , as we mentioned before , we also have the the new , uh , digit set coming up from recordings in this room .  So , there 's a lot of things to work with .  Um  and , uh  what I like about it , in a way , is that , uh , the results are still so terrible .  Uh Uh I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know .  We 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction .  That 's that 's really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time .

Uh Uh I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know .  We 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction .  That 's that 's really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time .  But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that that , uh , no one could really use it .  ",
Bro008.D,"I think that 's great that because and y also because again , it 's not something  sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something  we take a very  Uh , at one point , uh , Brian and I went downstairs into the the basement where it was it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant  and we we made some recordings there .  And then we we , uh uh , made a simulation of the of the room acoustics there and and applied it to other things ,  and uh  But it was all pretty artificial ,  and and , you know , how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway ?  Um So ,  uh This is what 's nice about the Aurora data and the data here , is that is that it 's sort of a realistic room situation uh , acoustics acoustic situation , both terms in noise and reflections , and so on  and n n And , uh ,  uh , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well .  So  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  No , I I think there 's lots of lots of good things to do with this .  So  Um  So let 's  I guess You were gonna say something else ?  Oh , OK .  What do you think ?  Anything  S b  Yeah .  Yeah .  Also , uh , I mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data .  So one form of different data was is from different languages , but the other  Well , i in fact , uh , m in those experiments it wasn't so much combining multiple nets , it was a single net that had different  So , first thing is would it be better if they were multiple nets , for some reason ?  Second thing is , never mind the different languages , just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one ,  would it be helpful to have different ones ?  So , um  That was a question that was kind of raised by Mike Shire 's thesis , and on in that case in terms of reverberation .  Right ?  That that sometimes it might be better to do that .  But , um , I don't think we know for sure .  So , um  Right .  So , next week , we , uh , won't meet because you 'll be in Europe .  Whe - when are you two getting back ?  Yeah , that 's right .

Bro010.A,"OK , we 're on .  Oh , this was the , uh , talk where they were supposed to try to decide  Ah , right .  What 's the allowable ?  What were they thinking of changing it to ?  Huh .  Ah !  Think of it as what ?  Hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency .  Um , we had a silence detector ,  so  we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector .  And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance .  Um ,  but it was ,  uh ,  I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds .  Yeah ,  we did the back trace at that point  to get the answer .  No ,  no it was pretty quick .  So  this w  Right .  Right .  Right .  And it felt to , uh , the users that it was instantaneous .  I mean , as fast as talking to a person .  It th I don't think anybody ever complained about the delay .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I don't remember the exact numbers  but  it was something like that .  I don't think you can really tell .  A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , uh , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds ,  and  I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .  I mean it just it feels so quick .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean , it may feel different than talking to a person  because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances .  So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done .  So it it would probably feel different  but I don't think it would feel slow .  So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ?  Wasn't there  Was it in the , uh , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ?  A little bit .

Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But what is the  it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency .  I mean , depending on where the window was that you used to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio .  OK ,  well that I guess that was my question ,  yeah .  Guess .  Were his , uh , windows centered around the  We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files ,  and built the averages from them .  Very slow adaptation .  th  If they 're going to provide a , uh , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ?  What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ?  Hmm .  And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,  uh  are these something that you decide ahead of time ,  like "" I 'm going to look for this particular feature  or I 'm going to look at this frequency , ""  or  What what what are they looking at ?

Bro010.A,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah .  Right .  So where it could help is maybe at a higher level .  Yeah .  Understanding ,  yeah .  Exactly .  Uh ,  well I don't know .  We d we sort of didn't get that far .  Um , we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans  and , um ,  because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that .

Bro010.B,"I don't know .  Do you have news from the conference talk ?  Uh ,  that was programmed for yesterday I guess .  Well  Alright .  To to decide what to do ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , well , we 've a little bit worked on trying to see , uh , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies .  So ,  We took first we took the LDA filters  and , uh , we designed new filters ,  using uh recursive filters actually .  I 'm sorry ?  Uh , us .  Yeah .  So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , uh , IIR filters that have the same frequency response .  Well , similar , but that have shorter delays .  So they had two filters ,  one for the low frequency bands  and another for the high frequency bands .  And so we redesigned two filters .  And the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay ,  and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the IIR filters .  But it 's not yet test .  So we have the filters  but we still have to implement a routine that does recursive filtering  and  No .  No .  Yeah , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Uh ,  I  yeah ,  I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to  They were trying to do something different like taking , uh well , using filter that takes only a past  and  this is just a little bit different .  But I will I will send him an email and tell him exactly what we are doing ,  so .  Um ,  Mm - hmm .  Alright .  Um ,  Yeah .  Well , there is w one , um , remark about these filters , that they don't have a linear phase .  So ,  Well , I don't know ,  perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt  because the phase is almost linear  but .  Um ,  and so , yeah , for the delay I gave you here , it 's it 's , uh , computed on the five hertz modulation frequency ,  which is the mmm , well , the most important for speech  so .  Uh ,  this is the first thing .  Yeah .  Three hundred and thirty .  Yeah ,  but there are other points actually ,  uh ,  which will perhaps add some more delay .  Is that some other other stuff in the process were perhaps not very um perf well , not very correct ,  like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames .  Um ,  so we will try also to add a nice downsampling  having a filter that that  well , a low - pass filter at at twenty - five hertz .  Uh , because wh when when we look at the LDA filters , well , they are basically low - pass  but they leave a lot of what 's above twenty - five hertz .  Um ,  and so , yeah ,  this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again .  Um ,  yeah ,  and then there 's a third thing ,  is that , um , basically the way on - line normalization was done uh , is just using this recursion on on the um , um , on the feature stream ,  and but this is a filter ,  so it has also a delay .  Uh ,  and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds .  So if we  Yeah .  If we want to be very correct ,  so if we want to the estimation of the mean t t to to be well , the right estimation of the mean , we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Um ,  But , well , when we add up everything it 's it will be alright .  We would be at six  so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling ,  plus eighty - five for the on - line normalization .  So it 's  plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA .  So it would be around two hundred and forty  so , well ,  plus plus the frames ,  but it 's OK .  Hmm .  Yeah .  So , yeah .  Yeah ,  and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency .  So .  Well .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Uh , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , uh , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear .  And the other is linear but it 's not discriminant at all .  Well , it 's it 's a linear transformation , that  Uh  Mmm .  Well  uh  yeah .  Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also .  And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation .  And if the neural net is better than this  or , well .  So .  Ye  Mmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So it would be on the  um  on on the mel frequency bands ,  so . Yeah ,  be before everything .  Yeah ,  um  Um .  Mmm , yeah .  I guess it 's power domain , yeah .

Bro010.B,"so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise ,  and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR .  So . Well .  When the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level , the coefficient is small , and around one .  But when the power le the s signal level is uh small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important .  And this reduce actually the music musical noise ,  uh  which is more important during silence portions ,  when the s the energy 's small .  So there are tricks like this  but , mmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  sure .  But  Mmm .  Yeah , but it  Actually , it 's a mmm If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future .

Well , in in the paper he showed that actually the estimation of the noise is is delayed .  Well , it 's there is  you you have to center the window ,  yeah .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah .

Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme  but ,  is it very useful  and is the c  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , so .  Yeah ,  they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate ,  and  So .  Yeah .  I think . Yeah , I think Ericsson used this kind of threshold .

Is is that right  or ?  So it 's it 's  Yeah .  It 's like saying what 's under the threshold is silence ,  and  I d I  Y you know , perhaps ?

Um ,  Uh ,  so  I mean , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead ,  because even if they tell us that , uh , the rules are different , uh , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .  So what are you doing ?  So when you say "" we "" , is that something Sunil is doing  or is that ?  Who is doing that ?  Oh , oh .  Oh , OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ?  Uh - huh .  Yeah , you should talk with him .  Yeah .

Um ,  I mean  We just we just have to be in contact more .  I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication .  So .  OK .  Right .  So that would be , uh , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds ,  which , uh  What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ?  So that would be within ?  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Eighty - five .  Hmm !  That 's a little bit of a problem .  Uh ,  yeah , but then there 's  Oh .  Just just barely in there .  Two - fifty ,  unless they changed the rules .  Which there is there 's some discussion of .  But  Uh , well the people who had very low latency want it to be low uh , very very very narrow , uh , latency bound .  And the people who have longer latency don't .  So .  Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency ,  but  But , uh ,  you know , it 's  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so they were basically  I mean ,  they were more or less trading computation for performance  and we were , uh , trading latency for performance .  And they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't ,  and so I think of it as complementary ,  that if we can put the  Complementary .  I think the best systems  so , uh , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system ,  which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years .  Uh , which is we say , well this is the way we should do it .  And then we do it .  And then someone else does something that 's straight forward .  So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise  and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise .  We just , uh , you know , trained up systems to be more discriminant .  And , uh , we did this , uh , RASTA - like filtering  which was done in the log domain  and was tending to handle convolutional noise .  We did we actually did nothing about additive noise .  So , um ,  the , uh , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job .  And so ,  uh ,  we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff .  I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both  but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency .  To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing .  And and , uh , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .  I mean , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server  and , uh , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . It doesn't seem like it 's that big a deal .  These aren't large vocabulary things  so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and .  So .  No .  What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , uh , the the the surgical , uh , uh , microscopes and so forth .  Um , how long was it from when somebody , uh , finished an utterance to when , uh , something started happening ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  and that 's when you 'd start doing things .  Yeah .  Of course that didn't take too long at that point .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so you you so you had a  so you had a a quarter second delay before , uh , plus some little processing time ,  and then the the microscope would start moving or something .  Yeah .

Uh , I mean , it doe did look like it buys you something over just the KLT .  But maybe it 's just the discrimination  and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary .  Could be .  Good good to know .  But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction ,  so you just kind of , uh  At what stage do you do that ?  Do you you 're doing that ,  um ?  OK ,  so just do that on the mel f  So so you know that that that the way that they 're  uh , one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries .  And then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition .  The reason for that was that , um , uh if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't ,  uh , or one had a better VAD than the other  since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task ,  and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection .  It still wouldn't be perfect  but I mean ,  e the argument was "" let 's not have that be part of this test . ""  "" Let 's let 's separate that out . ""  And so ,  uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday  and ,  yeah , I 'm sorry ,  I don't don't know the answer  but we should find out .  I 'm sure we 'll find out soon  what they , uh what they decided .  So , uh  Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD  but otherwise it 's it 's on the the , uh the mel fil filter bank , uh , energies I guess ?  You do doing the ?  And you 're you 're subtracting in the in the in the I guess it 's power power domain ,  uh , or or magnitude domain .  Probably power domain , right ?  why  Yeah ,  yep .  I mean , if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain  but but , uh , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain  and  I have asked people why  and they shrug their shoulders and say , "" oh , it works . ""  So .  Uh ,  and there 's this  I guess there 's this mysterious  I mean people who do this a lot I guess have developed little tricks of the trade .  I mean , there 's there 's this , um  you don't just subtract the the estimate of the noise spectrum .  You subtract th that times  Or or less ,  or  Yeah .  Uh .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  ","we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time  by by , uh , playing around a little bit ,  going more into the past ,  Mm - hmm .  uh , one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries .  And then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition .  uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday  I don't don't know the answer  but we should find out .  ","The group also touched upon matters that had broader implications for the work, such as the work of other groups on the same project. "
Bro010.C,"Well , that 's I mean , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s uh , spectral subtraction methods .  I mean , if if you have , uh , fair assurance that , uh , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise ,  get a much better estimate , and subtract it off .  But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , uh , with some forgetting factor or something .  Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum .  So one of the things that , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch did , uh and pas and other people  actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess ,  was to , uh , take some period of of of speech and in each band , uh , develop a histogram .  So , to get a decent histogram of these energies takes at least a few seconds really .  But , uh I mean you can do it with a smaller amount  but it 's pretty rough .  And , um , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this .  So  No , no ,  it 's based on this kind of method ,  this histogram method .  So you have a histogram .  Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram ,  which you could approximate as two Gaussians .  Oh , yeah .  So you have a mixture of two Gaussians .  Right ?  And you can use EM to figure out what it is . You know .  So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians ,  you you n know what they are ,  and , uh  I mean , sorry ,  you estimate what they are ,  and , uh ,  so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum .  And then you look over the whole thing  and now you have a noise spectrum .  So , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch and others have used that kind of method .  And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , uh , uh , determine through magical means that that , uh , there 's no speech in some period ,  and then see what the spectrum is .  Uh ,  but ,  you know , it 's that that that 's tricky to do .  It has mistakes .  Uh , and if you 've got enough time , uh , this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable .  Uh , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just , uh you can do a w a uh an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only .  I guess it is EM still ,  but just just determine the means only .  Don't worry about the variances .  And then you just use those mean values as being the the , uh uh signal - to - noise ratio in that band .  Not necessarily .  Cuz if you don't look into the future ,  right ?  if you just  yeah  I mean , if you just  if you  you , uh  a at the beginning you have some  esti some guess  and and , uh , uh  It 's an interesting question .  I wonder how they did do it ?  Well , yeah ,  but what does what what what does Alcatel do ?  And and France Telecom .  Pretty stationary .  Well , the thing , e e e e  Yeah , y I mean , you 're talking about non - stationary noise  but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise ,  you know ?  But it 's hard to  but that 's hard to do .  Yeah .  So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise .  That 's what spectral subtraction will help with , practically speaking .  If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech ,  even if it 's centered ,  right ?  if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem .  I mean , imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum ,  right ?  So imagine a jack hammer going at five hertz .  I mean , good good luck .  So ,  Yeah .  Yeah .  No , I understand it 's better to do  but I just think that that , uh , for real noises wh what what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary  where you can use one or another spectral subtraction thing  and other things where it 's not so stationary  and  I mean , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods ,  uh ,  uh ,  but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , uh , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice .  I think that it 's uh  Yeah .  Well .  Just cheat  You 're saying , cheat .  ","Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum .  Not necessarily .  Cuz if you don't look into the future ,  but what does what what what does Alcatel do ?  And and France Telecom .  Yeah , y I mean , you 're talking about non - stationary noise  but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise ,  But it 's hard to  ",
Bro010.C,"Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah ,  sure .  But but  you know , stationary  Right ,  the word "" stationary "" is has a very precise statistical meaning .  But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , uh , compared with our our processing techniques .  So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly .  It 's not gonna stay absolute the same .  If you if you check it out , uh , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road  or whatever .  But it 's it 's i i i  using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well .  But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech  and then later  Uh , so they may be you know , may be overly , uh , complicated for for this test  but  but but , uh ,  I don't know .  But what you 're saying , you know , makes sense , though .  I mean , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , uh , the center of the center of the window .  But  uh , we 're already having problems with these delay , uh delay issues .  So ,  uh , we 'll have to figure ways without it .  Um ,  Oh , yeah .  You bet .  Yeah .  So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing ,  right ?  Is they 're  they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections  and getting some , uh  Does France Telecom do this  Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ?  More or less ?  OK .  Um ,  OK ,  if we 're we 're done done with that ,  uh ,  let 's see .  Uh , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly ,  just , uh , things that that we 've been chatting about  but haven't made it into these meetings yet .  So you 're coming up with your quals proposal ,  and , uh Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ?  Yeah .  So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network .  So that 's all it is .  It 's a sig it 's a sigmoid ,  uh , with weighted sum at the input ,  which you train by gradient descent .  Well , actually ,  yeah ,  so I was using EM to get the targets .  So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output .  And then he uses , uh , i u and then feeding into that are  I 'm sorry ,  there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ?  Yeah ,  so that 's the product .  And then ,  um ,  then he has each of these AND things .  And ,  um ,  but  so they 're little neural neural units .  Um ,  and , um ,  they have to have targets .  And so the targets come from EM .  You know , it has a number of properties that I really liked .  I mean , one is the going towards , um , using narrow band information for , uh , ph phonetic features of some sort  rather than just , uh , immediately going for the the typical sound units .  Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule ,  which is what , uh , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties ,  uh , for people listening to narrow band stuff . That 's Friday 's talk , by the way .  And then , um ,  Uh , the third thing I like about it is ,  uh , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit  but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything ,  um , this issue of where the targets come from .  So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , uh , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there  and we say , "" OK , we train every ""  What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is  or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units .  But but , um ,  along the way how much should we , uh  uh , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?  I mean , because , uh , we don't know uh , that this is a particularly good feature .  I mean , there 's no way , uh  someone in the audience yesterday was asking , "" well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? ""  But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , uh , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible .  It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less .  I mean  Well not  I mean , it 's g all g  narrow band  uh ,  ","Uh , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly ,  So you 're coming up with your quals proposal ,  ",There were also some progress reports from group members working on other projects. 
Bro010.C,"i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination .  So , um ,  um , we don't really know how those should be labeled .  It could sh be that you should , um , not be paying that much attention to , uh , certain bands for certain sounds , uh , in order to get the best result .  So , um , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that .  We trained these things up on the on the , uh the final label .  Now we have I guess done experiments  you 've probably done stuff where you have , um , done separate , uh , Viterbis on the different  Yeah .  You 've done that .  Did did that help at all ?  So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful  because in a sense that 's the same sort of thing . You 're taking global information and determining what you how you should  But this is this is , uh , I th I think a little more direct .  And  Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , uh , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant .  So he hasn't applied it to recognition  or if he did he didn't talk about it .  It 's it 's just  And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , um , the , uh ,  uh he he did a comparison to , uh , you know , our old foil ,  the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth .  And , um , it didn't do nearly as well ,  especially in in noise .  But the  one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .  I mean , this use of a very smooth , uh , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition  but if you knew that what you were gonna do is detect sonorants or not  So sonorants and non - sonorants is is is almost like voiced - unvoiced , except I guess that the voiced stops are are also called "" obstruents "" .  Uh ,  so it 's  it 's uh , but with the exception of the stops I guess it 's pretty much the same as voiced - unvoiced ,  right ?  So so  Um .  So , um ,  if you knew you were doing that ,  if you were doing something say for a a , uh a a Vocoder , you wouldn't use the same kind of features .  You would use something that was sensitive to the periodicity and and not just the envelope .  Uh , and so in that sense it was an unfair test .  Um ,  so I think that the questioner was right .  It it was in that sense an unfair test .  Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , uh , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition ,  these smooth envelopes .  And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , uh , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not .  Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent .  The - these same people ?  I don't remember that .  That would that 's  you 're right ,  that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is  suppose you did that , uh , got that right .  Um ,  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so there 's a half dozen like that that are  Now this was coming at it from a different angle  but maybe it 's a good way to start .  Uh , these are things which , uh , John felt that a a , uh a human annotator would be able to reliably mark .  So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things .  Yeah .  Uh  But stress doesn't , uh , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another ,  right ?  It 's a it 's a good thing to mark  and will probably help us ultimate with recognition  but  Well , yeah ,  but i either case you 'd write PERMIT ,  right ?  So you 'd get the word right .  Um ,  We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  But that 's this afternoon 's meeting .  Yeah .  We don't understand anything in this meeting .  Yeah ,  so that 's  yeah ,  that 's , you know , a neat neat thing  and  and , uh  So .  Yeah ,  I mean , that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time .  But but , uh , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John  and and , uh ,  and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think .  Uh - huh .  Yeah , I think it 's an interesting interesting way to go .  Um ,  ",,
Bro010.C,"I say it like "" said - int "" . I think it has a number of good things .

So , um , I mean , there 's there 's all this work on arrays ,  but the other thing is , uh , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes ,  uh , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them ,  as we as we have over there .  An obstruction between them .  It creates a shadow  which is is helpful .  It 's part of why you have such good directionality with , with two ears  even though they 're not several feet apart .

Um , but I 'm , uh , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and uh Mazin Rahim .  Um , they they have a system that 's , uh , a multi - band , um , system  but their multi - band is is a little different than the way that we 've been doing multi - band in the past ,  where um Where we 've been @ @ uh taking um sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets ,  and then combining them some somehow down the line ,  um ,  they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , um , training up a detector that detects for , um , these phonetic features  for example , um , he presents um , uh , a detector to detect sonorance .  And so what what it basically is is , um it 's there 's  at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga I mean , it 's an AND gate .  So , uh , on each sub - band you have several independent tests ,  to test whether um , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band .  And then , um , it c it 's combined by a soft AND gate .  And at the at the higher level ,  for every if ,  um  The higher level there 's a soft OR gate .  Uh , so if if this detector detects um , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect uh , the OR gate at the top says , "" OK , well this frame has evidence of sonorance . ""  And these are all  Oh , OK .  Well , the low level detectors are logistic regressions .  Um ,  and  the , uh  the one o  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah ,  so he uses , um , an EM algorithm to to um train up these um parameters for the logistic regression .  The  Mm - hmm .  Um  Uh  Right ,  so the  OK ,  so at each for each sub - band there are basically , uh , several measures of SNR and and correlation .  Um ,  um and he said there 's like twenty of these per per sub - band .  Um ,  and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , um , "" I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . ""  And you initialize these parameters , um , in some some way  and use EM to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors .  And then , once you get that done , you you you train the whole whole thing on maximum likelihood .  Um ,  and h he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is it 's very robust compared to , um to typical , uh , full - band Gaussian mixtures um estimations of of sonorance .  And , uh  so  so that 's just that 's just one detector .  So you can imagine building many of these detectors on different features .

Bro010.F,"Ri  Yeah ,  OK ,  so , um ,  we 're interested in , um , methods for far mike speech recognition ,  um , mainly , uh , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal .

Bro011.A,"Am I on ?  I guess so .  Radio two .  Hmm .  Radio two .  Wow .  People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .  So everybody everybody 's on ?  Yeah .  So y you guys had a a meeting with uh with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss .  Um  and uh somebody  eh e and uh  I guess Chuck you weren't there either ,  so the uh  Oh you were there ?  Yeah .  So everybody knows what happened except me .  OK . Maybe somebody should tell me .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ?  I forget .  Uh - huh .  Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .  So you could do a you could do a stricter one .  Maybe .  Yeah .  Was there any conclusion about that ?  I see .  Yeah .  So again this is th this is the downsampling uh of the uh the feature vector stream  and  um Yeah I guess the the uh LDA filters they were doing do have  um uh let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds  so  uh the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz .  Uh . Um .  Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two .  So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?  Oh OK .  OK .  Yeah .  Hmm - hmm .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Try try what ?  OK .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides  cuz because um  uh I was talking with Hynek about it later  and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much .  And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things  but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you  and and that and expected that they would do certain things  and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you  and they were sort of waiting for you  and and and uh we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves ,  and they just had hadn't thought of that .  So .  Uh . I mean it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue  in in uh the other  Yeah .  Then they couldn't .  I see .  Just talk more .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So there 's um  Alright .

And this machines are busy  and you 're busy  and  Yeah .  OK .  Oh .  Let 's let 's , I mean , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there there will be uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise  in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about  and that 's probably the best thing to do .  And there was that one email that said that it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there  in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something  and in addition to  They 're doing some noise removal thing ,  right ?

When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process  or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ?  Oh .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  So um I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas  like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on .

Bro011.A,"It 's not really echo but uh just um uh  taking the input from other mikes and using uh uh a uh an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech .  So .  Um what was it ,  there was there was some some some point where eh uh Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel  and I was saying something to somebody else uh which was in the background  and it was not  it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike .  Yes .  Oh you  it was you I was  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So they would like clean channels .  Uh and for that mmm uh that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out .  So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that .  So .  OK .  Right ?  Um . And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not ,  but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning .  Uh .  But that 's uh uh all that 's is a a certainly relevant uh study  and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding .  We have this problem with the overloading of the term "" feature ""  so  uh what are the variables ,  what we 're calling this one ,  what are the variables that they 're found finding useful  um  for  Right .  And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that  but uh  um  so  um  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying ,  do you ha still have that ?  Yeah .  There 's those that  uh  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on uh what "" good features "" are  and  And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from .  So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use  and do you combine them using the soft "" AND - OR "" or you do something , you know , more complicated  um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ?  The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation .  But then the other thing is to do something better  and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ?  This is the  And then tell them to talk naturally ?  Yeah , yeah .  Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements .  Yeah .  Yeah , be cool and help science .  OK .  Do you mean eh but you I mean Mar  you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ?  Yeah he 's he 's he 's at Motorola now .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So the only the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them .  And so  I don't know how complicated it is to go from there  What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them .  And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it  and it 's e but it  I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself ,  whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know , linguistics students ,  this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before  but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  And then there would it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable .  Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables .  So .  I mean the other thing you could do is boot trying to to uh get those binary variables  and take the continuous variables from uh the uh uh the data itself there ,  but I I 'm not sure  Guess you could , yeah .  Yeah .  So anyway that 's that 's uh that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  Um . Um . I mean in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at ,  it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  Um . So .  Yeah .  So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that um we 're looking at different ways that we can combine uh different kinds of of rep front - end representations um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions .  And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things  ","Um .

Bro011.A,"and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one um articulatory feature .  The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it um  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables  rather than um just assuming that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength towards uh it being this phone or that phone .  Right ?  So it so um he 's got these um uh uh  he "" AND 's "" between these different features .  It 's a soft "" AND "" , I guess  but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something  and then he "" OR 's "" across the different soft "" OR 's "" across the different uh multi - band channels .  And um the weight  yeah , the target for the training of the "" AND "" "" AND ' ed "" things is something that 's kept uh as a hidden variable ,  and is learned with EM .  Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that  which means that it 's it 's uh i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to um uh train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band .  You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure .  And we don't  We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up .  In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting .  Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .  Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant .  But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is  um I guess one way of describing would be  if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ?  Is it sonorant in that band ?  Is it sonorant in that band ?  i It 's hard to even answer that  what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant .  So  then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision .  And um uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything uh with with uh equal strength .  And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities ,  if we had uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities  and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data  then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can .  But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning  and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data  but it 's it 's not  I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this  cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands .  Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately  so that would be a little more like what he did .  Um .  But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's um setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band .  Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se .  Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target uh uh embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  uh f the forward um do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .

Probably came from the same place eighteen came from .  You know ,  so .  Uh that 's another parameter ,  right ?  that that maybe , you know , uh you really want three or nine or  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things  how much better can you make it ?

Bro011.B,"Blow into it ,  it works really well .  I was there .  With Hynek ?  Yeah .  Oh the What we talked about yesterday ?  Yeah that was actually my  I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,  and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .  What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ?  And and S Shawn , yeah .  Oh .  So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ?  I see .  Yeah .  And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .  What does what did um Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant uh detector ,  right ?  How did he  H how did he do that ?  Wh - what was his detector ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , OK .  Mm - hmm .  So how did he combine all these features ?  What what r mmm classifier did he  Hmm .

I  That 's right .  You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things  and  Yeah .  Hmm !  There 's a bunch of data that l around ,  that people have done studies like that w way way back  right ?  I mean I can't remember where uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of  Yeah .  I remember there was this guy at A T - andT ,  Randolph ?  or r What was his name ?  Do you remember that guy ?  Um , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features .  I can't remember what his name was .  Dang .  Now I 'll think of it .  That 's interesting .  Mark Randolph .  Oh is he ?  Oh OK .  Yeah .  I can't remember exactly what he was using , now .  But I know I just remember it had to do with you know uh positional parameters  and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ?  Bin them up into different categories and  So you 're talking about using that data to get  uh  instead of using canonical mappings of phones .  So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ?  I see .  Hmm .  So he doesn't have  Mm - hmm .  So he doesn't have to have truth marks  or Ho  Mm - hmm .  OK .  I see .  So where did he get his uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?  OK .  Using TIMIT ?  or using  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .  I um  Huh ?  Yes , I 'm playing .  Um so I wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task  and see how that affects things .  And so I had this um I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment ,  this matrix where I would take the um the original um the original system .  So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features  and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again .  So look at the difference there  and then uh do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end .  This is  that I looked at ?  Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .  So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK system for the Italian data  and got the same results that um that uh Stephane had .  So um I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to uh to improve it .  So .  One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models  and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits  and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone  and um so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three .  And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen .  Um . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null  so when they use uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states .  They 've got those initial and final null states .  ","So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ?  that people have done studies like that w way way back  I mean I can't remember where uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of  Um , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features .

Bro011.B,"And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits ,  the four and five which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .  And so they had sixteen .  So that 's pretty close .  Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter .  So the majority of them wanna have nine states .  And so theirs are s sort of twice as long .  So my guess uh  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case ,  and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best .  So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits  and a fixed length model for all of them  but the actual words for some of them are half as long  you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models .  Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , uh you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,  but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .  So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians .  So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .  And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up uh th you know , the model for "" one "" , which wants to have nine states , you know ,  what is the uh what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ?  And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix  and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that  and  so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,  you know , the long ones versus the short ones .  I d I did  quickly , I did the silence model  and and um  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration  and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits .  Yeah , yeah .  And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet ,  but um .  So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end .  And so .  I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are .  Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .  So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot  and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  um It doesn't require its own training data ,  it just shares that state .  So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up ,  but um  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more .  I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models  and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of  just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point ,  and that was th um the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state .  So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models .  And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated .  So in fact what we may want are simpler models .  And compare how they perform to that .  But you know , it depends on what the actual application is  and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah , yeah .  ","And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits ,  Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter .  So the majority of them wanna have nine states .  And so theirs are s sort of twice as long .  and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best .  So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .  Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .  ",
Bro011.B,"Well one thing I mean , if I if if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .

Bro011.C,"Uh - oh .  Radio four .  Mmm .  Oh yeah .  Alright .  Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .  So .  Yeah .  About the um , well the downsampling problem .  Uh and about the f the length of the filters  and  Yeah .  So we had  So the fact that there there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling .  Well .  There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best  w m  Well .

So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays .  Um . We started to work with this .  Mmm .  And the third point um was the um ,  yeah , the on - line normalization where ,  well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay  and that 's not taken into account right now .

So try to um um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .  Mmm .  And this we 've not uh worked on this yet .  Um , yeah .  And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like  well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response  and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot . compared to the to the uh standard RASTA filter .  Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it ,  yeah , it removed this mean .  Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  I mean , uh the the mean normalization and  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  So basically that was that 's all we discussed about .  We discussed about good things to do  also uh well , generally good stuff to do for the research .  And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS ,  so .

Bro012.A,"OK , so uh had some interesting mail from uh Dan Ellis .  Actually , I think he he redirected it to everybody also  so uh the PDA mikes uh have a big bunch of energy at at uh five hertz  uh  where this came up was that uh I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web  and and uh I just sort of hadn't noticed this , but that the major , major component in the wave in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner .  So .  So .  I I have to be more careful about using that as a as a as a good illustration ,  uh , in fact it 's not , of uh of the effects of room reverberation .  It is isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise . on on uh some mikes  uh but  So .  And then we had this other discussion about um whether this affects the dynamic range ,  cuz I know , although we start off with thirty two bits , you end up with uh sixteen bits  and you know , are we getting hurt there ?  But uh Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that that quantization error is not is still not a significant factor there .  So .  So there was a question of whether we should change things here ,  whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that  or whether we should  Right .  But then I had some other uh thing discussions with him  and the feeling was once we start monk monkeying with that , uh , many other problems could ha happen .  And additionally we we already have a lot of data that 's been collected with that ,  so .  A simple thing to do is  he he he has a I forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail ,  but he has a a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested .  We just run over the data before we deal with it .  um The other thing that I don't know the answer to , but when people are using Feacalc here , uh whether they 're using it with the high - pass filter option or not .  And I don't know if anybody knows .  But .  Yeah .  So when we 're doing all these things using our software there is  um if it 's if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program , which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP um then uh there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which um allows you to do high - pass filtering  and in general we like to do that , because of things like this  and it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe  filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies ,  even pretty low speech frequencies , at all ,  but it 's  Oh .  I don't know  I wrote this a while ago  Something like that .  Yeah .  I mean I think there 's some effect above twenty  but it 's it 's it 's it 's mild .  So , I mean it probably there 's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it 's it 's pretty mild .  I don't know in the in the STRUT implementation of the stuff is there a high - pass filter or a pre pre - emphasis or something in the  So . We we we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D  A mike for . uh He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes  so we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other  but if we do make use of the cheap mikes , uh we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process it .  And then again if it 's  uh depending on the option that the our our software is being run with , it 's it 's quite possible that 's already being taken care of .  uh But I also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation .  uh  uh No .  Well .  uh  Well . If they made output  they were they were , you know they were nice .  But . I mean the thing is it was  since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match ,  but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes .  uh It 's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it 's a noise that we definitely know what to do .  So , I mean , it doesn't take deep a new bold new methods to get rid of uh five hertz noise ,  so .  um uh But .  So it was it was a bad example in that way ,  but it 's it still is it 's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance ,  so it wasn't it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate .  So . So uh , but uh ,  Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went "" oh , man .  Why didn't I notice that ? ""  um . So . um  So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ .

Bro012.A,"one was , that spectrogram that we show is O K ,  but the thing is the eyes uh and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns from from noise that in first glance  you look at them it doesn't seem like it 's that bad  uh because there 's many features that are still preserved .  So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec uh of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different ,  an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's just to show as well .  You know .  i i Some things are going to be hurt .  um Another , I was thinking of was um taking some spectral slices ,  like uh like we look at with the recognizer ,  and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there ,  and the the uh , um , the reverberation uh does make it does change that .  And so maybe maybe that would be more obvious .  Yeah .  Well , I mean um all the recognizers look at frames .  So they they look at  Yeah , look at a  So it 's ,  yeah ,  at one point in time or uh twenty over twenty milliseconds or something , you have a spectrum or a cepstrum .  That 's what I meant by a slice .  Yeah .  And if you look at  Right . Well , that 's why I saying  either Well , either spectrum or cepstrum  but but I think the thing is you wanna  Oh . I see .  Oh .  That would be lovely ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Or I could just add them up and get a different total .  OK .  Uh . What else wh what 's what else is going on ?  Uh . I guess cuz we haven't wanted to move it .  We we could we could move us ,  and .  But it 's not wer worse  and it 's better better latency ,  right ?  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Well , the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets , if if it was  Right . So this was Italian ,  right ?  So then if you take your changes  and then  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  A tenth of a per cent .  Oh !  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ?  Are they supposed to be point five or point six ?  Point It 's supposed to be point six .  But not allowed ?  Yeah . OK .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Well . Yes .  So .  And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually .  Yeah . Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have  uh  Yeah , easily four times as many parameters .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Sorry .  So um , how 's it going on the  So . You you did some things .  They didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you 'd substantially improved anything .  But they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency ,  right ?  Uh - huh .  So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ?  So  OK .  So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent .  OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this .  Is that what you 're saying ?  Yes .  OK .  But yeah that 's that 's it 's the notion of relative improvement .  Word error rate .  Yeah .  Yeah .  No .  That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and and not not at at accuracies .  It 's  I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through .  It 's just  Yeah  but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different .  If you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent ,  five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference ,  but five over ten is is big .  So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important .  Um .  Um .  What 's a little bit ?  Like  Yeah .  Yeah , it was actually updated .  Uh . Jeff updated it some years ago  and and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it .  So .  Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different  but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous , as I recall .  Worse .  Out of what ?  I mean . s  Uh - huh .  So that 's six six point th  Yeah .  OK , so we are getting hurt somewhat .  And is that  wh what  do you know what piece  you 've done several changes here .  Uh ,  do you know what pie  Well , yeah .  But OK , so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case  Uh . Do the does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ?  ","um Another , I was thinking of was um taking some spectral slices ,  and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there ,  Well , I mean um all the recognizers look at frames .  at one point in time or uh twenty over twenty milliseconds or something , you have a spectrum or a cepstrum .  But it 's not wer worse  and it 's better better latency ,  Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ?  And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually .  So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ?  So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent .  OK .

Bro012.A,"Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something .  No .  OK , so um I guess the argument one might make is that , "" Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh you 're not quite sure what to make of it .  But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some some pattern ,  um  I mean , so eh h here 's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , then you 're probably hurting things , I would say .  So um I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with .  So I guess the question is if you can do better than this .  If you can if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down .  Uh , so .  Um . What I was asking , though , is uh are what 's what 's the level of communication with uh the O G I gang now , about this  and  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control ?  I see .  Yeah .

Oh !  Oh , a special dispensation .  That 's great .  Aalborg  Aalborg  uh  So the deadline  When 's the deadline ?  When 's the deadline ?  That 's great !  It 's great .  So we should definitely get something in for that .  But on meeting digits , maybe there 's  Maybe .  Maybe .  Yeah .  Yeah . So , I mean , I I think that you could certainly start looking at at the issue  uh but but uh I think it 's probably , on s from what Stephane is saying , it 's it 's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they 've  Mm - hmm .  Good .  Yeah .  Dave , the other thing , actually , is is this business about this wave form .  Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page ,  cuz  uh the uh um  I mean , actually the the  uh  It made a good good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the the the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and only hear  Yeah .  No , I mean , it sound it sounds pretty reverberant ,  but I mean you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room , nobody can hear that difference really .  They hear that it 's lower amplitude and they hear there 's a second voice ,  um but uh  that actually that makes for a perfectly good demo  because that 's a real obvious thing , that you hear two voices .  Yeah .  Well that that that 's OK .  But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have uh uh , you know , the spectrogram again ,  because you 're you 're you 're visual uh abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out  you know , you you look at the good one , you look at the cru the screwed up one , and and you can see the features in it without trying to @ @  yeah .  Right .  But you have to you know , if you look at it closely , you see "" well , here 's a place where this one has a big formant  uh uh formant maj major formants here are are moving quite a bit . ""  And then you look in the other one and they look practically flat .  So I mean you could that 's why I was thinking , in a section like that , you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say "" Oh yeah .  This this really distorted it quite a bit . ""  Right .  Right .  But it 's it 's  uh  So .  Yeah .  So there are clearly are spectral effects .  Since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies .  But um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and uh we want to show that , in some obvious way .  The reason I put the wave forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different .  Uh . And so I thought "" Oh , this is good . ""  but I I just  uh  After after uh they were put in there I didn't really look at them anymore ,  cuz I just they were different .  So I want something that has a is a more interesting explanation for why they 're different .  Um .  Something like that .  Yeah .  ","Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something .

Bro012.A,"The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that um the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice ,  and the the the the the uh cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form .  It 's just the first  I think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in ,  or .  I I forget the reason behind it .  But it it 's um it 's the first six seconds or something of it  and it 's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in .  So we we would like to actually see the voice coming in , too , I think ,  since that 's the most obvious thing when you listen to it .  So .  Um .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Normalizes the variance .  What 's the rationale ?  Well , I mean , because everything uh If you have a system based on Gaussians , everything is based on means and variances .  So if there 's an overall reason  You know , it 's like uh if you were doing uh image processing  and in some of the pictures you were looking at , uh there was a lot of light  uh and and in some , there was low light ,  you know , you would want to adjust for that in order to compare things .  And the variance is just sort of like the next moment ,  you know ?  So uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night uh um um ten times ,  another time it went thr  I mean i is , you know , how how much how much vari  Or no .  I guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside  rather than artificial light .  So if it was a lot if more was coming from outside , then there 'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the  So every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have , especially the variances , are going to be affected by the overall variance .  And so , in principle , you if you remove that source , then , you know , you can  That 's the first order but thing ,  but then the second order is is the variances  because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B  if it just so happens that the E 's were a more you know , were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something ,  or the variation in it was larger , uh than with the B 's , then this will be give you some some bias .  So the it 's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component .  But the the uh but let me as ask ask you something .  i is if If you have a good voice activity detector , isn't isn't it gonna pull that out ?  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah . So basically you want to reduce this effect .  So you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection .  You also could do it by spect uh spectral subtraction before the variance normalization ,  right ?  So uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So it does get better even though it looks ugly .  OK .  but does this have the voice activity detection in it ?  OK .  So .  Uh - huh .  Spectral subtraction , I guess .  Can I  Mm - hmm .  Can I ask a , I mean a sort of top - level question ,  which is um "" if if most of what the OGI folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other uh spectral subtraction , why are we worrying about it ? ""  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  I mean , i the  Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other  but I 'm I 'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do ,  if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing .  Um .  That 's  Um .  Just just asking .  Uh . I mean , it 's  I don't know .  I don't know . I mean , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you 'd like it to be .  That that seems like one prominent thing .  And then uh weren't issues of of having a a second stream or something ?  That was  Was it  There was this business that , you know , we we could use up the full forty - eight hundred bits ,  and  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ?  the next uh  In June .  OK .  Yeah .  Um . Yeah , the other thing is that you saw that that mail about uh the VAD V A Ds performing quite differently ?  That that  uh  So um .  This there was this experiment of uh "" what if we just take the baseline ? ""  set uh of features ,  just mel cepstra ,  and you inc incorporate the different V A  And it looks like the the French VAD is actually uh better significantly better .  ","The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that um the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice ,  and the the the the the uh cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form .  But it it 's um it 's the first six seconds or something of it  and it 's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in .  So we we would like to actually see the voice coming in , too , I think ,  Can I ask a , I mean a sort of top - level question ,  which is um "" if if most of what the OGI folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other uh spectral subtraction , why are we worrying about it ? ""  Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other  but I 'm I 'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do ,  if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing .

Bro012.A,"Yeah .  Yeah .  Yes .  And on that one , uh the French one is was better .  It was just better .  I mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually .  So . Uh .  So if they have a better one , we should use it .  I mean .  You know ?  it 's  you can't work on everything .  Uh . Uh . Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next ,  back back in the country .  So .  And start start organizing uh more visits and connections and so forth ,  and  uh  working towards June .  Right .  No use of pitch uh basically .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , it  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah , you can make these mistakes ,  but but  Well , I think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced , though ,  right ?  So , not the speech - nonspeech .  Yeah .  Well .  Uh yeah . B We should let him finish what he w he was gonna say ,  and  U  So u s u  OK .  So So many tell you something about that .  Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise .  So what he was doing is basically y you you do estimate the pitch .  And  um  you from that you you estimate  or you estimate fine harmonic structure ,  whichev  ei either way ,  it 's more or less the same .  But uh the thing is that um you then can get rid of things that are not  i if there is strong harmonic structure , you can throw away stuff that 's that 's non - harmonic .  And that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise  So um that 's something that is sort of finer ,  brings in a little more information than just spectral subtraction .  Um .  And he had some I mean , he did that sort of in combination with RASTA .  It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff  and he was  and and got some some decent results doing that .  So that that 's another another way .  But yeah , there 's there 's  Right .  There 's all these cues .  We 've  actually back when Chuck was here we did some voiced - unvoiced uh classification using a bunch of these ,  and and  uh  works OK .  Obviously it 's not perfect  but  um  But the thing is that you can't  given the constraints of this task , we can't , in a very nice way , feed forward to the recognizer the information  the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it 's voiced or unvoiced ,  where w we can't you know affect the the uh distributions or anything .  But we what we  uh  I guess we could  Yeah .  That But  OK .  So that 's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector .  So we 're talking about something a little different .  Right ?  I guess what you could do , maybe  this would be w useful , if if you have if you view the second stream ,  yeah , before you before you do KLT 's and so forth ,  if you do view it as probabilities ,  and if it 's an independent  So , if it 's if it 's uh not so much envelope - based by fine - structure - based ,  uh looking at harmonicity or something like that ,  um if you get a probability from that information  and then multiply it by you know , multiply by all the voiced outputs and all the unvoiced outputs ,  you know , then use that as the  uh take the log of that  or uh pre pre uh pre - nonlinearity ,  uh and do the KLT on the on on that ,  then that would that would I guess be uh a reasonable use of independent information .  So maybe that 's what you meant .  And then that would be  R Right . So you have a second neural net .  It could be pretty small .  Yeah . If you have a tandem system  and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net  we used we d did some of this stuff .  Uh I I did , some years ago ,  and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that 's different  as you say , it 's more fine - structure - based than than envelope - based  uh so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one ,  and uh then you only use for this one distinction .  And and so now you 've got a probability of the cases ,  and you 've got uh the probability of the finer uh categories on the other side .  You multiply them where appropriate  and  uh um  if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors  and roughly independent errors ,  and it 's a good choice for  Uh .  Yeah , that 's a good idea .  Yeah .  Right .  Or if you do a spectral subtraction do some spectral subtraction first  and then do some on - line normalization  then do some more spectral subtraction  I mean , maybe maybe you can do it layers or something  so it doesn't doesn't hurt too much or something .  But it but uh , anyway I think I was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example  ","I mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually .  So if they have a better one , we should use it .  H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next ,  back back in the country .  And start start organizing uh more visits and connections and so forth ,  working towards June .  No use of pitch uh basically .  Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise .

And he had some I mean , he did that sort of in combination with RASTA .  and and got some some decent results doing that .  So that that 's another another way .  Yeah , that 's a good idea .  ",
Bro012.A,"uh I mean cuz I was already sort of suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they 're doing  In fact if you get if you go into uh a uh harmonics - related thing it 's definitely going to be different than what they 're doing  and uh uh  should have some interesting properties in noise .  Um . I know that when have people have done um sort of the obvious thing of taking uh your feature vector and adding in some variables which are pitch related  or  uh that it hasn't my impression it hasn't particularly helped .  Uh . Has not .  Yeah .  But I think uh that 's that 's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams .  And and it may not have been noisy conditions .  Yeah .  I I don't remember the example  but it was it was on some DARPA data and some years ago  and so it probably wasn't , actually  Uh - huh .  Why don't you why don't you just do it with Aurora ?  Just any i in in each in each frame  uh  Why not ?  I see .  Um .  But you could I mean you can you can align so that It 's not perfect ,  but if you if you know what was said  and  Oh .  Yeah .  I see .  Yeah .  Uh .  Yeah .  Right .  I mean in experiments that we did a long time ago  and different ta  it was probably Resource Management or something ,  um , I think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing , as I recall .  And um , so um  what that said is that , sort of , left to its own devices , like without the a strong language model and so forth , that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding  one oh  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff , we were getting more like ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing .  But that was speaker - dependent actually .  We were doing training on a particular announcer  and and getting a very good handle on the features .  And we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing  and and and uh and exhaustively searched all size subsets  and and uh for for that particular speaker and you 'd find you know the five or six features which really did well on them .  And then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error .  But that , again , was speaker - dependent with lots of feature selection  and a very complex sort of thing .  So I would I would believe that uh it was quite likely that  um  looking at envelope only , that we 'd be significantly worse than that .  Uh .  The modern ones don't do a a simple switch .  They work on the code book excitation .  Yeah they do analysis - by - synthesis .  They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best .  Yeah .  Uh .  O K .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  But what about the testing data ?  Yeah .  I mean if there 's some testing data that has has has two or three  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  OK .  So we 're gonna read some more digit strings I guess ?  Sure .  ",In fact if you get if you go into uh a uh harmonics - related thing it 's definitely going to be different than what they 're doing  should have some interesting properties in noise .  ,
Bro012.B,"OK . We 're on .  Yeah , he suggested a smaller capacitor ,  right ?  For the P D  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  What 's the cut - off frequency it used ?  Is it like twenty ?  Yeah .  Did somebody notice it during your talk ?  Huh .  Didn't say anything ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  So like one instant in time .  You could just you could just throw up , you know , uh the uh some MFCC feature vectors .  You know , one from one , one from the other , and then , you know , you can look and see how different the numbers are .  I 'm just kidding .  I don't mean a graph .  I mean the actual numbers .  Yeah .  "" See how different these sequences of numbers are ? ""  Yeah .  It 's not the square .  Yeah .  Yeah I looked at um looked at the results when Stephane did that  and it 's it 's really wo really happens .  I mean th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent  and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate .  Yeah .  From point  I I 'm sorry  f for point from You change at point one  and n not tenth of a percent , one tenth ,  alright ?  Um so from point five  so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better .  And it 's I think it 's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about uh it just being very  and I think you mentioned this in your email too  it 's just very um  you know get stuck in some local minimum  and this thing throws you out of it I guess .  I think you 're not allowed to  Yeah .  That 's supposed to be point six , for the self - loop .  Yeah .  But changing it to point five I think is  which gives you much better results ,  but that 's not allowed .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right . We only tested it on the the medium mismatch ,  right ?  You said on the other cases you didn't notice  I did notice uh something  Somebody , I think it was Morgan , suggested at the last meeting that I actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames .  And there are uh almost one point eight million frames of training data  and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system .  So it 's very , very few parameters compared to how much training data .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I did one quick experiment just to make sure I had everything worked out  and I just uh f for most of the um  For for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state .  And so I just did a quick experiment , where I changed it so it went to four  and um it it it didn't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases  and it had it was just barely significant for the well - matched  better .  Uh so I 'm r gonna run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state .  Mm - hmm .  And I think also just seeing what we saw uh in terms of the expected duration of the silence model ?  when we did this tweaking of the self - loop ?  The silence model expected duration was really different .  And so in the case where um it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer .  So it was like it was a better match .  I think you know if we make a better silence model I think that will help a lot too  um for a lot of these cases  so  but one one thing I I wanted to check out before I increased the um number of mixtures per state was uh in their default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations  and then they built the silence model  and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures  and they do another seven then they add mixtures  then they do a final set of seven and they quit .  Seven seems like a lot to me  and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time  I mean to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day .  And so you know in trying to run these experiments I notice , you know , it 's difficult to find machines , you know , compute the run on .  And so one of the things I did was I compiled HTK for the Linux machines  cuz we have this one from IBM that 's got like five processors in it ?  and so now I 'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we 've got you know , extra machines that we can use for compute .  And if I 'm do running an experiment right now where I 'm changing the number of iterations ? from seven to three ?  just to see how it affects the baseline system .  And so if we can get away with just doing three , we can do many more experiments more quickly .  And if it 's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations , um , you know , we should be able to get a lot more experiments done .  And so . I 'll let you know what what happens with that .  ","Yeah I looked at um looked at the results when Stephane did that  and it 's it 's really wo really happens .

Bro012.B,"But if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done .  So .  So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I increased the number of Gaussians .  So it it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ?  Yeah .  Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the on the best case ,  cuz it 's already so good ,  right ?  Well .  I mean , it 's not it 's not that different ,  right ?  I mean , just subtract the accuracy .  I mean  Oh . Oh , I see .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I see . I see .  Yeah .  That makes sense .  Hey Morgan ?  Do you remember that Signif program that we used to use for testing signi ?  Is that still valid ?  I I 've been using that .  OK .  Oh , it was .  Oh , I shoul  OK .  I should find that new one .  I just use my old one from ninety - two or whatever  OK .  Ninety - three point six four ,  right ?  is the baseline .  Yeah .  Oh . Oh .  I 'm sorry .  Ah ! OK . Ah , ah .  Sorry .  I 'm  I 'm really confused about something .  If we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ?  I mean , especially when they 're this small .  I mean .  Wow !  Already a week !  Man !  You 're right .  That 's amazing .  Mm - hmm .  Where is Eurospeech this year ?  Oh .  Well I could at least  Well , I 'm going to be out next week  but I could try to look into like this uh CVS over the web .  That seems to be a very popular way of people distributing changes and over , you know , multiple sites and things  so maybe if I can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it 's you know , as easy to do as possible  and and people don't it won't interfere with their regular work ,  then maybe that would be good .  And I think we could use it for other things around here too .  So .  Oh great .  OK .  I used it a long time ago  but it 's been a while  so maybe I can ask you some questions .  OK .  Maybe we could just like , talk into a cup .  Some good reverb .  But not of reverberation .  I noticed that in the pictures .  I thought "" hey , you know th "" I  My initial thought was "" this is not too bad ! ""  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  The main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies .  It looked like for the one that was farther away , you know , it really everything was attenuated  and  I mean that was the main visual thing that I noticed .  This is this is ,  oh , a plot of C - zero ,  the energy .  C - zero is the close talking ?  uh the close channel ?  and s channel one is the  Yeah .  This is still being a plot of C - zero ?  OK .  Can I ask um what does variance normalization do ?  w What is the effect of that ?  I mean  y Yeah .  No , I understand that ,  but I mean  No .  No , I understand what it is ,  but I mean , what does it what 's what is  uh  We  Yeah . Yeah .  Why why do it ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , OK .  Oh , OK .  Uh - huh .  I see . OK .  So would the major effect is that you 're gonna get is by normalizing the means ,  but it may help  First - order effects .  And it may help to do the variance .  OK .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  OK .  Gotcha . OK .  Sorry to interrupt .  But after you do this , after you do the variance normalization  I mean .  I don't know , it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with .  Yeah .  But for the purposes of finding the speech  You 're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech ,  right ?  Where 's th  Where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied ?  Is it applied here or a after the variance normalization ?  or  Oh .  Yeah .  Is it applied all the way back here ?  Maybe that 's why it doesn't work for channel one .  Mm - hmm .  Speech is more what ?  There also could be I mean . I can maybe see a reason f for both working on it too  if um you know , if if if you work on something else and and you 're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction  I mean it 's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module .  So it 's it 's almost like everything 's held up waiting for this one thing .  I don't know if that 's true or not ,  ","but I could try to look into like this uh CVS over the web .

",
Bro012.B,"but I could see how  Maybe that 's what you were thinking .  Improves the baseline ?  Isn't there some other  uh d  Uh , I was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather , um by looking at um , you know , uh I guess harmonics  or looking across time  Yeah .  Well even with e  uh w ah  you know , uh even with the voiced - non voiced - unvoiced  um  I thought that you or somebody was talking about  OK .  So go ahead .  Didn't the head dude send around that message ?  Yeah , I think you sent us all a copy of the message ,  where he was saying that  I I 'm not sure , exactly , what the gist of what he was saying ,  but something having to do with the voice activity detector  and that it will that people shouldn't put their own in or something .  It was gonna be a  Oh , I 'm sorry .  I I missed that .  But the problem is that their models are all word level models .  So there 's no phone models that you get alignments for .  You So you could find out where the word boundaries are  but that 's about it .  It also  Yeah , the though I think uh there was one problem with that in that , you know , we used canonical mapping  so our truth may not have really been true to the acoustics .  So .  Wow !  Can I just mention one other interesting thing ?  Um . One of the ideas that we had come up with last week for things to try to improve the system  Um .  Actually I I s we didn't I guess I wrote this in after the meeting  b but the thought I had was um looking at the language model that 's used in the HTK recognizer ,  which is basically just a big loop ,  right ?  So you it goes "" digit ""  and then that can be either go to silence or go to another digit ,  which  That model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits ,  right ?  So . I thought "" well I 'm gonna just look at the what actual digit strings do occur in the training data . ""  And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings in any of the Aurora training data .  So it 's either one , four , five , six ,  uh up to eleven ,  and then it skips  and then there 's some at sixteen .  Um . I don't know .  I didn't look at the test data yet .  So .  Yeah .  But I just thought that was a little odd ,  that there were no two or three long  Sorry .  So I I just for the heck of it , I made a little grammar which um , you know , had it 's separate path for each length digit string you could get .  So there was a one - long path  and there was a four - long and a five - long  and I tried that and it got way worse .  There were lots of deletions .  So it was you know , I I didn't have any weights of these paths  or I didn't have anything like that .  And I played with tweaking the word transition penalties a bunch ,  but I couldn't go anywhere .  But um .  I thought "" well if I only allow ""  Yeah , I guess I should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis .  Um . But .  So to do that right you 'd probably want to have allow for them all  but then have weightings and things .  So . I just thought that was a interesting thing about the data .  Yeah .  You want to go ahead , Morgan ?  ",,
Bro012.C,"Huh .  Spectral slices ?  W w what d what do you mean ?  OK .  OK .  I see .  That 's cool .  And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here ,  so .  um j  Oh .  So . I 'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I 'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  A boom .  Yeah .  Oh .

But I don't think it indicates something , really .  I don't I don't think it means that the new system is more robust  or  It 's simply the fact that  Well .  Y  Yeah . Yeah .  It 's similar for other test sets  but I mean from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system , I could change the transition probabilities for the the first HMM and it will end up to eighty - nine also .  By using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the HTK script .  So . Well . That 's  Well .  Eh uh  This really happens .  Yeah .  Even tenth of a percent ?  Well , we tried we tried point one ,  yeah .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will always give you the better results  on other test set or it  on the other training set , I mean .  Yeah .  But . I think ,  yeah .  I think the reason is ,  yeah , I not I  it was in my mail I think also , is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone .  Well , in for the mismatched case everything is um using the far microphone training and testing ,  whereas for the highly mismatched , training is done on the close microphone  so it 's it 's clean speech basically  so you don't have this problem of local minima probably  and for the well - match , it 's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone  and  Well .  So th I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Um .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But actually um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case  and we just noticed that  Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny .  It 's not a mean of word error rate .  It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate ,  it 's a weighted mean of improvements .  So .  Which means that actually the weight on the well - matched is  Well I well what what What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference  because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also .  No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement  not of the error rate .  Yeah but what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H HMK 's ,  uh like five percent uh absolute ,  and this will not affect the final score almost  Uh this will almost not affect the final score because this improvement because the improvement uh relative to the the baseline is small  Uh .  Uh improvement ?  No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,  yeah .  Sorry .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , it 's on absolute on on relative figures ,  not  So when we look at this error rate  uh  Mmm , yeah .  Mmm , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Well anyway  uh .  So .  Yeah . So it hurts a little bit on the well - match  and  yeah .  Like , it 's difficult to say  because again  um I 'm not sure I have the  um  Right .  So it 's around , like , point five .  No , point six uh percent absolute on Italian  Worse , yep .  Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four ,  and we go to ninety - four point O four .  Uh .  Oh , no , I 've ninety - four .  ","Uh . Since the last meeting we 've we 've tried to put together um the clean low - pass um downsampling , upsampling , I mean ,  Uh the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters ,  and then we have results that are not um very impressive .  Well , there is no real improvement .  It seems better when we look at the mismatched case  but I think we are like like cheated here by the th this problem  that uh in some cases when you modify slight slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere air somewhere else in the in the space , the parameters .  I don't I don't think it means that the new system is more robust  but I mean from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system , I could change the transition probabilities for the the first HMM and it will end up to eighty - nine also .  By using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the HTK script .  Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will always give you the better results  Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny .  It 's not a mean of word error rate .  It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate ,  it 's a weighted mean of improvements .  Which means that actually the weight on the well - matched is  Well I well what what What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference  because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also .  No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,  Well anyway  Yeah . So it hurts a little bit on the well - match  No , point six uh percent absolute on Italian  Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four ,  and we go to ninety - four point O four .

Bro012.F,"Oh , the baseline , you mean .  Well I don't I 'm not talking about the baseline here .  I  uh  My baseline is the submitted system .  Hmm .  Oh yeah .  For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four  and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four .  And for Spanish we are we were at ninety - five point O five  and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one .  So .  Yeah .  I guess I guess it 's it 's the filter .  Because nnn , well uh we don't have complete result ,  but the filter So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched ,  which  And ,  yeah .  And the other things , like um downsampling , upsampling , don't seem to hurt  and the new on - line normalization , neither .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah that 's th  Yeah .  I think we can be completely fooled by this thing ,  but  I don't know .  So . There is first this thing ,  and then the  yeah , I computed the um like , the confidence level on the different test sets .  And for the well - matched they are around um point six uh percent .  For the mismatched they are around like let 's say one point five percent .  And for the well - m uh HM they are also around one point five .  So .  Yeah .  But .  Uh . About the same .  It doesn't hurt .  Yeah .  No .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results .  Um .  Yeah .  For the moment , they are working on integrating the um spectral subtraction apparently from Ericsson .  Um .  Yeah .  And so .  Yeah .  We are working on our side on other things like uh also trying a sup spectral subtraction  but of of our own , I mean , another spectral substraction .  Um .  Yeah .  So I think it 's it 's OK .  It 's going  Yeah .  Well . For the moment they 're  uh everybody 's quite  um  There is this Eurospeech deadline ,  so .  Um . And .  Yeah .  But yeah .  As soon as we have something that 's significant and that 's better than than what was submitted ,  we will fix fix the system  and  But we 've not discussed it it it this yet ,  yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah .  S  Yeah we are We are trying to to do something with the Meeting Recorder digits ,  and  But yeah .  Yeah .  And the good thing is that there is this first deadline ,  and , well , some people from OGI are working on a paper for this ,  but there is also the um special session about th Aurora  which is uh which has an extended deadline .  So .  The deadline is in May .  For th  Yeah .  So f only for the experiments on Aurora .  So it it 's good ,  yeah .  It 's in Denmark .  Hmm ?  I think it 's the thirteenth of May .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So it would be for the first deadline .  Nnn .  Uh , yeah .  Yeah .  I brought some I don't know if some figures here .  Well . I start we started to work on spectral subtraction .  And um the preliminary results were very bad .  So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall uh process , which contains LDA on - line normalization .  And it hurts uh a lot .  And so we started to look at at um things like this ,  which is ,  well , it 's  Yeah .  So you have the C - zero parameters for one uh Italian utterance .  And I plotted this for two channels .  Channel zero is the close mic microphone ,  and channel one is the distant microphone .  And it 's perfectly synchronized ,  so .  And the sentence contain only one word , which is "" Due ""  And it can't clearly be seen .  Where where is it ?  Where is the word ?  So .  This is a plot of C - zero , uh when we don't use spectral substraction ,  and when there is no on - line normalization .  So .  There is just some filtering with the LDA  and and some downsampling , upsampling .  So .  Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah .  So C - zero is very clean , actually .  Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure ,  though it is not .  Which is good .  Well , the noise part is around zero  and And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization .  So .  What we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close ,  but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is  Yeah . This is still C - zero .  So it it  Yeah .  It normalized th the standard deviation .  So it  You you get an estimate of the standard deviation .  That 's  um  Yeah but .  Uh .  Mmm .  Yep .  And it and this  Yeah . Sure .  If they are good .  Yeah .  Well what it it shows is that , yeah , perhaps a good voice activity detector is is good before on - line normalization  and that 's what uh we 've already observed .  But uh ,  yeah ,  voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  ","For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four  and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four .  And for Spanish we are we were at ninety - five point O five  and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one .  but the filter So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched ,  Well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results .

So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall uh process , which contains LDA on - line normalization .  And it hurts uh a lot .  ",
Bro012.F,"So . What I notice is that , while I prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one ,  well , because you clearly see where speech is .  But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer .  And  Yeah , but here  Yeah .  Yeah .  So I think ,  yeah .  For I th I think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition .  Well , y  Yeah , but it 's not clear ,  yeah .  We  So .  Well . It 's just to  the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and MM with these two kinds of parameters .  And , well , it 's better with variance normalization .  Uh  Yeah .  Um .  But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one .  So .  Yeah .  Hmm ?  It 's applied before variance normalization .  So it 's a good thing ,  because I guess voice activity detection on this should could be worse .  It 's applied the  um on ,  yeah ,  something like this ,  yeah .  Perhaps , yeah .  So we could perhaps do just mean normalization before VAD .  Mm - hmm .  About ?  Spectral subtraction ?  It 's just uh Well it 's another  They are trying to u to use the um the Ericsson  and we 're trying to use something something else .  And .  Yeah , and also to understand what happens because  uh fff  Well . When we do spectral subtraction , actually , I think that this is the the two last figures .  Um . It seems that after spectral subtraction , speech is more emerging now uh than than before .  Well , the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is is larger .  Well , if you compare the first figure to this one  Actually the scale is not the same ,  but if you look at the the numbers um you clearly see that the difference between the C - zero of the speech and C - zero of the noise portion is larger .  Uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of C - zero .  And so if you apply variance normalization on this , it completely sc screw everything .  Well .  Um . Uh . Yeah .  So yeah .  And what they did at OGI is just uh they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction  and I think  Yeah .  I think as soon as they will try on - line normalization there will be a problem .  So yeah , we 're working on the same thing but I think  uh  with different different system  and  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , well ,  uh .  Mmm .  Yeah . But I think they '  I think we want to work on this .  They also want to work on this ,  so .  Uh . yeah .  We we will try MSG ,  but um ,  yeah .  And they are t  I think they want to work on the second stream also ,  but more with some kind of multi - band  or , well , what they call TRAP or generalized TRAP .  Um . So .  It 's uh in June .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use .  Uh . If the use the small VAD  I th I think it 's on  I think it 's easy to do better  because it doesn't work at all .  So .  I I don't know which which one .  It 's Pratibha that that did this experiment .  Um . We should ask which VAD she used .  Yeah but I it 's uh I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , so we should find out if it 's really better .  I mean if it  the compared to the small or the big network .  And perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the VAD .  Because as as you 've mentioned .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , my feeling is that um actually when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope  and um it 's  Yeah , well , not pitch ,  but to look at the um fine at the at the high re high resolution spectrum .  So . We don't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound  but  uh  Cuz I have a feeling that when we look when we look at the just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it 's voiced and unvoiced ,  if there is some  It 's it 's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency  and .  So there would be more ,  uh there is the first formant , which is the larger  and then voiced sound are more high frequencies  cuz it 's frication  and  But ,  yeah .  When you have noise there is no  um if if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for for voiced speech  and .  So .  S  So I think that it it would be good  ","It 's just uh Well it 's another  They are trying to u to use the um the Ericsson  and we 're trying to use something something else .  And what they did at OGI is just uh they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction  I think as soon as they will try on - line normalization there will be a problem .

Bro013.A,"We 're going ?  OK .  Sh - Close your door on door on the way out ?  Thanks .  Yeah .  Probably wanna get this other door , too .  OK .  So .  Um . What are we talking about today ?  Oh , yeah . That was kind of uh interesting .  The both the uh the SRI System and the oth  And for one thing that that sure shows the difference between having a lot of uh training data or not ,  uh , the uh The best kind of number we have on the English uh on near microphone only is is uh three or four percent .  And uh it 's significantly better than that , using fairly simple front - ends on on the uh uh , with the SRI system .  So I th I think that the  uh  But that 's that 's using uh a a pretty huge amount of data ,  mostly not digits , of course ,  but but then again  Well , yeah .  In fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the H M Ms whereas uh in this case we 're just using digits for training the H M  Did anybody mention about whether the the SRI system is a is is doing the digits um the wor as a word model or as uh a sub s sub - phone states ?  Yeah .  Probably .  Huh ?  Yeah .  That 's true .  OK .  It 's tha it 's that much , huh ?  Oh .  OK .  Still .  But but uh what what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should uh take  I guess that somebody 's gonna do this ,  right ?  is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system ,  right ?  Yeah .  Yeah . Because  Yeah ,  but he 's doing it with the same data , right ?  I mean so to So there 's there 's there 's two things being affected .  I mean . One is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end .  We 've been playing a number of states  uh I I don't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of Gaussians yet  but but uh ,  uh , you know .  But , yeah , so far he hadn't gotten any big improvement ,  but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small .  And um .  Well , you could do that , but I 'm saying even with it not with that part not retrained ,  just just using having the H M Ms much better H M  Yeah .  Um . But just train those H M Ms using different features ,  the features coming from our Aurora stuff .  So .  Well , yeah .  I I I 'm sorry .  What what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ?  That the  Oh .  So much worse ?  Oh .  I uh but I 'm I 'm almost certain that it it I mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data .  It it 's it 's orders of magnitude off .  But but having a huge  If if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data .  This is a modest amount of data .  So . I mean , ordinarily you would say "" well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know ""  But the thing is , if you have a huge  in other words , do word models  But if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones .  And that 's just a huge amount of training for it .  So it 's um I I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone ,  it 's really pretty clean data .  Um .  Now , some of it could be the fact that  uh  let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ?  I mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case .  It is if  Yeah .  Yeah .  Cuz this is clean data ,  and so that 's not too surprising .  But um . Uh .  So .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ?  Oh .  I see .  So in the actual TI - digits database we 're getting point eight percent ,  and here we 're getting three or four three ,  let 's see , three for this ?  Yeah .  Sure , but I mean ,  um point eight percent is something like double uh or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that .  And and also , as you point out , there 's adaptation in these numbers also .  So if you , you know , put the ad adap take the adaptation off , then it for the English - Near you get something like two percent .  And here you had , you know , something like three point four .  And I could easily see that difference coming from this huge amount of data that it was trained on .  So it 's  You know , I don't think there 's anything magical here .  It 's , you know , we used a simple HTK system with a modest amount of data .  ","Um . What are we talking about today ?

Bro013.A,"And this is a a , you know , modern uh system  uh has has a lot of nice points to it .  Um .  So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even .  So .  Yeah it it 's not that surprising .  But to me it just it just meant a practical point that um if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should uh  Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's uh , uh it seems like too large a number ,  and uh uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously .  Um .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So the three point four percent for this uh is is  uh  So why is it  It 's an interesting question though , still .  Why is why is it three point four percent for the d the digits recorded in this environment as opposed to the uh point eight percent for for for the original TI - digits database ?  Um .  Given given the same  Yeah . So ignore ignoring the the the SRI system for a moment ,  just looking at the TI - di the uh tandem system ,  if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high .  It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high ,  but it 's , you know it 's it 's high .  Um . Why is it uh four times as high , or more ?  Right ?  I mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise .  Um . And uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over .  It was not I mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  So I think they were  Bless you .  I Yeah . I think it 's it 's  So . Yes .  It 's I think it 's it 's the indication it 's harder .  Uh . Yeah and again , you know , i that 's true either way .  I mean so take a look at the uh um , the SRI results .  I mean , they 're much much better ,  but still you 're getting something like one point three percent for uh things that are same data as in T TI - digits the same same text .  Uh . And uh , I 'm sure the same same system would would get , you know , point point three or point four or something on the actual TI - digits .  So this I think , on both systems the these digits are showing up as harder .  Um .  Which I find sort of interesting cause I think this is closer to  uh I mean it 's still read .  But I still think it 's much closer to to what what people actually face , um when they 're they 're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone .  I mean . I don't think uh  I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers ,  but I don't think that uh the uh the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their digits .  I 'm I 'm I 'm sure they get  Uh , I mean , for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh uh Middle America accents and  it 's a we we it 's it 's it 's US .  it has has many people who sound in many different ways .  So .  Um .  I mean .  OK .  That was that topic .  What else we got ?  Did we end up giving up on on , any Eurospeech submissions ,  or ?  I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are are submitting something ,  but uh .  Um . Now , actually for the for the Aur - uh  we do have stuff for Aurora , right ?  Because because we have ano an extra month or something .  Yeah .  Well , that 's fine .  So th so so we have a couple a couple little things on Meeting Recorder  and we have We don't we don't have to flood it with papers .  We 're not trying to prove anything to anybody .  so .  That 's fine .  Um .  Anything else ?  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So wha where did this good VAD come from ?  This is the one they had originally ?  Oh .  Yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space ,  didn't they ?  Well . So that 's a problem .  Yeah .  But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely .  I mean , uh i if if there 's a if if  I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk  but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there  OK .  Determined .  I see .  But I was thinking that that uh s "" Sure , there may be some interaction ,  but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's VAD .  We could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller  or  You know , as long as it did the job .  So that 's good .  Right .  Yeah .  You didn't gain anything , right ?  Mm - hmm .  So that means logically , in principle , it should be better .  So probably it 'll be worse .  ","And this is a a , you know , modern uh system  uh has has a lot of nice points to it .  So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even .  But to me it just it just meant a practical point that um if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should uh  Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's uh , uh it seems like too large a number ,  and uh uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously .  I mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise .  Um . And uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over .  It was not I mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all .  So wha where did this good VAD come from ?  This is the one they had originally ?  Yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space ,  But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely .  I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk  but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there  but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's VAD .

Bro013.A,"Or in the basic perverse nature uh of reality .  Yeah .  OK .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Uh - huh .  Huh ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Uh .  Well , I 'm s uh  There 's  None of these axes are labeled ,  so I don't know what this  What 's this axis ?  Frame .  And what 's th what this ?  For this one .  For the noi  Oh .

So now I wonder  I mean , do you want to  I know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum  Um . But if you were to really try and get a voiced - unvoiced , do you do you want to totally ignore that ?  I mean , do you do you  I mean , clearly a a very big very big cues for voiced - unvoiced come from uh spectral slope and so on ,  right ?  Um .  Yeah .  I see .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , you probably want  I mean , certainly if you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features .  Each each feature is by itself not enough .  But , you know , people look at at slope and uh first auto - correlation coefficient , divided by power .  Or or uh  um  there 's uh  I guess we prob probably don't have enough computation to do a simple pitch detector or something ?  I mean with a pitch detector you could have a have a an estimate of of what the  Uh .  Or maybe you could you just do it going through the P FFT 's figuring out some um probable um harmonic structure .  Right .  And and uh .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  That 's as as a separate thing .  Yeah .  Separate thing ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Maybe so .  Um .  Yeah .  So , what  Yeah .  What I was talking about was just , starting with the FFT  you could you could uh do a very rough thing to estimate estimate uh pitch .  And uh uh , given you know , given that , uh you could uh uh come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was was explained by by uh uh those harmonics .  Uh .  It 's uh a variant on what you 're s what you 're doing .  The I mean , the the the mel does give a smooth thing .  But as you say it 's not that smooth here .  And and so if you if you just you know subtracted off uh your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so  and and our first kilohertz , even .  And um if was uh noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be  if it was if it was unvoiced or something .  So you oughta be able to pick out voiced segments .  At least it should be another another cue .  So . Anyway .  OK ?  That 's what 's going on .  Uh .  What 's up with you ?  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  OK .  Um . I think we 're sort of done .  So let 's read our digits and go home .  Yeah .  No . "" O "" "" O "" "" O ""  "" O "" "" O "" "" O "" and "" zero "" are two ways that we say that digit .  So it 's  so it 's i  No .  I mean . I think people will do what they say .  It 's OK .  I mean in digit recognition we 've done before , you have you have two pronunciations for that value , "" O "" and "" zero "" .  No , they just write  they they write down OH .  or they write down ZERO  a and they and they each have their own pronunciation .  But people wouldn't know what that wa  I mean there is no convention for it .  See . I mean , you 'd have to tell them "" OK when we write this , say it tha "" ,  you know ,  and you just They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would  and and people say it different ways .  Yes .  That 's right .  It was it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things .  That 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups .  So so it 's  Yeah .  So it 's it 's  Everything 's fine .  OK .  Actually , let me just s since since you brought it up , I was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it .

Bro013.C,"Yeah .  OK .  And  um  so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work  and um  uh I 'll try to write up in my next stat status report a nice description of what he 's doing ,  but it 's it 's an approach to deal with reverberation or that the aspect of his work that I 'm interested in  the idea is that um normally an analysis frames are um too short to encompass reverberation effects um in full .  You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window  and so you you 'd like it to be that um the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in ,  but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames  cuz you j  But if you take , say , a two millisecond um window  I 'm sorry  a two second window  then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response is included in the window  and the then it um then things are l more linear .  It is it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved  and um and you can use channel normalization techniques like  uh in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed .  He just does um mean subtraction ,  which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum  and that 's supposed to d um deal uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation  and um the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer  um so he does this um method training trading the um the spectral resolution for time resolution and um come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um frequency resolution .  So I don't really know the theory .  I guess it 's these are called "" time frequency representations ""  and h he 's making the the time sh um finer grained and the frequency resolution um less fine grained .  s so I 'm I guess my first stab actually in continuing his work is to um re - implement this this thing which um changes the time and frequency resolutions  cuz he doesn't have code for me .

Bro013.E,"But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine .  And . So we can  Yeah but  nnn .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and VAD or frame dropping  But they still want to just to give some um requirement for this VAD  because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard .  So . So it must be at least uh somewhat fixed but not completely .  So there just will be some requirements that are still not uh not yet uh ready I think .  Nnn .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Uh . So there is this thing .  There is  um  Yeah .  Uh I designed a new a new filter  because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds  and uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s  I think it 's sixty - five .  Yeah .  Both should have sixty - five because  Yeah .  And . So I did that  and uh it 's running .  So , let 's see what will happen .  Uh but the filter is of course closer to the reference filter .  Mmm .  Um . Yeah .  I think  Yeah  Yeah .  Sure .  Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of um voiced - unvoiced stuff .  And next week I think we will perhaps try to have um a new system with uh uh MSG stream also  see what what happens .  So , something that 's similar to the proposal too , but with MSG stream .  Mmm .  Yeah .  So , basically we wa want to look at something like the ex the ex excitation signal and  which are the variance of it and  Mmm .  Yeah .  I think the lower one is noise .  Yeah .  So this should the the the t voiced portions .  The p the peaks should be voiced portion .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .

But  Yeah , but it 's not  it 's ,  yeah , it 's it 's another problem .  Yeah  Um .  Yeah , there is th this fact actually .  If you look at this um spectrum ,  What 's this again ?  Is it the mel - filters ?  Yeah .  OK .  So the envelope here is the output of the mel - filters  and what we clearly see is that in some cases ,  and it clearly appears here ,  and the the harmonics are resolved by the f  Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering ,  and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch .  It 's around one hundred , one hundred and fifty hertz Nnn .  And so what happens is that this uh , add additional variability to this envelope  and um  so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies .  i  Yeah .  This is a separate thing .  And .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  There are only zeros here .  Well .

But it 's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then , if  because here you only have zeros  and and people pronounce "" O "" or zero  Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the "" O "" .  OK .  Yeah .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah , it was orthographic ,  so .  ","But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine .  They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and VAD or frame dropping  But they still want to just to give some um requirement for this VAD  because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard .  So there just will be some requirements that are still not uh not yet uh ready I think .  Uh I designed a new a new filter  because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds  and uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s  Both should have sixty - five because  and uh it 's running .  Uh but the filter is of course closer to the reference filter .  Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of um voiced - unvoiced stuff .  So , basically we wa want to look at something like the ex the ex excitation signal and  which are the variance of it and  Well , this would be this would be perhaps an additional parameter ,  yeah , it 's it 's another problem .  If you look at this um spectrum ,  Is it the mel - filters ?  and what we clearly see is that in some cases ,  and the the harmonics are resolved by the f  Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering ,  and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch .  so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies .

Mmm , I just  Yeah .  Um ,  yeah .  So the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates that are obtained from different language and and conditions .

Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on  uh  well , to to combine error rates before computing improvement .  Uh , and the fact is that for right now for the English , they have weights  they they combine error rates ,  but for the other languages they combine improvement .  So it 's not very consistent .  Um  Yeah .  The , um  Yeah .  And so  Well , this is a point .  And right now actually there is a thing also , uh , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number .  And so , perhaps they will change the weights to  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  In  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Tha - that 's what they do .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .

When when you combine error rate it tends to give more importance to the difficult cases ,  and some people think that  well , they have different , um , opinions about this .  Some people think that it 's more important to look at to have ten percent imp relative improvement on well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched ,  and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch  and  So , bu  l de fff !

Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Uh , so  Yeah .

And apparently , uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number .  So they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline ,  but w which would be a much better baseline .  And if we look at the result that Sunil sent , just putting the VAD in the baseline improved , like , more than twenty percent ,  which would mean then then mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like , well , more than sixty percent improvement on  on o e e uh  Right now , nobody would be there ,  but  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Uh , they didn't decide yet .  I guess i this was one point of the conference call also ,  but  mmm ,  so I don't know .  Um ,  but  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  M  Yeah .  But I guess perhaps  I don't know  w Yeah .  Uh , yeah .  Per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because the , um to make a good VAD you don't have enough to with the the features that are the baseline features .

Bro014.A,"So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization ,  so which is similar to the pro proposal - one , but with spectral subtraction in addition ,  and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further when you have spectral subtraction .  I  I have no idea ,  because the issue I brought up was with a very simple spectral subtraction approach ,  and the one that they use at OGI is one from from the proposed the the the Aurora prop uh , proposals ,  which might be much better .  So , yeah .  I asked Sunil for more information about that ,  but , uh ,  I don't know yet .  Um .  And what 's happened here is that we  so we have this kind of new , um , reference system which use a nice a a clean downsampling - upsampling ,  which use a new filter that 's much shorter  and which also cuts the frequency below sixty - four hertz ,  which was not done on our first proposal .

Um , it seems to improve on the well - matched case ,  um , but it 's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly - mismatched  I mean when we put the neural network .

So .  Yeah , I don't know . I I j uh , uh pr  Latency is short  is  Yeah .  And so  Yeah .  Mainly because of the sixty - four hertz and the good VAD .

Uh  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Probably , yeah .  Um  So , yeah .  Uh .  Yeah , but it 's a good thing anyway to have shorter delay .

Bro014.A,"Yeah , but ther more obvious is that  Yeah .  The the more obvious is that that  well , using the th the FFT , um , you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly , I mean .

Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Um , we just  How did we do it up again ?  Mm - hmm .  S  Yeah . I think we have linear interpolation .  So we have we have one point for one energy for each filter bank ,  which is the energy that 's centered on on on the triangle  Yeah .  That 's right .  Then we compute the difference .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  So .  And I think the variance is computed only from , like , two hundred hertz to one to fifteen hundred .  Because  Fifteen hundred .  Because  Yeah .  Above , um it seems that  Well , some voiced sound can have also , like , a noisy part on high frequencies ,  and  But  Well , it 's just  So this is  Yeah .  In log domain .  Yeah .  Uh , yeah .  So .  Yeah .  What happen if what we have have what we would like to have is some spectrum of the excitation signal ,  which is for voiced sound ideally  a a pulse train  and for unvoiced it 's something that 's more flat .  And the way to do this is that  well , we have the we have the FFT because it 's computed in in the in the system ,  and we have the mel filter banks ,  and so if we if we , like , remove the mel filter bank from the FFT , we have something that 's close to the excitation signal .  It 's something that 's like a a a train of p a pulse train for voiced sound  and that 's that should be flat for  So - It 's Y  yeah .  You have several some unvoiced ?  Oh .  But  Yeah .  This is another voiced example .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  This is  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So , of course , it 's around zero ,  but  Well ,  no .  It is  So it 's  Yeah .  It 's the pitch .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Do you have the mean  do you have the mean for the auto - correlation ?  Well , I mean for the the energy .  They should be more close .  Yeah .  So they are  this is there is less difference .  This is less it 's less robust .  Oh , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  But  Yeah . Well .  Mm - hmm .  It seems ,  yeah .  Um ,  No , no , no .  But th the kind of robustness to noise  So if if you take this frame , uh , from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance  Y y y yeah .  We end up with  Yeah .  Yeah ,  that 's  Yeah .  This is kind of inter interesting also  because if we use the standard , uh , frame length of of , like , twenty - five milliseconds , um , what happens is that for low - pitched voiced , because of the frame length , y you don't really have you don't clearly see this periodic structure ,  because of the first lobe of of each each of the harmonics .  So , this is like yeah , fifty milliseconds or something like that .  Yeah , but it 's the same frame  and  Yeah .  So , yeah .  I see that .  Oh , yeah .  Yeah .  So with a short frame basically you have only two periods  and it 's not not enough to to have this kind of neat things .  But  Yeah .  So probably we 'll have to use , like , long f long frames .

It depends what you wanna show .  Each each one is gonna have a different characteristic .  So  Well , they are doing that .  No , that is relative .  But the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ?  And the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings .  It 's a weighted average .  Um .  Well , that 's what he 's seeing as one of the things they could do .  It 's just when you when you get all done , I think that they pro  I m I I wasn't there  but I think they started off this process with the notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard .  And , um ,  so they said "" how much is significantly better ?  what do you ? ""  And and so they said "" well , you know , you should have half the errors , "" or something , "" that you had before "" .  So it 's ,  uh ,  But it does seem like  i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first  and then do the  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah ?  Well , you know , the the thing is that if you look at the numbers on the on the more difficult cases , um , if you really believe that was gonna be the predominant use , none of this would be good enough .  Nothing anybody 's  whereas you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases that these these systems working .  So ,  um ,  I think the hope would be that it would uh , it would work well for the good cases  and , uh , it would have reasonable reas soft degradation as you got to worse and worse conditions .  Um .  But but No .  Well , no  well , no .  I mean , it isn't the operating theater .  I mean , they don they they don't they don't really know , I think .  I mean , I th  Well , I mean , I I think one thing to do is to just not rely on a single number  to maybe have two or three numbers ,  you know ,  and and and say here 's how much you , uh you improve the , uh the the relatively clean case  and here 's  or or well - matched case ,  and here 's how here 's how much you ,  uh  So .  Yeah .  Uh , actually it 's true .  Uh , I had forgotten this ,  uh , but , uh , well - matched is not actually clean .  What it is is just that ,  u uh , the training and testing are similar .  So ,  I guess what you would do in practice is you 'd try to get as many , uh , examples of similar sort of stuff as you could ,  and then ,  uh  So the argument for that being the the the more important thing , is that you 're gonna try and do that , but you wanna see how badly it deviates from that when when when the , uh it 's a little different .  Um ,  But  No .  ","And then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's  Yeah .

",
Bro014.B,"That 's a that 's a that 's an arg  that 's an ar  Well , that 's an argument for it ,  but let me give you the opposite argument .  The opposite argument is you 're never really gonna have a good sample of all these different things .  I mean , are you gonna have w uh , uh , examples with the windows open ,  half open ,  full open ?  Going seventy , sixty , fifty , forty miles an hour ?  On what kind of roads ?  With what passing you ?  With  uh , I mean ,  I I I think that you could make the opposite argument that the well - matched case is a fantasy .  You know ,  so ,  I think the thing is is that if you look at the well - matched case versus the po you know , the the medium and the and the fo and then the mismatched case , um , we 're seeing really , really big differences in performance .  Right ?  And and y you wouldn't like that to be the case .  You wouldn't like that as soon as you step outside  You know , a lot of the the cases it 's is  I mean , in these cases , if you go from the the , uh  I mean , I don't remember the numbers right off ,  but if you if you go from the well - matched case to the medium , it 's not an enormous difference in the in the the training - testing situation ,  and and and it 's a really big performance drop .  You know ,  so ,  um  Yeah , I mean the reference one , for instance this is back old on , uh on Italian uh , was like six percent error for the well - matched  and eighteen for the medium - matched  and sixty for the for highly - mismatched .  Uh ,  and , you know , with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit ,  but still there 's there 's something like a factor of two or something between well - matched and medium - matched .  And so I think that if what you 're if the goal of this is to come up with robust features , it does mean  So you could argue , in fact , that the well - matched is something you shouldn't be looking at at all ,  that that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance ,  you know , with again gentle degregra degradation ,  um , even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training .  So , you know , I I could argue strongly that something like the medium mismatch , which is you know not compl pathological but  I mean , what was the the medium - mismatch condition again ?  Right .  So it 's still the same same microphone in both cases ,  but , uh , it 's there 's a mismatch between the car conditions .  And that 's  uh , you could argue that 's a pretty realistic situation  and , uh , I 'd almost argue for weighting that highest .  But the way they have it now , it 's I guess it 's it 's  They they compute the relative improvement first  and then average that with a weighting ?  And so then the that that makes the highly - matched the really big thing .  Um ,  so , u i since they have these three categories , it seems like the reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those .  Just say "" OK , in the in the highly - matched case this is what happens ,  in the m the , uh this other m medium if this happens ,  in the highly - mismatched that happens "" .  And , uh ,  you should see , uh , a gentle degradation through that .  Um .  But  I don't know .  I think that that  I I  I gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change  because everybody has has , uh , their own opinion  and  I don't know .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So nobody would be there , probably . Right ?  Good .  Work to do .  So whose VAD  is Is is this a ?  Oh , I I think th that would be good .  I mean , it 's not that the design of the VAD isn't important ,  but it 's just that it it it does seem to be i uh , a lot of work to do a good job on on that  and as well as being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature design ,  so  if we can cut down on that maybe we can make some progress .  Yeah .  Um ,  sure .  But i  bu  So y so you  m s Yeah ,  but  Well , let 's say for ins  see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch .  So just just for example .  So suppose you 've that what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there  and if it gets an unambiguous  if it gets an unambiguous result then you 're definitely in a in a in a voice in a , uh , s region with speech .

I gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change  because everybody has has , uh , their own opinion  So whose VAD  ",
Bro014.B,"What is it that you 're supposed to do better than ?  And so  having the baseline be the MFCC 's means that people could choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good VAD  or tryi  They 're sort of separate .  Unfortunately there 's coupling between them ,  which is part of what I think Stephane is getting to , is that you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the VAD .  And you also can choose your features in such a way as to prove improve recognition .  They may not be the same thing .  You should do both  and and I I think that this still makes I still think this makes sense as a baseline .  It 's just saying , as a baseline , we know  you know , we had the MFCC 's before ,  lots of people have done voice activity detectors ,  you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline ,  just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline .  And then let 's try and make everything better .  Um ,  and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the VAD then that 's so be it .  But ,  uh , uh , uh , at least you have a starting point that 's  um ,  cuz i i some of the some of the people didn't have a VAD at all , I guess .  Right ?  And and  then they they looked pretty bad  and and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all .  But ,  um .  Yeah .  I mean , it seems like ,  uh ,  it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want are trying to improve ,  and MFCC 's , you know , or PLP or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the features ,  and anybody doing this task , uh , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way .  They might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing ,  but but they 'll have it on some level .  So ,  um .  Well , I think people just had  it wasn't that they purposely brain - damaged it .  I think people hadn't really thought through about the , uh the VAD issue .  And and then when the the the proposals actually came in and half of them had V A Ds and half of them didn't ,  and the half that did did well  and the half that didn't did poorly .  So it 's  Uh .  Right .  When you say "" we have that "" , does Sunil have it now , too ,  or ?  OK .  OK .  But how much worse since the weighting might change  how how much worse is it on the other conditions ,  when you say it 's a little worse ?  OK .  Um .  But it has the , uh  the latencies are much shorter .  That 's  Uh - huh .  But the latencies  but you 've got the latency shorter now .  Yeah .  So it 's better than the system that we had before .  OK .  OK .  So that 's that 's all fine .  But what you 're saying is that when you do these  So let me try to understand .  When when you do these same improvements to proposal - one ,  that , uh , on the i  things are somewhat better , uh , in proposal - two for the well - matched case  and somewhat worse for the other two cases .  So does , uh  when you say , uh  So  The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ?  I get it .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  There was a start of some effort on something related to voicing or something .  Is that ?  OK .  Yeah , w  what yo what you 're calling the excitation , as I recall , is you 're subtracting the the , um the mel mel mel filter , uh , spectrum from the FFT spectrum .  Right .  So it 's it 's not really an excitation ,  but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well , yeah , except the variance was big .  Right ?  Yeah .  But another way of looking at it might be that  I mean , what w we we are coming up with feature sets after all .  So another way of looking at it is that um , the mel cepstru mel spectrum , mel cepstrum , any of these variants , um , give you the smooth spectrum .  It 's the spectral envelope .  By going back to the FFT , you 're getting something that is more like the raw data .  So the question is , what characterization  and you 're playing around with this  another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you 're missing that could help ?

"
Bro014.B,"the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier ,  but it 's more that , you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data  and and  m maybe there 's something there that the system can use .  Yeah .  Well , that 's the rea  w w what I 'm arguing is that 's  Yeah .  I mean , uh , what I 'm arguing is that that that 's givi you gives you your intuition .  But in in reality , it 's you know , there 's all of this this overlap and so forth ,  and But what I 'm saying is that may be OK ,  because what you 're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced ,  both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then , uh , th you know , structural reasons ,  uh , uh , like the one that Chuck said ,  that that in fact , well , the data itself is that you 're working with is not perfect .  So , what I 'm saying is maybe that 's not a killer  because you 're just getting some characterization ,  one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly ,  but it 's just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version .  And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of , uh , statistical characterizations of , um , what 's missing from the spectral envelope .  Um , obviously you have something about the excitation ,  um ,  and what is it about the excitation ,  and , you know and you 're not getting the excitation anyway , you know .  So  so I I would almost take a  uh , especially if if these trainings and so forth are faster , I would almost just take a uh , a scattershot at a few different ways of look of characterizing that difference  and , uh , you could have one of them but and and see , you know , which of them helps .  But each one of the mixture components  I mean , you have , uh , uh , variance only ,  so it 's kind of like you 're just multiplying together these , um , probabilities from the individual features within each mixture .  So it 's  so ,  uh ,  it seems l you know  Yeah .  Um .  Yeah .  I mean , I know that , um , people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the FFT  and actually it wasn't wasn't wasn't so bad .  Uh , so it would s  and and you know that i it 's gotta hurt you a little bit to not have a a spectral , uh a s a smooth spectral envelope ,  so there must be something else that you get in return for that  that , uh  uh  So .  So you essentially take the values that th that you get from the triangular filter and extend them  to sor sort of like a rectangle , that 's at that m value .  Oh .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah .  No , it 's makes sense to look at low frequencies .  Right .  So i so i i this is  I mean , i you could argue about whether it should be linear interpolation or or or or zeroeth order ,  but but  at any rate something like this is what you 're feeding your recognizer , typically .  No .  Uh , so the mel cepstrum is the is the is the cepstrum of this this , uh , spectrum or log spectrum ,  whatever it  You - you 're subtracting in in in power domain or log domain ?  OK .  So it 's sort of like division , when you do the yeah , the spectra .  Um .  Yeah .  But , anyway ,  um  and that 's  Yeah .  I guess that makes sense .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So , you know , all  Yeah .  Yeah .  Pitch .  Yeah .  That 's like fundamental frequency .  So , I mean , i t t  I mean , to first order what you 'd what you 're doing  I mean , ignore all the details and all the ways which is that these are complete lies .  Uh , the the you know , what you 're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have , uh , in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech ,  in which you have a periodic or aperiodic source that 's driving some filters .  Uh , first order for speech recognition , you say "" I don't care about the source "" .  Right ?  And so you just want to find out what the filters are .  The filters roughly act like a , um a , uh a an overall resonant you know , f some resonances and so forth that th that 's processing excitation .  So if you look at the spectral envelope , just the very smooth properties of it , you get something closer to that .  And the notion is if you have the full spectrum , with all the little nitty - gritty details , that that has the effect of both ,  and it would be a multiplication in in frequency domain  so that would be like an addition in log power spectrum domain .  ","the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier ,  but it 's more that , you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data  that that in fact , well , the data itself is that you 're working with is not perfect .

",
Bro014.B,"And so this is saying , well , if you really do have that sort of vocal tract envelope , and you subtract that off , what you get is the excitation .  And I call that lies because you don't really have that ,  you just have some kind of signal - processing trickery to get something that 's kind of smooth .  It 's not really what 's happening in the vocal tract  so you 're not really getting the vocal excitation .  That 's why I was going to the why I was referring to it in a more a more , uh , uh , conservative way ,  when I was saying "" well , it 's  yeah ,  it 's the excitation "" .  But it 's not really the excitation .  It 's whatever it is that 's different between  So so , stand standing back from that , you sort of say there 's this very detailed representation .  You go to a smooth representation .  You go to a smooth representation cuz this typically generalizes better .  Um ,  but whenever you smooth you lose something ,  so the question is have you lost something you can you use ?  Um , probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta saying "" OK , our feature set will be the FFT "" ,  cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother ,  but maybe there 's something that we missed .  So what is it ?  And then you go back to the intuition that ,  well , you don't really get the excitation ,  but you get something related to it .  And it and as you can see from those pictures , you do get something that shows some periodicity , uh , in frequency ,  you know ,  and and and also in time .  So  so ,  Yeah .  But presumably you 'll see something that won't have this kind of , uh , uh , uh , regularity in frequency , uh , in the  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah , maybe .  Well , I mean it looks better ,  but , I mean , the thing is if if , uh if you 're actually asking you know , if you actually j uh , need to do place along an FFT , it may be it may be pushing things .  And and , uh  Hmm .  The spectral subtraction is being done  at what level ? Is it being done  at the level of FFT bins  or at the level of , uh , mel spectrum or something ?  I mean , how are they doing it ?  So in that case , it might not make much difference at all .  Maybe .  I mean , certainly it 'd be better .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  What else ?  OK .  Uh , has has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source ,  or ?  OK .  Early June ,  late June ,  middle June ?  Hmm .  OK .

Make sur make sure Carmen talks as well .  Uh , but has he pretty much been talking about what you 're doing also ,  and ?  Yes .  Yeah , well .  You know , uh , we 'll get we 'll get to , uh , Spanish voices sometime ,  and we do we want to recognize , uh , you too .  Oh , no .  We like we we 're we 're  w we are we 're in the , uh , Bourlard - Hermansky - Morgan , uh , frame of mind .  Yeah , we like high error rates .  It 's  That way there 's lots of work to do .  So it 's  Uh ,  anything to  talk about ?  Mm - hmm .  This is in order to use the SRI system or something .  Right ?  Yeah ?  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  I mean , it 's  um ,  certainly in a short short - term this just sounds easier .  Yeah .  I mean , longer - term if it 's if it turns out to be useful , one one might want to do something else ,  but  Uh , uh , I mean , in in other words , you you may be putting other kinds of errors in from the re - synthesis process .  Yeah .  Uh , it depends what you what you do .  I mean , it 's it 's it 's , uh ,  um  Don't know .  But anyway it sounds like a reasonable way to go for a for an initial thing ,  and we can look at at exactly what you end up doing  and and then figure out if there 's some something that could be be hurt by the end part of the process .  OK .  So that 's  That was it , huh ?  OK .  OK .  Um , anything to add ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Sure .  I mean , this sort of goes back to earlier stuff by Drullman .  And and , uh , the the MSG features were sort of built up with this notion  But , I guess , I thought you had brought this up in the context of , um , targets somehow .

Bro014.C,"Yes , again .  We did it again , Morgan .  Is he gonna come here ?  So when you said "" in town "" , you mean Oregon .  Oh .  I have something just fairly brief to report on .  Um , I did some experim uh , uh , just a few more experiments before I had to , uh , go away for the w well , that week .  Was it last week or whenever ?  Um ,  so what I was started playing with was the th again , this is the HTK back - end .  And , um ,  I was curious because the way that they train up the models , they go through about four sort of rounds of of training .  And in the first round they do uh , I think it 's three iterations ,  and for the last three rounds e e they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three .  And so ,  you know , that 's part of what takes so long to train the the the back - end for this .  Yeah .  Uh ,  maybe I should write it on the board .  So , there 's four rounds of training .  Um ,  I g I g I guess you could say iterations .  The first one is three , then seven , seven , and seven .  And what these numbers refer to is the number of times that the , uh , HMM re - estimation is run .  It 's this program called H E  OK .  So what happens is , um , at each one of these points , you increase the number of Gaussians in the model .  Yeah .  The mix up .  Right .  And so , in the final one here , you end up with , uh for all of the the digit words , you end up with , uh , three mixtures per state ,  eh , in the final thing .  So I had done some experiments where I was I I want to play with the number of mixtures .  But , um ,  uh , I wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iterations early on .  And so ,  um , I I ran a couple of experiments where I reduced that to l to be three , two , two , uh , five , I think ,  and I got almost the exact same results .  And but it runs much much faster .  So , um ,  I I think m it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training ,  as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ?  I mean , it takes you have to do an overnight basically , the way it is set up now .  So ,  uh ,  even we don't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster .  And when you have your final thing , we go back to this .  So , um ,  and it 's a real simple change to make .  I mean , it 's like one little text file you edit and change those numbers ,  and you don't do anything else .  And then you just run .  So it 's a very simple change to make  and it doesn't seem to hurt all that much .  So I  Uh , I I have to look to see what the exact numbers were .  I I thought was , like , three , two , two , five ,  but I I 'll I 'll double check .  It was over a week ago that I did it ,  so I can't remember exactly .  But , uh  um , but it 's so much faster .  I it makes a big difference .  So we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more stuff in there .  Um .  Oh , the other thing that I did was , um , I compiled the HTK stuff for the Linux boxes .  So we have this big thing that we got from IBM ,  which is a five - processor machine .  Really fast ,  but it 's running Linux .  So , you can now run your experiments on that machine  and you can run five at a time  and it runs , uh , as fast as , you know , uh , five different machines .  So , um ,  I 've forgotten now what the name of that machine is  but I can I can send email around about it .  And so we 've got it  now HTK 's compiled for both the Linux and for , um , the Sparcs .  Um , you have to make you have to make sure that in your dot CSHRC , um , it detects whether you 're running on the Linux or a a Sparc and points to the right executables .  Uh ,  and you may not have had that in your dot CSHRC before , if you were always just running the Sparc .  So ,  um ,  uh , I can I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work .  But it 'll it really increases what we can run on .  So , together with the fact that we 've got these faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments .  So .  So after I did that , then what I wanted to do was try increasing the number of mixtures ,  just to see , um see how how that affects performance .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Exactly .  Right .

Bro014.C,"Right .  Uh - huh .  Uh ,  let 's see ,  uh .  It goes from  this uh , try to go it backwards this at this point it 's two mixtures per state .  So this just adds one .  Except that , uh , actually for the silence model , it 's six mixtures per state .  Uh , so it goes to two .  Um .  And I think what happens here is  Yeah . I think that 's what it is .  Uh ,  yeah . It 's , uh  Shoot .  I I I can't remember now what happens at that first one .  Uh , I have to look it up and see .  Um ,  there because they start off with , uh , an initial model  which is just this global model ,  and then they split it to the individuals .  And so , it may be that that 's what 's happening here .  I I I have to look it up and see .  I I don't exactly remember .  So . That 's it .  Hmm .  How should that be done ?  I mean , it it seems like there 's a simple way  Uh , this seems like an obvious mistake or something .  Th - they 're  Mm - hmm .  Well , it seems like they should do , like , the percentage improvement or something ,  rather than the absolute improvement .  Oh .  Why don't they not look at improvements but just look at your av your scores ?  You know , figure out how to combine the scores  with a weight or whatever ,  and then give you a score  here 's your score .  And then they can do the same thing for the baseline system  and here 's its score .  And then you can look at  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  It sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is gonna be .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I I guess what I 'm  I mean , I I was thinking about it in terms of , if I were building the final product  and I was gonna test to see which front - end I 'd I wanted to use ,  I would try to weight things depending on the exact environment that I was gonna be using the system in .  If I  Yeah .  So if if they don't know , doesn't that suggest the way for them to go ?  Uh ,  you assume everything 's equal .  I mean , y y I mean , you  Yeah .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  So not  So not try to combine them .  Yeah .  The training and testing .  Yeah .  So  so you should weight those other conditions v very you know , really small .  I mean , that 's more of an information kind of thing .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , that 'll teach them to roll their window up .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Wait a minute .  I I 'm confused .  Wha - what do you mean ?  Oh ,  oh . I see .  So there 's this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the MFCC ?  Yeah .  I g  Yeah .  I don't s  But they seem like two separate issues .  Right ?  I mean  But it seems like you should do both .  Right ?  Yeah . It seems like you should try to make your baseline as good as possible .  And if it turns out that you can't improve on that , well , I mean , then , you know , nobody wins and you just use MFCC .  Right ?  It seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't , you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline ,  or  You know ?  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with the the musical tones  and ?  Mmm .  What sorts of  what sorts of features are you looking at ?  Wait a minute .  I what does that mean ?  The variance of the spectrum of excitation .  How do you know ?  How did you get your voiced and unvoiced truth data ?  Is this a a s a trained system ?  Or is it a system where you just pick some thresholds ?  Ho - how does it work ?  Mm - hmm .  Because it seems like what you said about the mean of the the voiced and the unvoiced that seemed pretty encouraging .  Right ?  Well , y  Well , y I I don't know that I would trust that so much  because you 're doing these canonical mappings from TIMIT labellings .  Right ?  So ,  really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced .  So that could be giving you a lot of variance .  I mean ,  i it it may be that that you 're finding something good  and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you 're getting your truth .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  So i is the idea that you 're going to take whatever features you develop and and just add them onto the future vector ?  Or , what 's the use of the the voiced - unvoiced detector ?  It 's not part of a VAD system that you 're doing ?  Oh ,  OK .  Features .  I see .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I think it 's a neat thing .  Uh , it seems like a good idea .

Bro014.C,"uh , maybe I 'm going in too much detail ,  but how exactly do you make the difference between the FFT and the smoothed spectral envelope ?  Wha - wh i i uh , how is that , uh ?  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  So you you end up with a vector that 's the same length as the FFT vector ?  And then you just , uh , compute differences  and ,  uh , sum the differences ?  Oh ! OK .

He has a trick for doing that involving viewing the DFT as a matrix .  Um ,  but , uh , um , I decided not to do that after all  because I I realized to use it I 'd need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow  and right now I think our feature computation is set to up to , um , take , um , audio as input , in general .  So I decided that I I 'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows  and then just re - synthesize audio  and then send that .

Bro015.A,"OK  So they would just provide that as part of the data .  How about the um the thing that you guys were working on before  the uh Uh voiced - unvoiced  uh  Ah . You stopped working on it  I see  No . I didn't .  Um , are you talking about  Uh , no .  This week I haven't .  I 've been my whole time 's been taken up with uh Meeting Recorder stuff .  Uh , disk crash and uh covering things .  Oh . You know , there is one other thing .  Um Stephane showed me a paper yesterday um where th uh for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um the number of iterations , that I talked about last week ?  And , um , so , there was a whole series of those that they had done .  They didn't , I don't think , reported timing for those ,  but um it turns out that the one that they 're actually using was not the best , uh in in their series of experiments , which I uh Maybe it 's because they uh wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages and this was only done on Italian or something .  Uh , I don't know who did it  do you know , Stephane ?  Who did that ?  So um you know there wasn't a huge difference in terms of the performance across all the different experiments that they did .  Um . But it varied a little bit .  And uh So I guess the main thing that I take out of that is that I think that for our purposes here we could definitely you know decrease the number of iterations that we do  and um ,  at least while we 're , you know , working on uh all different of kinds of variations , and that would let us , you know , pump through a lot more experiments .  So um I still have to to send everybody a pointer about uh how to run the um HTK system on the Linux boxes and about changing these number of iterations so that so that you can do that .  Um . So the the other thing that that I was thinking about maybe trying out next is  um  Oh !  The other th the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state .  And so .  OK .  I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder what they did about  Oh , OK .  I was thinking it was Gaussians but it 's states .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So . The thing I was thinking about was uh , you know , the number of insertions really goes up when you start adding all the noise in ,  and maybe the thing to do next would be to try to um uh make the silence model more powerful ,  you know , increasing the number of Gaussians to the number of states , different different things like that ,  so . That 's probably the next little thing I 'll play with when I get a chance  ",,
Bro015.B,"Well um . One thing in in the paper Avendano and his collaborators wrote is that is that um they tried doing channel normalization on the reverberant in speech by um subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude over a two second window .  But they didn't do anything with the phase , and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way .  So I 'm I 'm going to start thinking about um ways that the ph that the phase could be used .  Um .  Si - if if the um channel and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the phases should be additive .  So um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would would help .  Um but I don't know I th I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful .

Bro015.C,"Alright .  It will be some sometime in summer .  July or August , or .  Mm - hmm .  Oh yeah .  Well , the news more specifically t for Aurora  um  So I guess there was again a conference call but uh they are not decide on everything yet .  For the VAD they probably they will do something like having some kind of idealized VAD that they could run on the channel zero of the SpeechDat - Car  and then take the same um end points and apply them on channel one  so it 's  Uh g  Yeah , to the clean and take the end points for the noisy .

So it would be weighting of  um  It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of word error rates which would make the more clean parts of TI - digits more important than they are right now .

Bro016.E,"Let 's see .  Test ?  Test ?  Yeah .  OK .  I was saying Hynek 'll be here next week ,  uh , Wednesday through Friday  uh , through Saturday ,  and , um ,  I won't be here Thursday and Friday .  But my suggestion is that , uh , at least for this meeting , people should go ahead ,  uh , cuz Hynek will be here ,  and ,  you know , we don't have any Czech accent yet ,  uh , as far as I know ,  so  There we go .  Um .  So other than reading digits , what 's our agenda ?  OK .  Um .  Do you think that would be the case for next week also ?  Or is is , uh ?  What 's your projection on ?  Cuz the one thing the one thing that seems to me we really should try , if you hadn't tried it before , because it hadn't occurred to me  it was sort of an obvious thing  is , um , adjusting the , uh , sca the scaling and , uh , insertion penalty sorta stuff .

In other words , that even though it sounds pretty dumb , just applying the same number of states to everything , more or less , no matter what language , isn't so bad .  Right ?  And I guess you hadn't gotten to all the experiments you wanted to do with number of Gaussians ,  but , um ,  let 's just  If we had to if we had to draw a conclusion on the information we have so far , we 'd say something like that .  Right ?  Uh , so the next question to ask , which is I think the one that that that Andreas was dre addressing himself to in the lunch meeting , is , um , we 're not supposed to adjust the back - end ,  but anybody using the system would .  So ,  if you were just adjusting the back - end , how much better would you do , uh , in noise ?  Uh , because the language scaling and insertion penalties and so forth are probably set to be about right for mel cepstrum .  But , um , they 're probably not at all set right for these things ,  particularly these things that look over , uh , larger time windows , in one way or another with with LDA and KLT and neural nets and all these things .  In the fa past we 've always found that we had to increase the insertion penalty to to correspond to such things .  So ,  I think that 's , uh , @ @ that 's kind of a first - order thing that that we should try .  So by "" our front - end "" I mean take , you know , the Aurora - two s take some version that Stephane has that is , you know , our current best version of something .  Um .  I mean , y don't wanna do this over a hundred different things that they 've tried  but , you know , for some version that you say is a good one .  You know ?  Um .  How how much , uh , does it improve if you actually adjust that ?  But it is interesting .  You say you you have for the noisy  How about for the for the mismatched or or or or the or the medium mismatched conditions ?  Have you ?  When you adjusted those numbers for mel cepstrum , did it ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  OK .  So  Yeah .  And , um  Yeah .  Also , eh , eh , sometimes if you run behind on some of these things , maybe we can get someone else to do it  and you can supervise or something .  But  but I think it would be it 'd be good to know that .  OK .  Uh .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Cuz , I mean , the the other  That , in fact , might have been part of what , uh , the difference was  at least part of it that that we were seeing .  Remember we were seeing the SRI system was so much better than the tandem system .  Part of it might just be that the SRI system , they they they always adjust these things to be sort of optimized ,  and  Yes .  I think you can .  Well , um  uh ,  part of what 's going on , um , is the , uh , the range of values .  So , if you have something that has a much smaller range or a much larger range , and taking the appropriate root .  You know ?  If something is kind of like the equivalent of a bunch of probabilities multiplied together , you can take a root of some sort .  If it 's like seven probabilities together , you can take the seventh root of it or something ,  ","I was saying Hynek 'll be here next week ,  uh , Wednesday through Friday  uh , through Saturday ,  I won't be here Thursday and Friday .

Bro016.E,"or if it 's in the log domain , divide it by seven .  But  but ,  um ,  that has a similar effect  because it changes the scale of the numbers of the differences between different candidates from the acoustic model  as opposed to what 's coming from the language model .  Yeah .  I mean , it 's more directly like the the language scaling or the , uh the model scaling or acoustic scaling ,  but you know that those things have kind of a similar effect to the insertion penalty  anyway . They 're a slightly different way of of handling it .  So , um  I think so .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So that 's why I think  that 's another reason other than curiosity as to why i it would in fact be kinda neat to find out if we 're way off .  I mean , the other thing is , are aren't we seeing ? Y y  I 'm sure you 've already looked at this  bu in these noisy cases , are ? We are seeing lots of insertions .  Right ?  The insertion number is quite high ?  I know the VAD takes pre care of part of that ,  but  Yeah .  Wha - what 's a typical number ?  Do we ?  Oh , you oh , you don't know .  OK .  I 'm sure it 's more balanced ,  but it it it wouldn't surprise me if there 's still  I mean , in in the the the old systems we used to do , I I uh , I remember numbers kind of like insertions being half the number of deletions , as being and both numbers being tend to be on the small side comparing to to , uh , substitutions .  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  And it may be less of a critical thing .  I mean , the fact that some get by may be less of a critical thing if you , uh , get things in the right range .  So , I mean , the insertions is is a symptom .  It 's a symptom that there 's something , uh , wrong with the range .  But there 's uh , your your your substitutions tend to go up as well .  So , uh , I I I think that ,  uh , the most obvious thing is just the insertions , @ @ .  But  Uh  um .  If you 're operating in the wrong range I mean , that 's why just in general , if you change what these these penalties and scaling factors are , you reach some point that 's a that 's a minimum .  So .  Um .  Um .  We do have to do well over a range of different conditions ,  some of which are noisier than others .  Um .  But , um , I think we may get a better handle on that if we if we see  Um , I mean we ca  it 's if we actually could pick a a a more stable value for the range of these features , it , um , uh , could  Uh  Even though it 's it 's it 's true that in a real situation you can in fact adjust the these these scaling factors in the back - end , and it 's ar artificial here that we 're not adjusting those , you certainly don't wanna be adjusting those all the time .  And if you have a nice front - end that 's in roughly the right range  I remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built , that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level ,  and we would rarely adjust them again ,  even though you could get a  for an evaluation you can get an extra point or something if you tweaked it a little bit .  But ,  once we knew what rou roughly the right operating range was , it was pretty stable ,  and Uh , we might just not even be in the right operating range .  No . You don't wanna change it for different conditions .  No .  No .  I I I What what I 'm saying  Yeah .  Well . It depends how much we wanna do gamesmanship and how much we wanna do  I mean , i if he  it to me , actually , even if you wanna be play on the gamesmanship side , it can be kinda tricky .  So , I mean , what you would do is set the set the scaling factors , uh , so that you got the best number for this point four five times the you know , and so on .  But they might change that  those weightings .  Um .  So  Uh  I just sorta think we need to explore the space .  Just take a look at it a little bit .  And we we we may just find that that we 're way off .  Maybe we 're not .  You know ?  As for these other things , it may turn out that , uh , it 's kind of reasonable .

Bro016.E,"that 's a topic you should discuss with Hynek  to , you know , double check it 's OK .  Social security number  What kind of information do you mean ?  Hmm .  Uh .  Right .  I mean , again , i if you had the whole system you were optimizing , that would be easy to see .  But if you 're supposedly just using a fixed back - end and you 're just coming up with a feature vector , w w I 'm not sure  I mean , having the two nets Suppose you detected that it was male , it was female you come up with different  Maybe .  Hmm .  Yeah , it 's an interesting thought .  Maybe having something along the  I mean , you can't really do vocal tract normalization .  But something that had some of that effect  being applied to the data in some way .  Um .  Yeah . But just listen to yourself .  I mean , that uh really doesn't sound like a real - time thing with less than two hundred milliseconds , uh , latency that and where you 're not adjusting the statistical engine at all .  You know , that just  I mean  Yeah .  No .  Well not just expensive .  I I I don't see how you could possibly do it .  You can't look at the whole utterance and do anything . You know , you can only  Right ?  Each frame comes in and it 's gotta go out the other end .  So , uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean , you can do ,  um  Fairly quickly you can do male female f male female stuff .  But as far as ,  I mean Like I thought BBN did a thing with , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization a ways back .  Maybe other people did too .  With with , uh , uh , l trying to identify third formant average third formant using that as an indicator of  So .  You know , third formant  I if you imagine that to first order what happens with , uh , changing vocal tract is that , uh , the formants get moved out by some proportion  So , if you had a first formant that was one hundred hertz before , if the fifty if the vocal tract is fifty percent shorter , then it would be out at seven fifty hertz ,  and so on .  So , that 's a move of two hundred fifty hertz .  Whereas the third formant which might have started off at twenty - five hundred hertz , you know , might be out to thirty - seven fifty ,  you know so it 's at  So ,  although , you frequently get less distinct higher formants , it 's still third formant 's kind of a reasonable compromise ,  and  So , I think , eh , if I recall correctly , they did something like that .  And and  But Um , that doesn't work for just having one frame or something .  You know ? That 's more like looking at third formant over over a turn or something like that ,  and  Um .  So .  But on the other hand , male female is a is a is a much simpler categorization than figuring out a a factor to , uh , squish or expand the the spectrum .  So , um .  Y you could imagine that  I mean , just like we 're saying voiced - unvoiced is good to know  uh , male female is good to know also .  Um .  But , you 'd have to figure out a way to to to , uh , incorporate it on the fly .  Uh , I mean , I guess , as you say , one thing you could do is simply , uh , have the the male and female output vectors you know , tr nets trained only on males and n trained only on females  or  or , uh ,  you know .  But  Um .  I don't know if that would really help ,  because you already have males and females  and it 's mm - hmm putting into one net .  So  is it ?  Do you know ?  Hmm .  OK .  Y you 're you were saying before ?  Shouldn't be .  They should be less so .  R right ?  Wh - ?  But let me ask you this .  What what 's the , um ?  Do you kno recall if the insertions were were higher with MSG ?  Yeah . But you should always look at insertions , deletions , and substitutions .  So  so , uh  MSG is very , very dif  Eh , PLP is very much like mel cepstrum .  MSG is very different from both of them .  So , if it 's very different , then this is the sort of thing  I mean I 'm really glad Andreas brought this point up .  I sort of had forgotten to discuss it .  Um .  You always have to look at how this uh , these adjustments , uh , affect things .  And even though we 're not allowed to do that , again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features .  So if it if in fact , uh  The problem might be that the range of the MSG features is quite different than the range of the PLP or mel cepstrum .  And you might wanna change that .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That means they 're between zero and one .  But i it it it it doesn't necessarily  You know , they could be ,  um  Do - doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is .  Right ?

So they 're kinda like log probabilities is what I was saying .  Uh , almost .  But then you actually do a KLT on them .  Um .  They aren't normalized after that ,  are they ?  No .  OK .  So , um .

And if the if  the , uh  i if there 's a fairly large effect of the difference , say , uh , uh , the r ratio between insertions and deletions for the two cases then that would be , uh , an indicator that it might might be in that direction .

Well , we 're all gathered here together .  I thought we 'd , you know  Whose paper is it ?  Yeah .  Huh .  From , uh , University of Hamburg and Bielefeld .  OK .  So , stuff that 's not based on data .  Yeah .  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  OK .  I mean , when we did the SPAM work I mean , there we had we had this notion of an , uh , auditory @ @ auditory event .  And , uh ,  um ,  called them "" avents "" ,  uh , uh , uh , with an A at the front .  Uh .  And the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere .  So .  Um . A sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this .  I mean , there 's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gonna fire because something novel has happened .  That was that was the main thing that we were focusing on there .  But there 's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that aren't just sort of rapid changes ,  but  Yeah .  ","Well , this 'll be , I think , something for discussion with Hynek next week .  How are , uh , uh how are things going with what you 're doing ?  do you wanna say something about your stuff here ?

Bro016.F,"OK .  I don't really have , uh , anything new .  Been working on Meeting Recorder stuff .  So .  Um .  I did play with that , actually , a little bit .  Um . What happens is , uh , when you get to the noisy stuff , you start getting lots of insertions .  And , um ,  so I 've tried playing around a little bit with , um , the insertion penalties and things like that .  Um .  I mean , it it didn't make a whole lot of difference .

OK .  Uh , I I don't remember off the top of my head .  Um .  Yeah . I didn't even write them down .  I I I don't remember .  I would need to  Well , I did write down ,  um  So , when I was doing I just wrote down some numbers for the well - matched case .  Um .

I I would  Yeah .  I would need to do that .  I can do that for next week .  OK .  I just need to get , um , front - end , uh , stuff from you  or you point me to some files that you 've already calculated .  I probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence model .  So maybe I can have that for next week when Hynek 's here .  Hmm .  Is there ?  I wonder if there 's anything that we could do to the front - end that would affect the insertion  What could you do ?  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Oh ,  right .  So that w  Right .  So , in effect , that 's changing the value of your insertion penalty .  That 's interesting .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  So if we know what the insertion penalty is , then we can get an idea about what range our number should be in ,  so that they match with that .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I 've seen that with the mel cepstrum .  I don't I don't know about the Aurora front - end ,  but  Well , this  the whole problem with insertions was what I think , um , we talked about when the guy from OGI came down that one time  and  and that was when people were saying , well we should have a , uh , uh , voice activity detector  that , because all that stuff that we 're getting thr the silence that 's getting through is causing insertions .  So .  I 'll bet you there 's still a lot of insertions .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So , would the ?  Uh , would a good idea be to try to map it into the same range that you get in the well - matched case ?  So , if we computed what the range was in well - matched , and then when we get our noisy conditions out we try to make it have the same range as ?  Oh , I wasn't suggesting change it for different conditions .  I was just saying that when we pick a range , we we wanna pick a range that we map our numbers into  we should probably pick it based on the range that we get in the well - matched case .

So I guess that what may be a reasonable is if I uh first make a report on what 's happening in Aurora in general , at least what from my perspective .

Bro017.B,"And uh and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed .  And so last time uh during the meeting , I just uh brought up the issue ,  I said "" well you know uh quite frankly I 'm surprised how lightly you are making these decisions  because this is a major decision .  For two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement  and suddenly you are saying "" oh no we we will do something less "" ,  but maybe we should discuss that .  And everybody said "" oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there ""  and I said "" well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing c things .

So eh they agreed , and so they said "" OK , we will discuss that . ""  Immediately Nokia uh raised the question  and they said "" oh yeah we agree this is not good to to uh dissolve the uh uh the uh the criterion . ""  So now officially , Nokia is uh uh complaining and said they they are looking for support ,  uh I think QualComm is uh saying , too "" we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet .  We should at least try once again , one more round . ""  So this is where we are .  I hope that I hope that this is going to be a adopted .  Next Wednesday we are going to have uh another uh teleconferencing call , so we 'll see what uh where it goes .  Yeah ,  that 's what that 's a g very good uh point ,  because David says "" well you know we ca we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways . ""  So while you are right but uh you know but  Uh yeah ,  if of course if you put a zero uh weight zero on a mismatched condition , or highly mismatched then then you are done .  But weights were also deter already decided uh half a year ago .  So  Well , of course people will not like it .  Now What is happening now is that I th I think that people try to match the criterion to solution .  They have solution .  Now they want to make sure their criterion is  And I think that this is not the right way .  Uh it may be that that  Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen .  But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could .  And I don't think we did .  Basically , I think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data  and uh essentially there were these arbitrary decisions made , and and everything .  So , so so this is so this is where it is .  So what we are doing at OGI now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected ,  like noise separation .  Uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically ,  which would be a l uh , f more robust to noise ,  and so far not much uh success .  We tried uh things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested ,  instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model .  Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise .  And I thought "" well , that makes sense , "" but so far we can't get much much out of it .  uh we may try some standard techniques like spectral subtraction and  not not not much .  Or even I was thinking about uh looking back into these totally ad - hoc techniques  like for instance uh Dennis Klatt was suggesting uh the one way to uh deal with noisy speech is to add noise to everything .  So . I mean , uh uh add moderate amount of noise to all data .  So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a effective ,  right ?  Because you already uh had the noise uh in a  And it was working at the time .  It was kind of like one of these things , you know , but  if you think about it , it 's actually pretty ingenious .  So well , you know , just take a take a spectrum and and and add of the constant , C , to every every value .  Exactly .  And if if then if this data becomes noisy , it b it becomes eff effectively becomes less noisy basically .  But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down ,  but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much ,  it 's a very simple technique .  Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique ,  you just take your spectrum and and use whatever is coming from FFT , add constant ,  you know ?  on onto power spectrum .  That that  Or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum , what you can s start doing , you can leave start leaving out the p the parts which are uh uh low in energy  and then perhaps uh one could try to find a a all - pole model to such a spectrum .

I have a visitor from Brno .  He 's a kind of like young faculty .  pretty hard - working so he so he 's so he 's looking into that .  And then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this e e TRAP recognition .  This uh this is this recognition from temporal patterns .  Ah , you don't know about TRAPS !  Yeah  I mean tha  This is familiar like sort of because we gave you the name ,  but , what it is , is that normally what you do is that you recognize uh speech based on a shortened spectrum .  Essentially L P - LPC , mel cepstrum , uh , everything starts with a spectral slice .  Uh so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding sliding the spectrogram along the uh f frequency axis  and you keep shifting this thing , and you have a spectrogram .  So you can say "" well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency "" ,  and what you get is then , that you get a p vector .  And this vector can be a a s assigned to s some phoneme .  Namely you can say i it I will I will say that this vector will eh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector .  And you can try to classify based on that .  And you so you classi  so it 's a very different vector , very different properties ,  we don't know much about it ,  but the truth is  Well , so you get many decisions .  And then you can start dec thinking about how to combine these decisions .  Exactly , that 's what yeah , that 's what it is .  Because if you run this uh recognition , you get you still get about twenty percent error  uh twenty percent correct .  You know ,  on on like for the frame by frame basis ,  so uh uh so it 's much better than chance .  That 's another thing .  Well c currently we start I mean we start always with critical band spectrum .  For various reasons .  But uh the latest uh observation uh is that you you you are you can get quite a big advantage of using two critical bands at the same time .  Adjacent , adjacent .  And the reasons there are some reasons for that .  Because there are some reasons I can I could talk about , will have to tell you about things like masking experiments which uh uh uh uh yield critical bands ,  and also experiments with release of masking , which actually tell you that something is happening across critical bands , across bands .  And  It 's uh uh uh I mean time T - zero is one number , time t  It 's a spectral energy , logarithmic spectral energy ,  yeah .  Yes , yes .  Yes , yes .  And that 's what that 's what I 'm saying then ,  so this is a this is a starting vector .  It 's just like shortened f spectrum , or something .  But now we are trying to understand what this vector actually represents ,  for instance a question is like "" how correlated are the elements of this vector ? ""  Turns out they are quite correlated , because I mean , especially the neighboring ones ,  right ?  They they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract .  So there 's a very high correlation .  So the classifiers which use the diagonal covariance matrix don't like it .  So we 're thinking about de - correlating them .  Then the question is uh "" can you describe elements of this vector by Gaussian distributions "" , or to what extent ?  Because uh  And and and so on and so on .  So we are learning quite a lot about that .  And then another issue is how many vectors we should be using ,  I mean the so the minimum is one .  But I mean is the is the critical band the right uh uh dimension ?  So we somehow made arbitrary decision , "" yes "" .  Then but then now we are thinking a lot how to uh how to use at least the neighboring band because that seems to be happening  This I somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition .  Cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands ,  but then oh uh uh  so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal in uh uh independently in individual critical bands .  That 's what masking experiments tell you .  But at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands  when you are making any decisions , you compare what 's happening in in this band to what 's happening to the band to to to the to the neighboring bands .  And that 's how you make uh decisions .  That 's why the articulatory events , which uh F F Fletcher talks about , they are about two critical bands .  You need at least two , basically .  You need some relative , relative relation .  Absolute number doesn't tell you the right thing .  You need to you need to compare it to something else , what 's happening  but it 's what 's happening in the in the close neighborhood .  ","And then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this e e TRAP recognition .  This uh this is this recognition from temporal patterns .  but , what it is , is that normally what you do is that you recognize uh speech based on a shortened spectrum .

Uh so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding sliding the spectrogram along the uh f frequency axis  and you keep shifting this thing , and you have a spectrogram .

Namely you can say i it I will I will say that this vector will eh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector .  so it 's a very different vector , very different properties ,  ",He also brought the ICSI members up to date with his group's latest work. 
Bro017.B,"So if you are making decision what 's happening at one kilohertz , you want to know what 's happening at nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred hertz ,  but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz .  To some extent , it that is also true .  Yeah .  But it 's but for but for instance , th uh uh what what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if th if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands , recognition can discard it .  Is what 's happening  Hey !  OK , we need us another another voice here .  Yeah ,  I think so .  Yeah ?  And so so so for instance if you d if you a if you add the noise that normally masks masks the uh the the signal  right ?  and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band .  Unless this noise is modulated .  If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less .  The moment you moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands .  So the s m masking curve , normally it looks like sort of  I start from from here ,  so you you have uh no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing .  And when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same .  So that 's the famous experiment of Fletcher , a long time ago .  Like that 's where people started thinking "" wow this is interesting ! ""  So .  But , if you if you if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band , the masking goes down .  So essentially essentially that 's a very clear indication that that that cognition can take uh uh into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands .  But if you go too far in a in a if you if the noise is very broad , you are not increasing much more ,  so so if you if you are far away from the signal uh from the signal f uh the frequency at which the signal is , then the m even the when the noise is co - modulated it it 's not helping you much .  So .  So things like this we are kind of playing with with with the hope that perhaps we could eventually u use this in a in a real recognizer .  Like uh partially of course we promised to do this under the the the Aurora uh program .  Probably not .  Well , maybe , most likely we will not have anything which c would comply with the rules .  like because uh uh  latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency amount of processing ,  because uh we don't know any better , yet , than to use the neural net classifiers , uh and uh and uh TRAPS .  Though the the work which uh everybody is looking at now aims at s trying to find out what to do with these vectors , so that a g simple Gaussian classifier would be happier with it .  or to what extent a Gaussian classifier should be unhappy uh  that , and how to Gaussian - ize the vectors ,  and  So this is uh what 's happening .  Then Sunil is uh uh uh asked me f for one month 's vacation  and since he did not take any vacation for two years , I had no I didn't have heart to tell him no .  So he 's in India .  And uh  Uh well , he may be looking for a girl , for for I don't I don't I don't ask .  I know that Naran - when last time Narayanan did that he came back engaged .  Yeah .  I know .  I know , I know ,  and then of course then what happened with Narayanan was that he start pushing me that he needs to get a PHD because they wouldn't give him his wife .  And she 's very pretty and he loves her  and so so we had to really  Oh yeah .  We had well I had a incentive because he he always had this plan except he never told me .  Sort of figured that That was a uh that he uh he told me the day when we did very well at our NIST evaluations of speaker recognition , the technology , and he was involved there .  We were after presentation we were driving home and he told me .  Yeah .  So I I said "" well , yeah , OK "" so he took another another three quarter of the year but uh he was out .  So I wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that , though though uh Pratibha still needs to get out first .  Cuz Pratibha is there a a year earlier .  And S and Satya needs to get out very first because he 's he already has uh four years served ,  though one year he was getting masters .  So .  So .  Which ?  Speaker recognition ?  Uh there , we don't know about evaluation ,  next meeting is in June .  And uh uh but like getting get together .  Nobody said that yet .  I assume so .  Uh yes , uh , but nobody even set up yet the date for uh delivering uh endpointed data .  And this uh that that sort of stuff .  ",,
Bro017.B,"But I uh ,  yeah ,  what I think would be of course extremely useful , if we can come to our next meeting and say "" well you know we did get fifty percent improvement .  If if you are interested we eventually can tell you how "" , but uh we can get fifty percent improvement .  Because people will s will be saying it 's impossible .  Twenty - two t twenty twenty - two percent better than the old baseline .  u Yes .  Yes .  But I assume that it will be similar , I don't I I don't see the reason why it shouldn't be .  I d I don't see reason why it should be worse .  Cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection ,  we say "" well you know how come ? ""  Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them .  We get this sort of improvement ,  how come that we don't see it on on on on your endpointed data ?  I think so .  Yeah .  C yeah uh  and on clean speech data .  Yeah .  Well David told me  David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm  and Harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent  he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent uh comparing to to endpointed baselines ?  So they must have run already something .  So .  And Harry said "" Yeah .  But I mean we think that we we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . ""  So . So there 's a lot of discussion now about this uh new criterion .  Because Nokia was objecting , with uh QualComm 's we basically supported that , we said "" yes "" .  Now everybody else is saying "" well you guys might must be out of your mind . ""  uh The Guenter Hirsch who d doesn't speak for Ericsson anymore because he is not with Ericsson  and Ericsson may not may withdraw from the whole Aurora activity because they have so many troubles now .  Ericsson 's laying off twenty percent of people .  Well Guenter is already he got the job uh already was working on it for past two years or three years  he got a job uh at some some Fachschule , the technical college not too far from Aachen .  So it 's like professor u university professor  you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of it 's not Aachen University , but it 's a good school and he he 's happy .  And he well , he was hoping to work uh with Ericsson like on t uh like consulting basis ,  but right now he says says it doesn't look like that anybody is even thinking about speech recognition .  They think about survival .  Yeah .  So .  So . But this is being now discussed right now ,  and it 's possible that uh that that it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent .  But that means that nobody will probably get this im this improvement .  yet , wi with the current system .  Which event es essentially I think that we should be happy with  because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions  and  Uh , but not  Yeah .  Yes . Yes .  We we getting we getting there , right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Is it like sort of is  How did you come up with this number ?  If you improve twenty by twenty percent the c the f the all baselines , it 's just a quick c comp co computation ?  Uh - huh .  I think it 's about right .  Yeah , yeah .  So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in it w  driving in the car with Morgan this morning , we were discussing a good experiment for b for beginning graduate student who wants to run a lot of who wants to get a lot of numbers on something  which is , like , "" imagine that you will you will start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power .

Morgan was @ @ and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor ,  you know ,  uh in the  you know , just compress the whole vector .

Bro017.B,"and it 's highly affected by uh frequency response of the of the recording equipment and that sort of thing ,  so  so we were coming with all these f various lifters .  uh Bell Labs had he this uh uh r raised cosine lifter which still I think is built into H HTK for reasons n unknown to anybody ,  but but uh we had exponential lifter , or triangle lifter , basic number of lifters .  And . But so they may be a way to to fiddle with the f with the f  Insertions , deletions , or the the giving a relative uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters .

Oh , I mean , I mean the places which have a lot of computing power ,  so because it is really it 's a p it 's a it 's it will be reasonable search  uh  but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants .

Because essentially you are saying "" uh this feature is not important "" .  Or less important ,  so that 's th that 's a that 's a painful one ,  yeah .  Yeah .  But but wait a minute .  You may not need to re uh uh retrain the m model .  You just may n may need to c uh give uh less weight to to uh a mod uh a component of the model which represents this particular feature .  You don't have to retrain it .  You just multiply .  Yeah .  Yep .  You modify the Gaussian in the model ,  but in the in the test data you would have to put it in the power ,  but in a training what you c in a training uh in trained model , all you would have to do is to multiply a model by appropriate constant .  Because in uh test in uh test data you ca don't have a model .  You have uh only data .  But in a in a tr  That is true ,  but w I mean , so what you want to do You want to say if uh obs you if you observe something like Stephane observes , that C - one is not important , you can do two things .  If you have a trained trained recognizer , in the model , you know the the the the component which I I mean di dimension wh  To the s you you know it .  But what I 'm proposing now , if it is important but not as important , you multiply it by point one in a model .  But but but  I think that you multiply the  I would I would have to look in the in the math ,  I mean how how does the model uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  Effectively , that 's that that 's I  Exactly .  That 's what you do .  That 's what you do , you you you modify the standard deviation as it was trained .  Effectively you , you know y in f in front of the of the model , you put a constant .  S yeah effectively what you 're doing is you is you are modifying the the the deviation .  Right ?  Yeah ,  the spread .  And and and  Yeah .  Your als  No .  By making it narrower ,  uh y your  Yes ,  so you making this particular dimension less important .  Because see what you are fitting is the multidimensional Gaussian ,  right ?  It 's a it has it has uh thirty - nine dimensions , or thirteen dimensions if you g ignore deltas and double - deltas .  So in order if you in order to make dimension which which Stephane sees uh less important , uh uh I mean not not useful , less important , what you do is that this particular component in the model you can multiply by w you can you can basically de - weight it in the model .  But you can't do it in a in a test data  because you don't have a model for th I mean uh when the test comes ,  but what you can do is that you put this particular component in and and you compress it .  That becomes uh th gets less variance , subsequently becomes less important .  That would be very bad ,  because uh your t your model was trained uh expecting uh ,  that wouldn't work .  Because your model was trained expecting a certain var variance on C - one .  And because the model thinks C - one is important .  After you train the model , you sort of y you could do you could do still what I was proposing initially ,  that during the training you you compress C - one that becomes then it becomes less important in a training .  But if you have if you want to run e ex extensive experiment without retraining the model , you don't have to retrain the model .  You train it on the original vector .  ",,
Bro017.B,"But after , you wh when you are doing this parametric study of importance of C - one you will de - weight the C - one component in the model ,  and you will put in the you will compress the this component in a in the test data . s by the same amount .  No ,  that would be a severe mismatch ,  right ?  what you are proposing ?  N no you don't want that .  Because that would then your model would be unlikely .  Your likelihood would be low ,  right ?  Because you would be providing severe mismatch .  No that would be very good match ,  right ?  That you would  I see what you are sa saying ,  but  uh , no , no I don't think that it would be the same .  I mean , no , the If you set it to a mean , that would  No , you can't do that .  Y you ca you ca Ch - Chuck , you can't do that .  Because that would be a really f fiddling with the data ,  you can't do that .  But what you can do , I 'm confident you ca  well , I 'm reasonably confident and I putting it on the record ,  right ?  I mean y people will listen to it for for centuries now ,  is what you can do , is you train the model uh with the with the original data .  Then you decide that you want to see how important C C - one is .  So what you will do is that a component in the model for C - one , you will divide it by by two .  And you will compress your test data by square root .  Then you will still have a perfect m match .  Except that this component of C - one will be half as important in a in a overall score .  Then you divide it by four and you take a square , f fourth root .  Then if you think that some component is more is more important then th th th it then then uh uh i it is , based on training , then you uh multiply this particular component in the model by by by  yeah .

Uh , since it is on the record , I can't say uh which company it was ,  but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company  and during a d during a discussion , there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns uh on a computer .  So after two hours uh the visitor said "" wh why are you hitting this carriage return ? ""  And he said "" well you know , we are being paid by a computer ty I mean we are we have a government contract .  And they pay us by by amount of computer time we use .

Nobody was looking even at what was coming out .  Yeah , I know ,  right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It would be similar similar to  I knew some people who were uh that was in old Communist uh Czechoslovakia ,  right ?  so we were watching for American airplanes , coming to spy on on uh on us at the time ,  so there were three guys uh uh stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely uh watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service  right ?  And so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village  and  and so but they there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above ,  and so that was the only work which they had .  ",,
Bro017.B,"They like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from Prague to Brno Basically f flying there ,  so they f very q f first thing was that they would always run back and and at four o ' clock and and quickly make a call , "" this plane is uh uh passing ""  then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub .  And they were calling from the pub .  And they but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they finally they had to p the the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore .  And one day there was there was no plane .  At least they were sort of smart enough that they looked if the plane is flying there ,  right ?  And the pub owner says "" oh my four o ' clock , OK , quickly p pick up the phone , call that there 's a plane flying .

Well , at least go test the s test the uh assumption about C - C - one I mean to begin with .  But then of course one can then think about some predictable result to change all of them .  It 's just like we used to do these uh these uh um the the uh distance measures .  It might be that uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Because you see , I mean , what is happening here in a in a in a in such a model is that it 's tells you yeah what has a low variance uh is uh is uh is more reliable ,  right ?  How do we  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  How do we know , especially when it comes to noise ?  Yeah ?  Yeah , th that 's  Yeah that 's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh Euclidean distance more like uh Mahalanobis distance with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data .  What they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance .  Turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast , I believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients .  I think you can show that uh uh analytically .  So typically what happens is that you you need to weight the uh weight the higher coefficients more than uh the lower coefficients .  So .  When Yeah .  When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea uh encourage for uh more communication between between uh uh different uh parts of the distributed uh uh center .

I don't think so .  No .  So we should do that .  We should definitely set up  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , that would make it easier .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And then we also can send the the dis to the same address  right ,  and it goes to everybody  Because what 's happening naturally in research , I know , is that people essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered ,  right ?  but what the the then the danger is in a group like this , is that two people are working on the same thing and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something .  Oh , there 's another thing which I wanted to uh uh report .  Lucash , I think , uh wrote the software for this Aurora - two system .  reasonably uh good one , because he 's doing it for Intel ,  but I trust that we have uh rights to uh use it uh or distribute it and everything .  Cuz Intel 's intentions originally was to distribute it free of charge anyways .  u s And so so uh we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use .  Just uh  It might be a reasonable point for p perhaps uh start converging .  Because Morgan 's point is that He is an experienced guy .  He says "" well you know it 's very difficult to collaborate if you are working with supposedly the same thing , in quotes , except which is not s is not the same .  Which which uh uh one is using that set of hurdles , another one set is using another set of hurdles .  So . And And then it 's difficult to c compare .  He got the he got the software .  Yeah . They sent the release .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah because Intel paid us uh  should I say on a microphone ?  uh some amount of money , not much .  Not much I can say on a microphone .  Much less then we should have gotten for this amount of work .

Bro017.B,"And they wanted uh to to have software so that they can also play with it , which means that it has to be in a certain environment  they use actu actually some Intel libraries , but in the process , Lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to f make sense uh of uh including ICSI software uh not for training on the nets  but I think he rewrote the the the or so maybe somehow reused over the parts of the thing so that so that the whole thing , including MLP , trained MLP is one piece of uh software .  Is it useful ?  Yeah ?  Or  That 's what he was saying ,  right .  He said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when ,  and and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up ,  and so I think it this is available .  So  uh e ev  n not maybe Maybe not in a first maybe not in a first ap approximation  because I think he started first just with a plain C C or C - plus - plus or something before  I I can check on that .  Yeah .  And uh in otherwise the Intel libraries , I think they are available free of f freely .  But they may be running only on on uh on uh Windows .  Or on on the  Yeah , on Intel architecture , may not run in SUN .  Yeah .  That is p that is that is possible .  That 's why Intel of course is distributing it ,  right ?  Or That 's  Yeah .  I know there was some issues that initially of course we d do all the development on Linux  but we use we don't have we have only three uh uh uh uh s SUNs  and we have them only because they have a SPERT board in .  Otherwise otherwise we t almost exclusively are working with uh PC 's now , with Intel .  In that way Intel succeeded with us , because they gave us too many good machines for very little money or nothing .  So . So . So we run everything on Intel .  And  Yes .

Bro017.C,"Hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I guess it could be even better ,  because the voice activity detector that I choosed is something that cheating , it 's using the alignment of the speech recognition system ,  and only the alignment on the clean channel , and then mapped this alignment to the noisy channel .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But maybe I I mean we are not too far from from fifty percent , from the new baseline .

But I think it 's uh the The variance is on on the denominator in the in the Gaussian equation .  So . I think it 's maybe it 's the contrary .  If you want to decrease the importance of a c parameter , you have to increase it 's variance .  Hmm .  That 's right .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I think What I see What could be done is you don't change your features , which are computed once for all ,  but you just tune the model .  So . You have your features .  You train your your model on these features .  And then if you want to decrease the importance of C - one you just take the variance of the C - one component in the in the model and increase it if you want to decrease the importance of C - one or decrease it  Well .  Mmm .  Just adjust the model ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  it becomes more flat  and  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  No ,  that 's right .

Bro017.E,"But why if you 're if you 're multi if you 're altering the model , why w in the test data , why would you have to muck with the uh cepstral coefficients ?  No . But you 're running your data through that same model .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  All of the all of the mean and variances that correspond to C - one , you put them to zero .  Yeah .  But what are you multiplying ?  Cuz those are means ,  right ?  I mean you 're  I think you  Yeah , I think you 'd have to modify the standard deviation or something , so that you make it wider or narrower .  Oop .  Sorry .  So .  So by making th the standard deviation narrower , uh your scores get worse for  unless it 's exactly right on the mean .  Right ?  I mean there 's you 're you 're allowing for less variance .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Couldn't you just do that to the test data and not do anything with your training data ?  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Could you also if you wanted to  if you wanted to try an experiment uh by leaving out say , C - one , couldn't you , in your test data , uh modify the all of the C - one values to be um way outside of the normal range of the Gaussian for C - one that was trained in the model ?  So that effectively , the C - one never really contributes to the score ?  Do you know what I 'm say  Yeah ,  someth  Mm - hmm .  But what if you set if to the mean of the model , then ?  And it was a cons you set all C - ones coming in through your test data , you you change whatever value that was there to the mean that your model had .  Yeah .

But don't you have to do something to the mean , also ?  But if your  If your um original data for C - one had a mean of two .  And now you 're you 're you 're changing that by squaring it .  Now your mean of your C - one original data has is four .  But your model still has a mean of two .  So even though you 've expended the range , your mean doesn't match anymore .  Do you see what I mean ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah , so y  It 's predictable , yeah .  Yeah .  But as a simple thing , you could just just muck with the variance .  to get uh this uh this the effect I think that you 're talking about ,  right ?  Could increase the variance to decrease the importance .  Yeah , because if you had a huge variance , you 're dividing by a large number , you get a very small contribution .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah , you know actually , this reminds me of something that happened uh when I was at BBN .  We were playing with putting um pitch into the Mandarin recognizer .  And this particular pitch algorithm um when it didn't think there was any voicing , was spitting out zeros .  So we were getting uh when we did clustering , we were getting groups uh of features  yeah , with with a mean of zero and basically zero variance .  So , when ener when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it , we got a great score .  I mean it was just , you know , incredibly high score , and so that was throwing everything off .  So if you have very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches .  So . So that 's a way , yeah , yeah  That 's a way to increase the yeah , n  That 's interesting .  So in fact , that would be  That doesn't require any retraining .  So that means it 's just  recognitions .  Yeah .  You you have a step where you you modify the models , make a d copy of your models with whatever variance modifications you make , and rerun recognition .  And then do a whole bunch of those .  That could be set up fairly easily I think ,  and you have a whole bunch of  you know  That 's an interesting idea , actually .  For testing the  Yeah .  Huh !  That 's right .

Uh , yeah ,  after the submission the what I 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions  and then  over their system , what they submitted ,  because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in in ours .  So  So I tried  uh ,  And u First I tried just LDA .  And then I found that  uh ,  I mean , if if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs .  Uh  Yeah .  Yeah .  So ,  just just the LDA filters .  I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that .  But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal .  What I did was I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech ,  uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement  so , instead of using this , uh , narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh , I got new filters .  So  that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system .  Slightly .  But , not very significantly .  And uh , that was  uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an LDA .  And uh ,  so then after after that I I added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that .  And that there there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used  because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant  and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one .  But um ,  I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot ,  I just t g  I just found that I have to reduce the value  I mean , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value .  That 's all I found  So I have to .  Uh ,  Yeah .  And uh ,  uh , the other other thing what I tried was , I just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information ,  just the Aurora baseline ,  to see that how much the baseline itself improves  by just supplying the information of the I mean the w speech and nonspeech .  And uh ,  I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh .  Yeah .  No .  No .  No , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used .  With the different time constant I found that  I mean , I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization ,  because I I found that I would have change the value of the update factor .  But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than .  So , it 's still not  I mean , the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement .  And uh ,  so ,  oh yeah  So I just stopped there with the uh , speech enhancement .  The the other thing what I tried was the adding the uh , endpoint information to the baseline  and that itself gives like twenty - two percent  because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech .  And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , uh , use  Yeah  that 's , that 's what the feeling is like .  They 're going to give the endpoint information .  Yeah .  So ,  Uh  No .  No .  That i I  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah ,  exactly .  I guess that is that is where the consensus is .  Like y you will you will You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech  but the whole speech is available to you .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So  So that that The baseline itself  I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent .  I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint .  w  I mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty .  So , uh ,  Yeah , by fifty percent .  Yeah ,  so  so that is when uh , the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched .

Bro019.A,"I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks .  Uh .  Ye  Yeah ,  and I I came back and I started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm .  I mean , so I from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . These are the main uh , approaches where people have tried ,  so just to just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I I 've been working on this uh , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement  where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace  and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace .  And  So , I 've been actually running some s  So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab .  I have to to to test whether it works first or not  and then I 'll p port it to C  and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result .  So , yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah .  Uh , no  there is a slight different .  Uh  I mean , which are extracted at the handset  because they had another back - end blind equalization  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .  The speech .  Yeah ,  the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way  because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech .  I mean , if we are using our own code for th I mean that that could be the only difference .  I mean , there is no other difference .  Yeah .  OK .  OK .  Uh - huh .  Only LDA .  Yeah .  Af - I after that I added on - line normalization ,  yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , I assume .  Yeah .  without any change .  OK .  with  Oh yeah ,  I mean the the new LDA filters .  I mean  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Because the your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet  so .  But the the well - matched may still  I mean the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information .  Yeah .  So the  the MM  MM and HM are going to be v hugely affected by it .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But they d the everything I mean is like ,  but there  that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on .  Uh , no ,  I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting .  Yeah .  So there 's nothing on  Yeah .  Usual .  Uh - huh .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Hmm .  Right .  Yeah , but actually the well well the well - matched  um ,  uh ,  I mean the the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits  where uh , you have all the training , uh , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also .  It 's like , this is not calibrated by SNR or something .  The well - matched has also some some mismatch in that which is other than the  has has also some slight mismatches ,  unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched  because it 's artificially added noise .  But this is natural recording .  The the well - matched is like  the the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing .  It 's it 's  OK ,  it 's  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah because the m the main major reason for the m  the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually .  No  yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins .  But for speech recognition , it may not .  I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT .  So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that .  Well  Yeah ?  So , it may not be really a big different .  It  I Uh - huh .  So  The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique ,  uh ,  is it like one stage speech enhancement ?  Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals ,  which is really giving them some improvement .  I mean they just do the same thing again once more .  And So , there 's something that is good about doing it  I mean , to cleaning it up once more .  Yeah ,  so we can  Yeah .  That 's what  That 's wh  Yeah .  So ,  Yeah .  So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace ,  I mean just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not .  The signal subspace ?  The  The signal subspace approach has actually an in - built Wiener filtering in it .  Yeah .  It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter .  ",,
Bro019.A,"Is the signal is is a signal substrate .  So , the the different  the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad .  It 's  it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions , and in colored noise .  Wiener filtering .  It 's a it 's a cascade of two s  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  So .  So that that 's one reason maybe we could combine  s some something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,  and then do a something in the second stage  which could take it further .  Oh , the colored noise  uh  the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean , it it actually depends on inverting the matrices .  So it it ac  the covariance matrix of the noise .  So if if it is not positive definite ,  I mean it has a it 's  It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite  ak  It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .  So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering ,  first of the colo colored noise  and then make the noise white ,  and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Huh ?  Uh - huh .  So .  This VTS has been proposed by CMU ?  Is it is it the CMU ?  Yeah , yeah , OK .  From C .  The other thing is to , uh Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks .  But we we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage ,  which is also going to be a noisy task  so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all .  So , there are some  I mean , I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks  and  spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks .  And it 's  Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere .  But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that .

Or anything .  Oh , OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , d  Yeah .  What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that .  That is just a binary feature  and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise  but not much on the TI - digits .  So , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping .  That 's it .  Yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum ,  just the baseline .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Well , in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything ,  because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech ,  and it was very short .  But Italian was like very it was a huge improvement on Italian .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Mmm .  There was a paper in ICASSP this ICASSP over the uh extracting some higher - order uh , information from the cepstral coefficients  and I forgot the name .  Some is some harmonics  I don't know ,  I can I can pull that paper out from ICASSP .  It  Huh ?  Uh , I don't know .  I don't remember .  It wa it was taking the , um  It was about finding the higher - order moments of  Yeah .  And I 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments , or  maybe higher - order cumulants  and  Yeah .  It was it was  Yeah .

Bro019.C,"So it 's g it 's gonna be harder to beat that actually .  But but  OK .  No , that 's that 's that 's a good good update .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  S  So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second .  So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here  and so we we 'll have a single place where the stuff is .  Cool .  Um ,  so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments .  Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week ,  I guess ?  Um , where you were also combining something  both of you I guess were both combining something from the uh , French Telecom system with the u uh  I I don't know whether it was system one or system two ,  or ?  OK .  So I let me let me just stop you there .  So then , one distinction is that uh , you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to  Yeah .  Yeah .  But that 's what I mean .  But u u  Sorry ,  yeah , I 'm not being I 'm not being clear .  What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ?  And so one difference is that , I guess you were taking spectra .  But you got some sort of different result .  So I 'm trying to understand it .  But uh ,  I th  So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something  and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  But are they changing the weighting ?  I don't understand that .  I guess I I haven't been part of the discussion ,  so , um ,  it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual ,  in this case .  Unusual .  Because , um , you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person 's car is like ,  or  uh ,  It seems like something like the middle one is is more natural .  So I don't know why the well - matched is  uh  The well wa matched has mismatch ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  So remind me of what well - matched meant ?  You 've told me many times .  Yeah .  Right .  So , I mean ,  yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched ,  it is pretty much  You know , so it 's so it 's sort of saying if you  Uh , it 's not guaranteed .  Right .  Right .  Again , if you have enough if you have enough  So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK ,  so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car ,  and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something ,  and then I don't think that 's very realistic ,  I mean I th  I I you know ,  so I  I I you know ,  I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars ,  and and you would have something that was roughly similar  and maybe that 's the argument ,  but I 'm not sure I buy it ,  so .  Uh ,  So  What else is going on ?  Hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing .  I mean maybe one or one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first .  Right ,  so he 's doing a signal subspace thing ,  maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction ,  or maybe vi maybe the other way around ,  you know ?  How is it  I I guess I 'm ignorant about this ,  how does  I mean , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals , how is how is that differ from signal subspace ?  Yeah .  Oh , OK .  Oh , oh , OK  so the difference is the KL .  I see .  So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a  Wiener filter .  Yeah , in general , you don't  that 's right  you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy .  Actually .  Um , that was something that uh , Herve and I were talking about with um , the multi - band stuff ,  that if you 're converting things to from uh , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy .  Uh ,  so .  Yeah .  So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I was only half kidding .  I mean if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid  and then you then then add a little bit l noise noise addition  I mean , that sort of what J JRASTA does , in a way .  If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise ,  ","so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments .

Oh yeah .  Well one of the seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari 's here ,  cuz Hari 'll have his own ideas too  or I guess not next week ,  week and a half ,  uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives ,  what we 've seen so far ,  and come up with some game plans .  Um .  You know .  So , I mean one way would  he Here are some alternate visions .  I mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly ,  you pick on something that looks like it 's promising  and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing .  Another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things ,  and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better ,  and then ,  you know ,  uh ,  but , w um ,  uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too .

OK .  And then they 're they 're uh , uh , generating HTK scripts to  Mis - Mississippi State maybe ,  yeah .  Yeah , so that 'll be a little little task in itself .  Um ,  well we 've  Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too .  But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News .  So we we did the Broadcast News evaluation  and some of the focus conditions were noisy  and and  But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction .  We were doing our funny stuff , right ?  We were doing multi multi uh , multi - stream and and so forth .  But it , you know , we di stuff we did helped .  I mean it , did something .  So .  Um ,  now we have this um , meeting data .  You know , like the stuff we 're recording right now ,  and  and uh ,  that we have uh , for the uh , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually .  It 's the far field mike .  And uh , we have uh , the digits that we do at the end of these things .  And that 's what most o  again , most of our work has been done with that ,  with with uh , connected digits .  Um ,  but uh , we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech ,  large vocabulary continuous speech , using Switchboard uh , Switchboard recognizer ,  uh ,  no training , from this ,  just just plain using the Switchboard .  That 's that 's what we 're doing ,  yeah .  Now there are some adaptation though ,  that that uh , Andreas has been playing with ,  but we 're hop  uh , actually uh , Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data .  Um ,  I mean , I guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh , the SRI recognizer  and , uh ,  Yeah ,  cuz everybody 's scared .  You 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the CPU or something trying to trying to do it ,  but  uh , yeah .  But , you 're right  that that that 's a real good point , that uh , we we don't know yeah , uh , I mean , what if any of these ta  I guess that 's why they 're pushing that in the uh in the evaluation .

I mean we 've had these discussions before ,  and and one of the things that struck me was that uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information .  And , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it ,  because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units .  Um ,  but , you 'll do throw something away .  And so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have .  And um .

Bro019.C,"when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking "" oh , OK ,  so they 're picking on something  they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice voiced property whatever . ""  So that that 's interesting .  Maybe that helps to drive the the thought process of coming up with the features .  But for me sort of the interesting thing was , "" well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? ""  So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network ,  and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or or whatever  Uh , no .  No  the just the same same way we 're using I mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank .  Exact way the same way we 're using the filter bank .  I mean , the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it 's good .  But it 's different .  And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing .  And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here .  Well , that 's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself ,  but it might help in combination .  But I I I have to tell you ,  I can't remember the conference ,  but , uh , I think it 's about ten years ago , I remember going to one of the speech conferences  and and uh ,  I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something ,  and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the FFT  and the FFT did slightly better .  So I mean the i i It 's true there 's lots of variability ,  but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a that variability , and you know , doing something reasonable with it .  So ,  um ,  uh ,  It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA ,  and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test ,  so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things ,  and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things .  So ,  part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not .  Uh , so anyway , it 's just a thought , that that if we if we had that maybe it 's just a baseline  uh , which would show us "" well , what are we really getting out of the filters "" ,  or maybe i i  probably not by itself ,  but in combination ,  uh ,  you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it ,  and let the  But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time ,  maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information .  But , maybe the neural net and the H M Ms could figure it out quicker than you .  So .  It 's just a thought .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  And it 's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints .  So .  Uh .  So .  Um .  Talking cumulants or something ?  Cumulants or something .  But No .  Yeah ,  cumulants ,  yeah .  Oh .  Or m e  Yeah .  Uh .  Yeah , but again You could argue that th that 's exactly what the neural network does .  So n neural network uh , is in some sense equivalent to computing , you know , higher - order moments of what you  yeah .  So .  I mean , it doesn't do it very specifically ,  and  pretty you know .  But .  Uh ,  anything on your end you want to talk about ?  Uh .  Yeah .  By by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at .  So ,  you know , um , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is ,  it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced ,  that one might be another thing .  Oh no .

Um ,  Do y wanna say anything about  You you actually been  Uh , last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre , you were you were mentioning .  Is that that something worth talking about ,  or ?  It 's a r root LPC , uh , of some sort .  Yeah .  No , no .  It 's it 's it 's taking the finding the roots of the LPC polynomial .  So it 's like line spectral pairs .  Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle ,  don't they ,  to sort of ?  But it  But uh , you know .  But what we 'd used to do w when I did synthesis at National Semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the LPC polynomial and and uh , finding the roots .  It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet ,  but it was just LPC ,  and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial ,  And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants ,  sometimes they 're not .  So it 's it 's it 's a little ,  uh Formant tracking with it can be a little tricky  cuz you get these funny values in in real speech ,  but .  Well you get these complex pairs .  And it depends on the order that you 're doing ,  but .  Yeah .  This is from synthetic speech ,  or ?  Yeah .  So if it 's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner .  I mean for real speech in real then what you end up having is , like I say , funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well .  But but mostly they are .  Mostly they do .  And and what I mean in in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was OK  because it was just a question of quantization .  Uh , we were just you know , storing  It was We were doing , uh , stored speech , uh , quantization .  But but uh , in your case  um , you know  I bet it it might have may have been  but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ?  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so the actual  So you 're not getting the actual formants per se .  You 're getting the Again , you 're getting sort of the ,  uh  You 're getting something that is is uh , af strongly affected by the PLP model .  And so it 's more psycho - acoustic .  So it 's a little It 's It 's It 's sort of sort of a different thing .  But Yeah .  i Ordinarily , in a formant synthesizer , the bandwidths as well as the ban uh , formant centers are  I mean , that 's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in ,  as as what you  But but yeah ,  you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section ,  which has , uh , band center and band width ,  and um ,  um  But .

Bro019.D,"R - nineteen ?  Hmm .  So it it 's it 's not systematically queued .  I mean all the jobs are running .  If you launch twenty jobs , they are all running .  Alright .  Uh - huh .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  It was system one .  So  we  The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom ,  which provide us some speech samples that are uh , with noise removed .  Yeah .  But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing  because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features ,  right ?  or ?  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , well I think we should uh , have a table with all the result  because I don't know I uh , I don't exactly know what are your results ?  But ,  Mmm .  Yeah , but so we did this ,  and another difference I guess is that we just applied uh , proposal - one system after this  without well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters ,  and  Well there are slight modifications ,  but it was the full proposal - one .  In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization ?  Mm - hmm .  So we just tried directly to to just , keep the system as it was  and ,  um ,  when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly .  Um ,  but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization .  Because if we keep the value that was submitted uh , it doesn't help at all .  You can remove on - line normalization , or put it , it doesn't change anything .  Uh , uh , as long as you have the spectral subtraction .  But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere ,  and we don't know where exactly  but ,  uh .  Right .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well ,  with with with changes ,  because we change it the system to have  Yeah .  LDA filters .  There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also  like , the sixty - four hertz cut - off .  w Uh , it doesn't seem to hurt on TI - digits , finally .  Maybe because of other changes .  Um ,  well there are some minor changes ,  yeah .  And , right now if we look at the results , it 's , um , always better than it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch .  And it 's still slightly worse for well - matched .  Um ,  but this is not significant .  But , the problem is that it 's not significant ,  but if you put this in the , mmm , uh , spreadsheet , it 's still worse .  Even with very minor  uh ,  even if it 's only slightly worse for well - matched .  And significantly better for HM .  Uh ,  but , well .  I don't think it 's importa important  because when they will change their metric ,  uh ,  uh , mainly because of uh , when you p you plug the um , frame dropping in the baseline system , it will improve a lot HM , and MM ,  so ,  um , I guess what will happen  I don't know what will happen .  But , the different contribution , I think , for the different test set will be more even .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  so um ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched .  Because it  in each set you have a range of conditions  Well  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  You  Yeah .  We are playing we are also playing , trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm , in the code .  Um ,  it would be a very simple spectral subtraction , on the um , mel energies  which I already tested but without the um frame dropping actually ,  and I think it 's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction .  Um ,  I d  I don't know .  Well , it 's both both uh , cases can i  Yeah .  So - some of the proposal , uh , we 're doing this on the bin on the FFT bins ,  others on the um , mel energies .  You can do both ,  but I cannot tell you what 's which one might be better  or  I  I don't know .  Yeah ,  but  Well , it gives something different ,  but I don't know what are the , pros and cons of both .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , it might be .  Yeah .

Bro019.D,"so it 's um , Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm , uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra .  So .

Um , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi  and he 's int He wanted to um , look at um , how people respond to formant changes , I think .  Um .  So he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions ,  and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic um , spectrum .  And he wanted to look at um , how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum  and compare that to the to the listener tests .  And , um .  So , I gave him a PLP spectrum .  And to um he he t wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they 're moving .  So I took the um , PLP LPC coefficients and um , I found the roots .  This was something that Stephane suggested .  I found the roots of the um , LPC polynomial to , um , track the peaks in the , um , PLP LPC spectra .  Right .  So , um ,  if @ @ Every root that 's  Since it 's a real signal , the LPC polynomial 's gonna have real coefficients .

So for each  And if you look at that on the unit circle , um , one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency , one will be a negative frequency , I think .  So I just  So , um ,  f for the I 'm using an eighth - order polynomial  and I 'll get three or four of these pairs  which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions .  It 's Right .

Bro019.F,"now we 're on .  Yes .  Yes .  For you it is .  Uh , your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there .  And then the channel number 's usually one less than that .  It - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your  yeah .  So you should be zero , actually .  For your uh , channel number .  So what we usually do is um , we typically will have our meetings  and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits .  Everybody goes around and reads the digits on the the bottom of their forms .  Yeah .  We 're This is session R - nineteen .  Sunil 's here for the summer ?  I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here ,  so that people in the group know .  OK .  We um  So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm .  And um ,  uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds ,  and um ,  I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in ,  but , uh , in addition , we 're running  So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here  and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed .  And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , run things using P - make and Customs .  You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that .  The simplest thing  And I can send an email around  or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something .  Um ,  there 's a c  Yeah , yeah .  Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called "" run command "" .  "" Run dash command "" ,  "" run hyphen command "" .  And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine ,  and uh and run it there  and it 'll duplicate your environment .  So  you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command .  So you can say "" run dash command L S "" ,  and , um , it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory .  So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run ,  and um And that 's a simple way to get started using using this .  And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use .  Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it .  Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has ,  what its speed is ,  what its operating system ,  and when you use something like "" run command "" , you can specify those attributes for your program .  For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute ,  and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that .  So .  You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent ,  all the way down to an individual machine .  Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself .  So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that .  If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up ,  and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there .  So ,  there 's a lot of nice features to it  and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines  and uh ,  right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it  and we 're Uh .  The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it .  So .  Yeah .  Exactly .  Yeah , you know , I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently  and uh ,  uh I fired off a training job ,  and then I fired off a recognition job  and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , "" uh , are you running two trainings simultaneously  s my m my jobs are not getting run . ""  So I had to back off a little bit .  But ,  soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available .  So ,  um ,  that 's just a quick update about what we 've got .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job  right ?  But you probably wanna be careful with that  because um , you don't wanna saturate the network .  Uh ,  so , um ,  you know , you should you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time ,  uh , just because then it would keep other people  ","I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here ,  so that people in the group know .

Bro019.F,"Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt  and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed ,  so it 's sort of a sharing thing .  Um ,  so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time .  Um .  So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use "" run command "" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time .  And uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one .  Um ,  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah , exactly .  Yeah , you have to be a little bit careful .  Um ,  but uh , you can also  If you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use um , P - make  and and you basically write a Make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things ,  and when you run P - make , uh , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number ,  and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once .  And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that .  So ,  I can get some documentation .  It depends .  If you "" Run command "" , that I mentioned before , is doesn't know about other things that you might be running .  So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once ,  and they wouldn't know about each other .  But if you use P - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run  and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously .  It uses "" export "" underlyingly .  But , if you  i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ?  So you could fire off a thousand of those ,  and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running .  Well , if you have ,  um  Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script  and you just had a , uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run ,  and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use ,  you can say "" run command "" and your HTK thing  and it 'll find another machine ,  the fastest currently available machine  and and run your job there .  Yes .  Yeah ,  there are um  Right .  So some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called "" no evict "" .  And if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from .  But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch ,  they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . Automatically .  So which can cause you to lose time ,  right ?  If you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through  and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted .  So . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus the attribute , you know , "" no evict "" ,  and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  I I 'm not sure how that works .  Uh , it seems like Andreas did something for that .  Um .  But  Yeah .  I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY ,  so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev dev console or something .  Hmm ?  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  so , um ,  yeah .  I I can I 'm not sure about that one .  But uh .  OK .  Um .  Yeah .  Yeah , and and also uh , Stephane 's a a really good resource for that if you can't find me .  Especially with regard to the Aurora stuff .  He he knows that stuff better than I do .  Are y are you saying LDA ?  LDA .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  So people won't even have to worry about , uh , doing speech - nonspeech then .  Mmm .  I see .  Yeah ,  I see .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  So , are people supposed to assume that there is uh  Are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ?  Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ?  OK .  Wow .  So the baseline itself improves by fifty percent .  Wow .  Yeah .  Perfect to match .

Um ,  and , um , these these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to to detect these these , uh , acoustic events .  And , um , so I I been I been thinking about that  and some of the issues that I 've been running into are , um , exactly what what kind of acoustic events I need ,  what um , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps .  And , also , um , once I decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do I how do I get labels ?  Training data for for these acoustic events .  And , then later on down the line , I can start playing with the the models themselves ,  the the primary detectors .

Bro021.A,"Sorry .  Um , still working on my my quals preparation stuff .  Um , so I 'm I 'm thinking about , um , starting some , uh , cheating experiments to , uh , determine the , um the relative effectiveness of , um , some intermediate categories that I want to classify .  So , for example , um , if I know where voicing occurs and everything , um , I would do a phone um , phone recognition experiment ,  um , somehow putting in the the , uh the perfect knowledge that I have about voicing .  So , um , in particular I was thinking , um , in in the hybrid framework , just taking those LNA files , and , um , setting to zero those probabilities that , um that these phones are not voicing .  So say , like , I know this particular segment is voicing ,  um , I would say , uh , go into the corresponding LNA file and zonk out the the posteriors for , um , those phonemes that , um , are not voiced ,  and then see what kinds of improvements I get .  And so this would be a useful thing , um , to know in terms of , like , which which , um which of these categories are are good for , um , speech recognition .  So , that 's  I hope to get those , uh those experiments done by by the time quals come come around in July .  Yeah .  I I I was thinking  OK , so just set to set to some really low number , the the non - voiced , um , phones .  Right ?  And then renormalize .  Right .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .

Bro021.B,"Uh .  Somebody else should run this .  I 'm sick of being the one to sort of go through and say , "" Well , what do you think about this ? ""  You wanna ?  Yeah .

Um ,  I I really would like to suggest looking , um , a little bit at the kinds of errors .  I know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much , but sometimes ,  but but , um ,  just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not be enough .  It may be that they 're making them better in some ways and worse in others ,  or increasing insertions and decreasing deletions ,  or  or , um ,  um ,  you know , helping with noisy case  but hurting in quiet case .

So , I mean , again , if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise , you 'd you know , given enough training data you don't do b do badly .  The reason that we d that we have the problems we have is because it 's different in training and test .  Even if the general kind is the same , the exact instances are different .  And and  so when you whiten it , then it 's like you the the only noise to to first order , the only th noise that you have is white noise  and you 've added the same thing to training and test .  So it 's ,  uh  Well , it 's a kind of smoothing ,  but  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , but you 're still getting more recognition errors ,  which means that the differences , even though they look like they 're not so big , are are hurting your recognition .  Right ?  Yeah .  Well , the other thing is that you just picked one particular way of doing it .  Uh , I mean , first place it 's fifteen DB , uh , down across the utterance .  And maybe you 'd want to have something that was a little more adaptive .  Secondly , you happened to pick fifteen DB  and maybe twenty 'd be better ,  or or twelve .  Yeah .  Well , he yeah , he had to figure out how much to add .  So he was looking he was looking at the peak value .  Right ?  And then  Yeah .  Yeah .  So then afterwards a log is taken ,  and that 's so sort of why the the little variation tends to go away .  Or or not constant but but , uh , varying over time in fact is another way to go .  Um .  Were you using the the normalization in addition to this ?  I mean , what was the rest of the system ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Sure .  But on the other hand if everybody is trying different kinds of noise suppression things and so forth , it might be good to standardize on the piece that we 're not changing .  Right ?  So if there 's any particular reason to ha pick one or the other ,  I mean  Which which one is closer to what the proposal was that was submitted to Aurora ?  Are they  they both ?  Well , I mean  Well , no , I I 'm I  Yeah , you 're trying to add in France Telecom .  Tell them about the rest of it .  Like you said the number of filters might be different or something .  Right ?  Or  Cep  Yeah .  So , I mean , I think we 'd wanna standardize there ,  wouldn't we ?  So , sh you guys should pick something  and  Well , all th all three of you .  I think as long as you guys agree on it , it doesn't matter .  I think we have a maximum of sixty , uh , features that we 're allowed .  So .  Uh ,  no . I 'm just , you know , being a manager this week .  So .  The big one takes a while .  Yeah . That takes two , three weeks .  So but , you know , uh , you can get  I don't know if you even want to run the big one , uh , um , in the in the final system ,  cuz , you know , it takes a little while to run it .  So , um , you can scale it down by  I 'm sorry ,  it was two , three weeks for training up for the large Broadcast News test set training set .  I don't know how much you 'd be training on .  The full ?  Uh , i so if you trained on half as much and made the net , uh , uh , half as big , then it would be one fourth the amount of time  and it 'd be nearly as good .  So .  Yeah .  Also , I guess we had we 've had these , uh , little di discussions  I guess you ha haven't had a chance to work with it too much  about about , uh uh , uh m other ways of taking care of the phase .  ","So do you maybe make errors in different places ?  Different kinds of errors ?  I I really would like to suggest looking , um , a little bit at the kinds of errors .  I know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much , but sometimes ,  just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not be enough .  It may be that they 're making them better in some ways and worse in others ,  or increasing insertions and decreasing deletions ,  you know , helping with noisy case  but hurting in quiet case .  And if you saw that then maybe you it would something would occur to you of how to deal with that .  Also , I guess we had we 've had these , uh , little di discussions  ",
Bro021.B,"So , I mean , I I guess that was something I could say would be that we 've talked a little bit about  you just doing it all with complex arithmetic  and , uh  and not not , uh , doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase .  But it looks like there 's ways that one could potentially just work with the complex numbers and and and in principle get rid of the effects of the average complex spectrum .  But  Yeah .  P So .  Yeah .  So I 'm I 'm still hopeful that that  I mean , we we don't even know if the phase is something the average phase is something that we do want to remove .  I mean , maybe there 's some deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do .  But , um ,  at least in principle it looks like there 's there 's , uh , a couple potential ways to do it .  One one being to just work with the complex numbers ,  um ,  and , uh in rectangular kind of coordinates .  And the other is to , uh , do a Taylor series  Well .  So you work with the complex numbers  and then when you get the spectrum the average complex spectrum um , actually divide it out ,  um , as opposed to taking the log and subtracting .  So then ,  um ,  um ,  you know , there might be some numerical issues .  We don't really know that .  The other thing we talked a little bit about was Taylor series expansion .  And , um ,  uh , actually I was talking to Dick Karp about it a little bit ,  and and and , since I got thinking about it ,  and and , uh ,  so one thing is that y you 'd have to do , I think ,  uh  we may have to do this on a whiteboard ,  but I think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you 're taking the complex numbers that you 're taking the log of  because the Taylor expansion for it has , you know , a square and a cube , and and so forth .  And and so if if you have a a number that is modulus , you know , uh , very different from one It should be right around one ,  if it 's  cuz it 's a expansion of log one  one minus epsilon  or o is is one plus epsilon ,  or is it one plus ?  Well , there 's an epsilon squared over two  and an epsilon cubed over three ,  and so forth .  So if epsilon is bigger than one , then it diverges .  So you have to do some scaling .  But that 's not a big deal  cuz it 's the log of of K times a complex number ,  then you can just that 's the same as log of K plus log of the complex number .  Uh ,  so there 's  converges .  But .  I I missed the v  I 'm sorry ,  I was I was distracted .  I missed the very first sentence .  So then , I 'm a little lost on the rest .  What what what ?  Yeah , I see .  Oh , OK .  OK .  Uh - huh .  OK .  Right .  Yeah .  As as he is wont to do .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So , that 'd be good from for analysis .  It 's good to have some , uh , cases of the same utterance at different different times .  Yeah .  I see .  So that @ @ given that you 're using the VAD also , the effect of the VTS is not so far  Do you How much of that do you think is due to just the particular implementation and how much you 're adjusting it ?  Or how much do you think is intrinsic to ?  I have an idea .  If if , uh , uh ,  y you 're right .  I mean , each of these require this .  Um , given that we 're going to have for this test at least of uh , boundaries , what if initially we start off by using known sections of nonspeech for the estimation ?  Right ?  S so , e um ,  first place , I mean even if ultimately we wouldn't be given the boundaries , uh , this would be a good initial experiment to separate out the effects of things .  I mean , how much is the poor you know , relatively , uh , unhelpful result that you 're getting in this or this or this  is due to some inherent limitation to the method for these tasks  and how much of it is just due to the fact that you 're not accurately finding enough regions that that are really n noise ?  Um .  So maybe if you tested it using that , you 'd have more reliable stretches of nonspeech to do the estimation from  and see if that helps .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I I 'm actually just confused about the equations you have up there .  So , uh ,  the top equation is is is  Which is which is the log domain ?  And  but Y is what ?  Y of the spectrum  or ?  No , no .  The top Y is what ?  Is that power spectrum ?  No , is that power spectrum ?  Is it ?  Oh , OK .  So that 's uh  OK .  Yeah ,  OK .  So this it 's the magnitude squared or something .  OK , so you have power spectrum added there  and down here you have you you put the  depends on T ,  ","So , I mean , I I guess that was something I could say would be that we 've talked a little bit about  you just doing it all with complex arithmetic  and not not , uh , doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase .  So that @ @ given that you 're using the VAD also , the effect of the VTS is not so far  ",
Bro021.B,"but b all of this is just you just mean  you just mean the log of the of the one up above .  And , uh , so that is X times ,  uh ,  o  X times one plus , uh , N uh , N N N minus X ?  And then ,  uh So that 's log of X plus log of one plus , uh  Well .  Is that right ?  Log of  I actually don't see how you get that .  Uh .  Yeah .  Uh  No .  That doesn't follow .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I mean , just never mind what they are .  Uh , it 's just if X and N are variables  Right ?  The the the log of X plus N is not the same as the log of E to the X plus E to the N .  Maybe we can take it off - line ,  but I I don't know .  OK .  I i  OK .  Yeah . Cuz it doesn't just follow what 's there .  It has to be some , uh , Taylor series  No .  That doesn't follow .  That I mean , that the f top one does not imply the second one .  Because cuz the log of a sum is not the same as th  I mean , as  Yeah .  Right .  Right . So you could s  Yeah .  N no ,  but  I don't see how you get the second expression from the top one .  The I mean , just more generally here , if you say "" log of , um , A plus B "" ,  the log of log of A plus B is not  or A plus B is not the , um , log of E to the A plus E to the B .  Right ?  And that 's what you seem to be saying .  Right ?  Cuz you cuz you up here you have the A plus B  Plus N .  Right .  Right .  And then how do you go from there to the ?  Look .  OK ,  so let 's  I mean , C equals A plus B ,  and then  Right .  Yeah .  That one 's right .  Oh .  I see .  I see .  OK , I understand now .  Alright , thanks .  OK .  So , yeah .  It 's just by definition that the individual that the , uh  So , capital X is by definition the same as E to the little X  because she 's saying that the little X is is the , uh is the log .  Alright .  Yeah .  Alright .  I think these things are a lot clearer when you can use fonts different fonts there  so you know which is which .  But I I under I understand what you mean now .  OK .  Sure .  Oh .  Yes . I understand now .  And that 's where it comes from .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  OK .  Thanks .  OK . So now once you get that that one , then you then you do a first or second - order , or something , Taylor series expansion of this .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So , um ,  how h  how much in in the work they reported , how much noisy speech did you need to get , uh , good enough statistics  for the to get this mapping ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Cuz I think what 's certainly characteristic of a lot of the data in this test is that , um , you don't have the  the training set may not be a a great estimator for the noise in the test set .  Sometimes it is  and sometimes it 's not .  Uh - huh .  And what are you using for the noisy ?  Y y doing that strictly  Mm - hmm .  And and you and you train it up entirely from , uh , nonspeech sections in the test ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  What is the first variable in that probability ?  No , no . I 'm sorry .  In in the one you pointed at .  What 's that variable ?  OK .  Yes .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So , I 'm I 'm not following this perfectly  but , um ,  I  Are you saying that all of these estimates are done using , um , estimates of the probability density for the noise that are calculated only from the first ten frames ?  And never change throughout anything else ?  Per per per utterance ,  or per ?  Per utterance .  OK .  So it 's done it 's done new for each new utterance .  So this changes the whole mapping for every utterance .  OK .  OK .  Yeah ?  Mm - hmm .  So you estimated , uh , f completely forgetting what you had before ?  Uh , or is there some adaptation ?  OK .  Now do we know , either from their experience or from yours , that , uh , just having , uh , two parameters , the the mean and variance , is enough ?  Yeah .  I mean , I know you don't have a lot of data to estimate with ,  but but , uh ,  um  No , I 'm talking about the noise .  There 's only one Gaussian .  Right .  And you and and it 's ,  uh , uh  right ,  it 's only  it 's only one  Wait a minute .  ",,
Bro021.B,"This is  what 's the dimensionality of the Gaussian ?  This is  So this is twenty or something ?  Twenty ?  So it 's  Yeah . So it 's actually forty numbers that you 're getting .  Yeah , maybe maybe you don't have a  Well , yeah .  But , I mean , no no paper is is a Bible ,  you know .  This is this is , uh  The question is , um , whether it would be helpful , i particularly if you used if you had more  So , suppose you did  This is almost cheating .  It certainly isn't real - time .  But if y suppose you use the real boundaries that that you were in fact were given by the VAD and so forth  or I I guess we 're gonna be given even better boundaries than that .  And you look you take all o all of the nonspeech components in an utterance ,  so you have a fair amount .  Do you benefit from having a better model for the noise ?  That would be another question .  So first question would be to what extent i are the errors that you 're still seeing based on the fact that you have poor boundaries for the , uh , uh , nonspeech ?  And the second question might be , given that you have good boundaries , could you do better if you used more parameters to characterize the noise ?  Um .  Also another question might be  Um , they are doing they 're using first term only of the vector Taylor series ?  Um , if you do a second term does it get too complicated cuz of the nonlinearity ?  Yeah , OK .  No , I won't ask the next question then .  Yeah .  No , it 's interesting .  Uh , w we haven't had anybody work with it before ,  so it 's interesting to get your get your feedback about it .  Right .  I have some .  Uh , OK .  They prefer to have them on  just so that they 're continuing to get the distant , uh , information .  OK . S  ",,
Bro021.C,"Alright .  Um .  Well , the first thing maybe is that the p Eurospeech paper is , uh , accepted .  Um .  Yeah .  So it 's the paper that describe basically the , um , system that were proposed for the Aurora .  Right , yeah .  Um Yeah .  So and the , fff comments seems from the reviewer are good .  So .  Mmm  Yeah .  It 's , uh , Aalborg in Denmark .  And it 's ,  yeah ,  September .  Mmm  Yeah .  Then , uh , whhh  well , I 've been working on on t mainly on on - line normalization this week .  Uh , I 've been trying different slightly slightly different approaches .  Um , the first thing is trying to play a little bit again with the , um , time constant .  Uh , second thing is , uh , the training of , uh , on - line normalization with two different means ,  one mean for the silence and one for the speech .  Um ,  and so I have two recursions which are controlled by the , um , probability of the voice activity detector .  Mmm .  This actually don't s doesn't seem to help ,  although it doesn't hurt .  So .  But well , both on - line normalization approach seems equivalent .  Well , they  Yeah .  They can be very different .  Yeah . Mm - hmm .  I didn't look , uh , more closely .  Um . It might be , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Um .  Well , eh , there is one thing that we can observe , is that the mean are more different for for C - zero and C - one than for the other coefficients .  And  Yeah .  And Yeah , it the C - one is  There are strange strange thing happening with C - one , is that when you have different kind of noises , the mean for the the silence portion is can be different .  And  So when you look at the trajectory of C - one , it 's has a strange shape  and  I was expecting th the s that these two mean helps ,  especially because of the the strange C - ze C - one shape ,  uh , which can like , yo you can have , um , a trajectory for the speech  and then when you are in the silence it goes somewhere ,  but if the noise is different it goes somewhere else .  So which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal , even though we have frame dropping , but we don't frame ev uh , drop everything ,  but uh , this can hurts the estimation of the mean for speech ,  and  Mmm . But I still have to investigate further , I think .  Um , a third thing is , um , that instead of t having a fixed time constant , I try to have a time constant that 's smaller at the beginning of the utterances  to adapt more quickly to the r something that 's closer to the right mean .  T t um  Yeah .  And then this time constant increases  and I have a threshold that  well , if it 's higher than a certain threshold , I keep it to this threshold to still , uh , adapt , um , the mean when if the utterance is , uh , long enough to to continue to adapt after , like , one second  or  Mmm .  Uh , well , this doesn't help neither ,  but this doesn't hurt .  So , well .  It seems pretty  I guess it was  I don't know .  No .  u Maybe it 's this this idea of having different on - line normalization , um , tunings for the different MFCC 's .  But  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah . There  uh , actually , yeah .  S um , it 's very important to normalize C - zero  and much less to normalize the other coefficients .  And , um ,  actu  uh , well , at least with the current on - line normalization scheme .  And  we I think , we kind of know that normalizing C - one doesn't help with the current scheme .  And  and Yeah .  In my idea , I I was thinking that the the the reason is maybe because of these funny things that happen between speech and silence which have different means .  Um  Yeah .  But maybe it 's not so so easy to  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Alright .  Mmm .  Yeah .  W um ,  So that 's it , I think , for the on - line normalization .  Um  Yeah . I 've been playing a little bit with some kind of thresholding ,  and ,  mmm ,  as a first experiment , I think I  Yeah .  Well , what I did is t is to take , um to measure the average  no , the maximum energy of s each utterance  and then put a threshold  Well , this for each mel band .  Then put a threshold that 's fifteen DB below  well , uh , a couple of DB below this maximum ,  and  Actually it was not a threshold ,  it was just adding noise .  So I was adding a white noise energy ,  uh , that 's fifteen DB below the maximum energy of the utterance .  And  Yeah .  When we look at at the , um , MFCC that result from this , they are a lot more smoother .  Um ,  when we compare , like , a channel zero and channel one utterance  um , so a clean and , uh , the same noisy utterance  ","Well , the first thing maybe is that the p Eurospeech paper is , uh , accepted .  So it 's the paper that describe basically the , um , system that were proposed for the Aurora .

","The majority of the group are working on tasks related to the Aurora Project, including on-line normalization and Wiener filtering. "
Bro021.C,"well , there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficients of the two .  Um .  And Yeah .  And the result that we have in term of speech recognition , actually it 's not it 's not worse ,  it 's not better neither ,  but it 's , um , kind of surprising that it 's not worse  because basically you add noise that 's fifteen DB just fifteen DB below the maximum energy .  And  at least  It 's I think , it 's whitening This the portion that are more silent ,  as you add a white noise that are has a very high energy , it whitens everything  and  and the high - energy portion of the speech don't get much affected anyway by the other noise .  And as the noise you add is the same is the shape , it 's also the same .  So they have the trajectory are very , very similar .  And and  Mm - hmm .  I think it 's I think it 's different .  It 's it 's something that yeah , that affects more or less the silence portions  because  Well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noises in the Aurora database .  If if you compare th the two shut channels of SpeechDat - Car during speech portion , it 's n n n the MFCC are not very different .  They are very different when energy 's lower ,  like during fricatives or during speech pauses .  And ,  uh  Ye  Yeah . So it distort the speech .  Right .  Um .  No .  It didn't .  But  Yeah .  So , but in this case I I really expect that maybe the the two these two stream of features , they are very different .  I mean , and maybe we could gain something by combining them  or  Mmm .  Yeah .  Yeah . Right .  Uh - huh .  I systematically add the noise ,  but the , um , noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak .  Mmm .  Um .  Yeah .  Which is not really noise , actually .  It 's just adding a constant to each of the mel , uh , energy .  To each of the mel filter bank .  Yeah .  So , yeah , it 's really , uh , white noise .  I th  Mm - hmm .  Um .  Yeah . So may  Well , the this threshold is still a factor that we have to look at .  And I don't know , maybe a constant noise addition would would be fine also ,  or  Um  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Um  Um  Yeah . It was it was , uh , the same system .  Mm - hmm .  It was the same system .  Mmm .  Oh , yeah .  A third thing is that , um , I play a little bit with the , um finding what was different between , um ,  And there were a couple of differences ,  like the LDA filters were not the same .  Um ,  he had the France Telecom blind equalization in the system .  Um ,  the number o of MFCC that was were used was different .  You used thirteen  and we used fifteen .  Well , a bunch of differences .  And , um , actually the result that he he got were much better on TI - digits especially .  So I 'm kind of investigated to see what was the main factor for this difference .  And it seems that the LDA filter is is was hurting .  Um , so when we put s some noise compensation the , um , LDA filter that that 's derived from noisy speech is not more anymore optimal .  And it makes a big difference , um , on TI - digits  trained on clean .  Uh , if we use the the old LDA filter , I mean the LDA filter that was in the proposal , we have , like , eighty - two point seven percent recognition rate ,  um ,  on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech .  But  and when we use the filter that 's derived from clean speech we jumped  so from eighty - two point seven to eighty - five point one ,  which is a huge leap .  Um .  Yeah .  So now the results are more similar ,  and  I don't I will not , I think , investigate on the other differences ,  which is like the number of MFCC that we keep and other small things  that we can I think optimize later on anyway .  I think  Yeah . I think th th uh , the new system that I tested is , I guess , closer  because it doesn't have it have less of of France Telecom stuff ,  I  Mmm ?  Yeah .  But , we  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , yeah .  I think we were gonna work with with this or this new system ,  or with  So  Right .  Yeah .  But we will use the the LDA filters f derived from clean speech .  Well , yeah , actually it 's it 's not the the LDA filter .  It 's something that 's also short enough in in latency .  So .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And there is there is also this log energy versus C - zero .  Well .  W w if if  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Uh , that 's it , I think .  Mmm .  Oh .

Bro021.C,"Are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation  or ?  Or i ?  Yeah .  Hmm .  Maybe you have to standardize this thing also ,  noise estimation ,  because all the thing that you are testing use a different  They all need some some noise noise spectra  but they use every all use a different one .

Bro021.D,"Yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Hmm .  You mean the  The whatever you , uh , tested with recently . Right ?  Yeah ?  The number of cepstral coefficients is what ?  Yeah .  Yeah .

So , we haven't w we have been always using , uh , fifteen coefficients ,  not thirteen ?  Yeah .  Well , uh , that 's something 's  Um .  Yeah .  Then  mmm  Yeah . Ma - maybe we can I mean , at least ,  um , I 'll t s run some experiments to see whether once I have this noise compensation to see whether thirteen and fifteen really matters or not .  Never tested it with the compensation ,  but without , uh , compensation it was like fifteen was s slightly better than thirteen ,  so that 's why we stuck to thirteen .  Sorry ,  fifteen .  Yeah , the log energy versus C - zero .  Uh , that 's that 's the other thing .  I mean , without noise compensation certainly C - zero is better than log energy .  Be - I mean , because the there are more , uh , mismatched conditions than the matching conditions for testing .  You know ,  always for the matched condition , you always get a slightly better performance for log energy than C - zero .  But not for  I mean , for matched and the clean condition both , you get log energy  I mean you get a better performance with log energy .  Well , um , maybe once we have this noise compensation , I don't know , we have to try that also , whether we want to go for C - zero or log energy .  We can see that .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So , um , I 've been , uh , implementing this , uh , Wiener filtering for this Aurora task .  And , uh ,  I I actually thought it was it was doing fine when I tested it once .  I it 's , like , using a small section of the code .  And then I ran the whole recognition experiment with Italian  and I got , like , worse results than not using it .  Then I  So , I 've been trying to find where the problem came from .  And then it looks like I have some problem in the way  there is some some very silly bug somewhere .  And , ugh !  I I mean , i uh , it actually i it actually made the whole thing worse .  I was looking at the spectrograms that I got  and it 's , like w it 's it 's very horrible .  Like , when I  Oh , I mean  Oh , yeah .  I actually implemented the Wiener f f fil filtering as a module and then tested it out separately .  And it it it gave , like I just got the signal out  and it it was OK .  So , I plugged it in somewhere  and then I mean , it 's like I had to remove some part  and then plugging it in somewhere .  And then I in that process I messed it up somewhere .  So .  So , it was real  I mean , I thought it was all fine  and then I ran it , and I got something worse than not using it .  So ,  I was like I 'm trying to find where the m m problem came ,  and it seems to be , like , somewhere  some silly stuff .  And , um , the other thing , uh , was , uh , uh  Well , Hynek showed up one suddenly on one day  and then I was t talking wi  Uh , yeah .  So I was actually that day I was thinking about d doing something about the Wiener filtering , and then Carlos matter of stuff .  And then he showed up  and then I told him .  And then he gave me a whole bunch of filters  what Carlos used for his , uh , uh , thesis  and then that was something which came up .  And then , um  So , uh , I 'm actually , uh , thinking of using that also in this , uh , W Wiener filtering  because that is a m modified Wiener filtering approach ,  where instead of using the current frame , it uses adjacent frames also in designing the Wiener filter .  So instead of designing our own new Wiener filters , I may just use one of those Carlos filters in in this implementation  and see whether it it actually gives me something better  than using just the current f current frame ,  which is in a way , uh , something like the smoothing the Wiener filter  but @ @  S so , I don't know ,  I was h  I 'm I 'm I 'm , like  that so that is the next thing . Once this I once I sort this pro uh , problem out maybe I 'll just go into that also .  And  the the other thing was about the subspace approach .  So , um ,  I , like , plugged some groupings for computing this eigen uh , uh , uh , s values and eigenvectors .  So just I just @ @ some small block of things which I needed to put together for the subspace approach .  And I 'm in the process of , like , building up that stuff .  And , um ,  uh Yeah .  ","Uh , so the the right now , the the system that is there in the what we have in the repositories , with uses fifteen .  So , we haven't w we have been always using , uh , fifteen coefficients ,  not thirteen ?  um , I 'll t s run some experiments to see whether once I have this noise compensation to see whether thirteen and fifteen really matters or not .  Never tested it with the compensation ,  but without , uh , compensation it was like fifteen was s slightly better than thirteen ,  So , um , I 've been , uh , implementing this , uh , Wiener filtering for this Aurora task .  I I actually thought it was it was doing fine when I tested it once .  I it 's , like , using a small section of the code .  and I got , like , worse results than not using it .  So , I 've been trying to find where the problem came from .  And then it looks like I have some problem in the way  there is some some very silly bug somewhere .  I I mean , i uh , it actually i it actually made the whole thing worse .  and it 's , like w it 's it 's very horrible .

Bro021.E,"pfff !  I can put log of EX plus log  And this is  Now it 's correct .  Well . The idea  Well ,  we have fixed this equa  Yeah .  This is another linear relation that this to develop this in vector s Taylor series .  Mm - hmm .  And for that , well , the goal is to obtain , um est estimate a PDF for the noisy speech  when we have a a statistic for clean speech and for the noisy speech .  Mmm ?  And when w  the way to obtain the PDF for the noisy speech is  well , we know this statistic  and we know the noisy st  well , we can apply first order of the vector st Taylor series of the of the of well , the order that we want , increase the complexity of the problem .  And then when we have a expression , uh , for the mean and variance of the noisy speech , we apply a technique of minimum mean - square estimation  to obtain the expected value of the clean speech given the this statistic for the noisy speech  the statistic for clean speech and the statistic of the noisy speech .  This only that .  But the idea is that  u  Yeah .  We have our codebook with different density Gaussian .  We can expre we can put that the PDF for the clean test , probability of the clean speech is equal to  I don't know exactly .  I I need to s  I don't know exactly .  Yeah .  I the clean speech the codebook for clean speech , I am using TIMIT .  And I have now , uh , sixty - four Gaus - Gaussian .  Of the noise  I estimate the noises wi  Well , for the noises I only use one Gaussian .  Uh , yes .  The first experiment that I do it is solely to calculate the , mmm well , this value  uh , the compensation of the dictionary o one time  using the the noise at the f beginning of the sentence .  This is the first experiment .  And I fix this for all the all the sentences .  Uh , because  well , the VTS methods  In fact the first thing that I do is to to obtain , uh , an expression for E  probability e expression of of E .  That mean that the VTS mmm , with the VTS we obtain ,  uh  well , we we obtain the means for each Gaussian and the variance .  This is one .  Eh , this is the composition of the dictionary .  This one thing .  And the other thing that this with these methods is to , uh , obtain to calculate this value .  Because we can write  uh , we can write that the estimation of the clean speech is equal at an expected value of the clean speech conditional to , uh , the noise signal the probability f of the the statistic of the clean speech and the statistic of the noise .  This is the methods that say that we 're going obtain this .  And we can put that this is equal to the estimated value of E minus a function that conditional to E to the T to the noise signal .  Well , this is this function is the the term after develop this , the term that we we take .  Give PX and , uh , P the noise .  And I can put that this is equal to the noise signal minus  Well , I put before this name ,  uh  And I can calculate this .  Uh , this is the Gaussian .  v  Uh , this is the  like this ,  but conditional .  No , it 's condition  it 's not exactly this .  It 's modify .  Uh , if we have clean speech we have the dictionary for the clean speech , we have a probability f of our our weight for each Gaussian .  No .  And now , this weight is different now  because it 's conditional .  And this I need to to calcu  I know this  and I know this  because this is from the dictionary that you have .  I need to calculate this .  And for calculate this , I have an I I can develop an expression that is  that .  I can calculate I can I calculated this value , uh , with the statistic of the noisy speech that I calculated before with the VTS approximation .  And well , normalizing .  And I know everything .  Uh , with the ,  nnn  when I develop this in s Taylor Taylor series , I can't , um , calculate the mean and the variance of the for each of the Gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech .  Now .  And this is fixed .  If I never do an estimat a newer estimation of the noise , this mean as mean and the variance are fixed .  And for each s uh , frame of the speech the only thing that I need to do is to calculate this  in order to calculate the estimation of the clean speech given our noisy speech .  Yeah .  Never cha  This is one of the approximations that I am doing .  Per utterance . Yes .  Per utterance . Yes .  And th  Yeah .  It 's not  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's fixed , the dictionary .  And the other estimation is when I do the uh on - line estimation , I change the means and variance of th for the noisy speech  each time that I detect noise .  I do it uh again this  develop .  Estimate the new mean and the variance of the noisy speech .  And with th with this new s new mean and variance I estimate again this .  Um ,  ",,

Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect .

I wonder if there could be something like , uh for s for the PZM data ,  uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike .  Uh .

Bro022.B,"I think for two years we were two months , uh , away from being done .  Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .  Yeah .  We were two  we were  Uh , uh , we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point  and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done .  It was very very believable schedules , too .  I mean , we went through and with the schedules and we  Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  It was very true .  Yeah .  So we probably should wait for him to come before we do his .  Yeah .  Yeah .  All in favor  Uh , I don't do anything .  I  No , I mean , I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing ,  but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .  I had another thought just now ,  which is , uh , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did ,  where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy sections ?  Um ,  uh ,  if you  if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values ,  and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum .  So , what what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero  set the negative values to zero .  So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive ,  which is the time trajectory of energy ,  um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things .  And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible .  You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in  So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing .  I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation ,  but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in ,  uh , at n  And ,  um ,  what if you did ?  I mean , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation .  I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .  And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing  and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , uh , very low or or near zero value .  I mean ,  uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh  or pre - echoes ,  whichever they are  are are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .  Be pretty simple .  I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way  so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech .  So , it 's this room .  It 's it 's this room .  So  so it 's these are just microphone  this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on .  Uh , we should do a measurement in here .  I g think we never have .  I think it 's I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T  something like that ?  But it 's you know , it 's this room .  So .  Uh .  But the other thing is , he 's putting in w  I was using the word "" reverberation "" in two ways .  He 's also putting in , uh , a  he 's taking out some reverberation ,  but he 's putting in something ,  because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds ,  which are then being subtracted from the speech .  And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number  and sometimes you won't .  And  So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .  Uh , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things .  I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .  Yeah .  I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio .  So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better .  But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio  No .  Well , yeah .  But it 's trained and tested on the same thing .  ","I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .  I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio .  ",
Bro022.B,"So if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect .  Oh , I see .  OK .  Well , I don't understand then .  Yeah .  Uh , no .  I mean , uh , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing ,  uh , r uh , then I don't see how that would make it louder .  So it might be just some  Yeah .  It might just be some artifact of the processing that that , uh , if you 're  Uh , yeah .  I don't know .  Well , you know , there is this .  Wait a minute .  It it i maybe  i  If , um  Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum .  So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .  So , it 's it 's just a a question of  there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing ,  or something  to make it  Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger ,  but maybe in practice it is .  That 's something to think about .  I don't know .  I 'm sorry ,  was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ?  Oh .  So that was done already .  So we were  Uh , and it 's point eight ?  OK .  OK .  Oh , that 's a lot better .  So , what w ?  Hmm .  Yeah .  But this  uh , uh , uh , no .  Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD.  And these period these typically do have a DC offset .  And and they can be surprisingly large .  It depends on the electronics .  Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC .  But but ,  typi  you know , unless  Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC .  But but ,  uh ,  no , it 's the electronics .  And they and  then there 's amplification afterwards .  And you can get ,  I think it was  I think it was in the Wall Street Journal data that that  I can't remember , one of the DARPA things .  There was this big DC - DC offset  we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it .  And we were getting these terrible results .  And then we were talking to somebody and they said , "" Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ?  Everybody knows that .  There 's all this DC offset in th ""  So , yes .  You can have DC offset in the data .  Yeah .  See , we have a different interpretation of this .  He says it doesn't work .  I said , I think it works magnificently ,  but just not for the task we intended .  Uh , it gets rid of the speech .  Uh , it leaves you know , it leaves the junk .  I mean , I I think it 's it 's tremendous .  You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before ,  and he 's really got something .  Ex - exactly .  Yeah , you got it .  So , it 's it 's a general rule .  Just listen very carefully to what I say  and do the opposite .  Including what I just said .  Well , it sounds like they also have  he he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation .  You know , they have channel adaptation .  They have speaker adaptation .  Yeah . Yeah .  I think it 's probably more than that .  I mean , so they they have I I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things .  So there 's there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models  and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .  So .  They have tied states  and I think  I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here .  But I think I think they they don't just have triphones .  I think they have a range of of , uh , dependencies .  So is that ? Uh , are are these results comparable ?  So you you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits .  Right ?  And  Yeah .  And , so , is your two point seven comparable ,  where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ?  OK .  So it 's about the same ,  maybe a little worse .  I 'm sorry .  You you were HTK .  Right ?  OK .  That 's right .  So  OK ,  so the comparable number then , uh for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the um , two point f  Oh , right , right , right , right .  Right . Right , right , right .  OK .  Alright .  So  He 's doing some different things .  Yes .  OK ,  good .  So they are helping .  That 's good to hear .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .

Bro022.B,"It 'd be a lot of work .  That 's the only thing .  That 's true ,  but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things  because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK .  So , it 's it 's a good idea ,  but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning  first with a a test or two that makes sense for you ,  and then take the likely candidates and go further .  I i Just to clarify something for me .  I  They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .  So does any of this matter ?  I mean , other than our interest in it .  Uh  Do we ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ?  Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete .  Because there 's lots of interesting problems , of course .  And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue .  Um  But I don't know .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  So if you could get at some of that , uh  although that 'd be hard .  But but  Yeah .  Right .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information ,  uh  uh ,  you know , in the old days people would use energy  and zero crossings , for instance uh , would give you some better performance .  Right ?  Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or , uh stop consonants , or something like that .  Uh .  Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech .  And , um ,  just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic ,  some sort of slope .  And and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic  an upward slope .  So having some kind of a  uh , you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,  but it will tend to have this high - frequency component .  Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency .  Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you ,  but it plus energy is sort of  it plus energy plus timing information is sort of  I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then .  So it 's it 's not a  Mm - hmm .  Well , I guess  I mean ,  one could imagine combining them in different ways .  But but ,  I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information .  So .  Well , you can imagine  Is ?  Right .  Right .  And that might not be optimal ,  but  but I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a uh , a probability estimated by each one  and and put them together .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  OK .  This is cubic root of power spectra ?  So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values .  Right ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Uh ,  last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff ?  OK .  Hmm ?  The other thing is  So so , in i i  and  Not  and C - zero would be a different  So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway .  I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with , uh , different time constants .  So ,  uh ,  you could do some normalization s uh , before the VTS ,  and then do some other normalization after .  I don't know .  But but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,  so that 's  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS ,  so ,  uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has ,  ask them their opinion .  Uh ,  I don't I don't have a good feeling for it .  Um .  You you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra .  Right ?  I mean , you can just sort of normalize the  Yeah .  Yeah .

Bro022.B,"I mean , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ?  Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them .  Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are ,  so we can see what should be combined .  OK .  Why don't we read some digits ?  Sure .  O K .  ",,
Bro022.C,"Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing ,  because yo  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Well , well  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well , the system is use the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on on the signal level .  But , not so much , I guess .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Eh  I had a question about the system the SRI system .  So , you trained it on TI - digits ?  But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone .  Right ?  So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate  and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight .  Uh , but is it exactly the same system ?  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also ,  and  all that stuff .  It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well , Aurora system actually  so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits  and it 's a little bit better than the previous system .  We have I have two point seven percent error rate .  And before with the system that was proposed , it 's what ? It was three point nine .  So .  We are getting better .  And  Yeah .  Two point seven .  On the meeting we have two point seven .  Uh . Yeah , yeah .  So , yeah ,  we have the new LDA filters ,  and  I think , maybe I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation .  Uh , eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component ,  or ?  Oh .  Um . Yeah .  Maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits .  I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system .  And  Um .  Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models ,  because this is also one big difference between the two systems .  Um ,  the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more SRI system are more complex .  But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this  and  it was hard t to to have some exper some improvement with this .  Um .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  The vocal tr  Yeah .  Yeah . This is another difference .  Their normalization works like on on the utterance levels .  But we have to do it  We have a system that does it on - line .  So , it might be  it might be better with  it might be worse if the channel is constant ,  or  Nnn .  SRI it 's it 's tr  Yeah .  I guess it 's triphones .  Huh .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  And  Yeah .  Well .  Um .  Well , the first thing I that I want to do is just maybe these gender things .  Uh .  And maybe see with Andreas if  Well , I I don't know how much it helps , what 's the model .  That 's right .  So it 's the clean TI - digits training set .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  I guess you used the clean training set .  Mm - hmm .  Well .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I think so .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Ye  Yeah .  The complete SRI system is one point two .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  It was four point something .  Right ?  The HTK system with , uh , b  MFCC features  Oh .  So  Yeah .  The only difference is the features , right now ,  between this and  Mm - hmm .  They are helping .  Yeah .  Um .  Yeah .  And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone  test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits ,  cuz I 'm still wondering where this improvement comes from .  When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits .  But I wonder if it 's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is ,  which is  TI - digits are very clean recorded digits  and  Uh ,  f s  That 's  Yeah . That 's what I wanted , just , uh  Yeah .  So , just using the SRI system , test it on and test it on Aurora TI - digits .  Right .  Um .  Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet .  So we don't  i i  We would have to train on  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  That 's right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I see .  Oh , so , OK .  Right .  I see what you mean .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information about what 's going on .  And  mm - hmm .  Uh , yeah .  OK .

Bro022.C,"So , I 'm just talking about the the curves that I I sent I sent you  so , whi that shows that when the SNR decrease , uh , the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for some particular noises ,  uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically .  Mm - hmm .  Uh  Well .  First of all , the boundaries might be , uh like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech .  Uh .  So removing more than that might still make a difference in the results .  And  No .  Because we don't didn't looked that much at that .  But , still , I think it 's an interesting problem .  And  Um .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  And actually there 's  Yeah .  There 's an uh , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation ,  uh , it might still be interesting to work on this  because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , um , starting of speech and end of speech uh , at the utterance level .  And  Um .  So  Yeah .  But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both  it it with  Yeah .  So  Yeah .  It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on .  But  Mmm .  Yeah .  So I did I just started to test putting together two VAD which was was not much work actually .  Um ,  I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , um , energy - based VAD that , uh , the other Aurora guys use .  Um .  So , which is just putting a threshold on the noise energy ,  and , detect detecting the first group of four frames that have a energy that 's above this threshold ,  and ,  uh ,  from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech .  So it removes the first silent portion portion of each utterance .  And it really removes it ,  um ,  still o on the noises where our MLP VAD doesn't work a lot .  Uh ,  and  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So , your point is will be to u use whatever  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So , yeah .  It it might be that what I did is  so , removes like low , um , uh low - energy , uh , speech frames .  Because the way I do it is I just I just combine the two decisions  so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based with the with the and operator .  So ,  I only keep the frames where the two agree that it 's speech .  So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they they are they are lost .  Mmm .  But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good .  Yeah .  But  Yeah .  But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done  Well , yeah .  The way I use a an a "" AND "" operator is  So , it I , uh  The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them .  But , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mmm . M Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now .  I just wanted to to see if it 's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem .  And it seems to be the case .  Um .  Uh , the second thing is the this spectral subtraction .  Um .  Um ,  which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , uh , twenty - five experiments ,  uh , with different , uh , values for the parameters that are used .  So ,  it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use an over - estimation factor .  So , we substr I subtract more , um , noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances .  So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors .  And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise ,  and I also try different , uh , noise , uh , values  and we 'll see what happen .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But st still when we look at the ,  um  Well , it depends on the parameters that you use ,  but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise .  Um .  On the other hand , when you subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise  but maybe you distort a lot of speech .  So .  Well .  Mmm .  Well , it until now , it doesn't seem to help .  But  We 'll see .

Bro022.E,"Oh .  OK ,  sure .  So , um ,  last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach .  And , um , we we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , six percent to four point five percent ,  um , on the n on the far - mike data  using PZM F ,  but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent .  And , um ,  wh why would that be , um , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ?  And so ,  uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .  Um ,  first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation ,  and so HTK wasn't .  Um ,  so this ,  um  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization  and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case .  And also , um , the Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters .  It 's got finer - grained acoustic models .  So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio .  Um .  And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio  and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background .  And so that seems like it could be difficult for training ,  cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , um , depending on the timing of the echo .  So , um ,  I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set ,  and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them .  So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech ,  and , um  Hmm .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  OK .  Hmm .  In thi in this room ?  Uh  Y Yeah .  I I I I don't know .  O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized .  So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ?  Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .  Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .  Oh ,  OK .  It w i i it wouldn't affect things .  OK .  Uh  Um .  Did I w what ?  Sorry ?  Yeah .  I  I b  I  Right .  I trained on clean TI - digits .  I I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits .  But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .  I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder .  Huh .  I don't know .  If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter .  And then if you take it out that taking it out makes things louder .  I mean .  Nuh - huh .  The mean .  OK .  Yeah ,  I see .  Yeah .  OK .  So I should maybe listen to that stuff again .  Oh . OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Uh .  I think so .  If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system .  Mm - hmm .  That 's  I  I didn't .  No .  Oh .  And I also , um , did some experiments about normalizing the phase .  Um .  So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at .  And , um ,  the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea ,  um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases .  They they add in this modulo two pi way  and ,  um ,  there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct .  So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that ,  and I subtracted that phase off  to normalize .  But that , um , didn't work either .  And , yeah , that 's everything .  Right .  For with the SRI system  You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter ,  and ,  um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits ,  ","last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach .  And , um , we we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , six percent to four point five percent ,  um , on the n on the far - mike data  using PZM F ,  but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent .  wh why would that be , um , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ?  uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .  first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation ,  and so HTK wasn't .  And also , um , the Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters .  So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio .  O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized .  So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ?

This then prompted discussion about the reasons behind such findings, which were for the most part not as expected. "
Bro022.E,"um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits ,  which don't have this filter .  But I don't think there 's any other difference .  Um . Uh - huh .

Bro022.F,"OK .  OK .  So should I go so that , uh ,  you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?  OK .  Um .  Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal .  So ,  um  Mmm .  I just finished a section on , uh on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a as a middle step .  And , um ,  I hope to hope to get this , um a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan .  Um , my meeting  with , uh ?  Oh , oh , you mean the the quals .  Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .  Yeah .  D - Day .  Uh - huh .  Right , right .  So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time ,  and you have a short presentation .  And , um ,  and then , um then everybody asks you questions .  Yeah .  Yep .  So , um .  Y s  Oh .  Uh , a little bit about ?  Oh ,  the the  Right .  Well , I was ,  um ,  I think one of the perplexing problems is ,  um ,  for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away .  But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with with a reasonable set .  Something something like , um , um like , uh , re regular phonetic features ,  just to just to start off that way .  And do some phone recognition .  Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques .  Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition .  Look at  then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category .  That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions .  And then and then reiterate .  Um , build the intermediate classifiers .  Uh , do phoneme recognition .  Look at the errors .  And then postulate new or remove , um , intermediate categories .  And then do it again .  Um , for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT .  And ,  um ,  then  after after , uh , um , doing TIMIT .  Right ?  Um , that 's that 's , um that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .  Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word .  So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard ,  uh , where I 'd I would be able to , um to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes ,  not just within the phonemes , themselves ,  um ,  and then do the same process there , um , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard .  Uh ,  and for that  for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer  since it 's already set up for for Switchboard .  And I 'd run some some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers .  Yeah . That 's why I I was asking about that .  Yeah .  Um ,  and  I guess that 's that 's it .  Any any questions ?  Um , yeah .  A few more .  It 's a it 's a month and and a week .  Yeah .  Oh .  Hmm !  That 's with the new IIR filters ?  OK .  Uh , gets rid of the speech .  Oh , wow .  Yeah .  Yeah .  SRI .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  ","Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal .

Bro022.G,"Um , what is the reverberation time like there ?  On , uh , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ?  It 's , uh  Oh , this room ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  With the with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ?  I know in the meeting , like  Right .  Oh .  No . The DC component could be negligible .  I mean , if you are recording it through a mike .  I mean , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it .  Oh , OK .  Oh ,  so it is the digital  OK .  It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in .  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , OK .  OK .  Yeah .  Oh , it 's  And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word ?  Yeah .  It 's triphone .  Oh . It 's like the tied state .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation .  And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want  to find a  I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us .  But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore ,  because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation .  So . We don't know what is the type of VAD which they 're going to provide .  With some some gap .  I mean , with some pauses in the center ,  provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .  Yeah .  Then the they will just fill fill it up .  I mean , th  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it .  I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,  then only make a decision because you still need to smooth the decision further .  So that 's always there .  Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .  Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?  Yeah .  Actually , it 's ,  uh  Uh .  I don't know ,  it 's  go ahead .  And it 's  go ahead .  OK .  So , uh  u  th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like .  And there are there were some bugs in the program ,  so I was p initially trying to clear them up .  Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD uh , the initial frames were silence .  It always started in the silence state ,  but it wasn't for some utterances .  So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially ,  and then it never estimated ,  because I assumed that it was always silence .  Yeah .  SpeechDat - Car Italian .  Yeah .  There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .  So that was one of the bugs that was there in estimating the noise .  And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also .  And so the the trend seems to be like , uh , smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR ,  which is like deriving the Wiener filter ,  seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast  using a very small time constant .  So we 'll have , like , a few results where the  estimating the  the More smoothing is helping .  But still it 's like it 's still comparable to the baseline .  I haven't got anything beyond the baseline .  But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter .  And , uh , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR .  So there are three time constants that I have .  So , I 'm just playing around .  So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping ,  so I 'm not going to change it that much .  But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit .  So , that h  And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR ,  because that if  some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values ,  so the SNR is , like , very low .  And  so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech .  So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions .  ","No . The DC component could be negligible .

Bro022.G,"And , uh . So . The results are , like  So far I 've been testing only with the baseline , which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization .  I just want to separate the the contributions out .  So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system ,  which is , uh , just the spectral I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients .  Um .  And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those , uh , Carlos filters , which Hynek had ,  to see whether it really h helps or not .  I mean , it was just a a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps .  And  it 's it seems to be like it 's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter  which is nothing but a four hertz a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum .  So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had .  And  so  Yeah . Just just to see whether it really it 's it 's is it worth trying or not .  So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that .  So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also ,  which I guess I would ask Carlos about that .  I mean , how how he derived those filters  and  and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently ,  or something like that .  So maybe I 'll  Yeah .  Cubic root of power spectrum .  Yeah .  And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .  So it has , like the spectrogram has , like  Uh ,  it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of I mean , the the begin and the end of the speech .  So it 's there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,  because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .  So , those are the regions where there are , like  when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech .  But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .  So .  That 's something I observe using that filter .  And  Yeah .  There are a few  very  not a lot of  because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion ,  so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root .  So ,  I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w  I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters ,  and but while making this Wiener filter better .  So .  Yeah .  That that 's it , Morgan .  Yeah .  I I I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week .  It was mostly about finding those bugs  and  th you know , things ,  and I didn't work much on that .  Pratibha .

Bro028.A,"Eh , we should be going .  Couldn't you t couldn't you , um , test the human performance on just the original audio ?  Oh , oh . OK ,  I see .  OK . So , y uh , your performance was one percent ,  and then when you re - synthesize with LPC - twelve it went to five .  OK .  But  But from this it 's pretty safe to say that the system is with either two to seven percent away from the performance of a human .  Right ?  So it 's somewhere in that range .  Two two to six percent .  In the LPC synthesis ?  I think  So I 've , um , downloaded , uh , a couple of things from Mississippi State .  Um , one is their software  their , uh , LVCSR system .  Downloaded the latest version of that .  Got it compiled and everything .  Um , downloaded the scripts .  They wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run the system on the Wall Street Journal , uh , data .  Um , so I haven't run the scripts yet .  Uh , I 'm waiting there was one problem with part of it  and I wrote a note to Joe asking him about it .  So I 'm waiting to hear from him .  But , um , I did print something out just to give you an idea about where the system is .  Uh , they on their web site they , uh , did this little table of where their system performs relative to other systems that have done this this task .  And , um , the Mississippi State system using a bigram grammar , uh , is at about eight point two percent .  Other comparable systems from , uh were getting from , uh , like six point nine , six point eight percent .  So they 're  This is on clean on clean stuff . Yeah .  They they 've started a table where they 're showing their results on various different noise conditions  but they they don't have a whole lot of it filled in  and and I didn't notice until after I 'd printed it out that , um , they don't say here what these different testing conditions are .  You actually have to click on it on the web site to see them .  So I I don't know what those numbers really mean .  Well , see , I was a little confused  because on this table , I 'm the they 're showing word error rate .  But on this one ,  I I don't know if these are word error rates  because they 're really big .  So , under condition one here it 's ten percent .  Then under three it goes to sixty - four point six percent .  Yeah .  So m I guess maybe they 're error rates  but they 're , uh they 're really high .  So  Correct ?  Accuracy ?  Oh , oh , on digits .  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh , is it ?  OK .  So , yeah , that 's probably what it is then .  Yeah . So they have a lot of different conditions that they 're gonna be filling out .  Yeah .  Yeah . It 's it 's gonna be hard .  Um ,  they 're I I 'm still waiting for them to release the , um , multi - CPU version of their scripts ,  cuz right now their script only handles processing on a single CPU ,  which will take a really long time to run .  So .  But their s  Uh I beli  Yes , for the training also .  And , um , they 're supposed to be coming out with it any time ,  the multi - CPU one .  So , as soon as they get that , then I 'll I 'll grab those too  and so w  Yeah .  Yeah . I 'll go ahead and try to run it though with just the single CPU one ,  and I they they , um , released like a smaller data set that you can use that only takes like sixteen hours to train and stuff .  So I can I can run it on that just to make sure that the the thing works and everything .  It wasn't on the conference call this morning ?  Hmm .  Did they say anything on the conference call about , um , how the Wall Street Journal part of the test was going to be run ?  Because I I thought I remembered hearing that some sites were saying that they didn't have the compute to be able to run the Wall Street Journal stuff at their place ,  so there was some talk about having Mississippi State run the systems for them .  And I  Did did that come up at all ?  Oh , OK .  Hmm - mm .  The only , um , mail I get is from Mississippi State  so  about their system .  I I don't get any mail about  Yeah .  Yeah . It does .  Yeah . I 'm I 'm wondering about that  because there 's this whole issue about , you know , simple tuning parameters , like word insertion penalties .  And whether or not those are going to be tuned or not ,  and So .  I mean , it makes a big difference .  If you change your front - end , you know , the scale is completely can be completely different ,  so .  It seems reasonable that that at least should be tweaked to match the front - end .

Bro028.A,"I mean , that 's th We had this back and forth a little bit about , you know , are sites gonna are you gonna run this data for different sites ?  And , well , if if Mississippi State runs it , then maybe they 'll do a little optimization on that parameter ,  and , uh  But then he wasn't asked to run it for anybody .  So i it 's it 's just not clear yet what 's gonna happen .  Uh , he 's been putting this stuff out on their web site and for people to grab  but I haven't heard too much about what 's happening .  I wonder if it it might be possible to , uh , simulate the back - end with some other system .  So we we get our f front - end features ,  and then ,  uh ,  as part of the process of figuring out the scaling of these features , you know , if we 're gonna take it to a root or to a power or something , we have some back - end that we attach onto our features that sort of simulates what would be happening .  Um ,  and just adjust it until that our l version of the back - end , uh , decides that that  Yeah . Oh , yeah .  That 's true .  And then we just use that to determine some scaling factor that we use .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Uh , w what do you mean when you say "" what kind "" ?  Yeah .  Gaussian mixture model .  It 's the same system that they use when they participate in the Hub - five evals .  It 's a , um sort of came out of , uh uh , looking a lot like HTK .  I mean , they started off with um , when they were building their system they were always comparing to HTK to make sure they were getting similar results .  And so , it 's a Gaussian mixture system ,  uh  I don't know .  Yeah . And then divide the mixtures in half .  I don't know if they do that .  I 'm not really sure .  Yeah , th I have I I I don't have it up here  but I have a the whole system description , that describes exactly what their system is  and I I 'm not sure .  But , um  It 's some kind of a mixture of Gaussians and , uh , clustering  and , uh  They 're they 're trying to put in sort of all of the standard features that people use nowadays .  Hmm .  Hmm .  So is this a histogram across different frequency bins ?  Or ?  So , one histogram per frequency bin .  And that 's  So th  Oh .  Huh .  And and that that , um , histogram represents the different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency ?  Uh - huh .  So they , uh  Is the idea that you you run a test utterance through some histogram generation thing  and then you compare the histograms and that tells you what to do to the utterance to make it more like ?  I see .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  H  What does he do to choose those ?  Hmm !  So it 's a  it 's a little bit like a genetic algorithm or something in a way .  Greedy .  Hmm .

I 'd like to see that ,  cuz maybe I could think a little bit about it ,  cuz we maybe we could make it a little smaller  or I mean , it 'd be it 'd be neat if we could fit it all .

I only  My mind was some  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Oh .  The VAD network is ?  OK .  Yeah . But  OK .  We don't ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  So , you know , in a way what it might i it 's it 's a little bit like combining knowledge sources .  Right ?  Because the fact that you have these two nets that are different sizes means they behave a little differently ,  they find different things .  And , um ,  if you have , um f the distribution that you have from , uh , f speech sounds is w sort of one source of knowledge .  And this is  and rather than just taking one minus that to get the other ,  which is essentially what 's happening ,  you have this other source of knowledge that you 're putting in there .  So you make use of both of them in in what you 're ending up with .  Maybe it 's better .  Anyway , you can probably justify anything if what 's use  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Oh !  That might be the key , actually .  Cuz you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech for that .  That 's a good point .  Mm - hmm .  I mean , back on the second stream ,  I mean , that 's something we 've talked about for a while .  I mean , I think that 's certainly a high hope .  Um ,  so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral thing ?  for a second stream ?  But , uh , how was the stream combined ?  Right . So , I mean , if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there , that that , uh , might be good .  Right .  Yeah . Maybe you just put in some other noise ,  something that 's different .  I mean , it it 's probably helpful to have have a little noise there .  But it may be something else  th at least you could say it was .  And then if it doesn't hurt too much , though .  Yeah . That 's a good idea .  So this is a particular human .  This is this i this is Stephane .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , I mean , it 's  There 's two problems there .  I mean I mean , so so the first is that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation .  Right ?  So it 's not just the noise  but you 're adding in fact some degradation  because it 's only an approximation .  Um ,  and the second thing is which is m maybe more interesting is that , um , if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number .  What if you had done analysis re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ?  Alright ?  So now you put the pitch in .  What would the percentage be then ?  See , that 's the question .  ","we have to reduce it by ten milliseconds somehow .  W It 's it 's p d primary primarily determined by the VAD at this point ,  S so we can make the VAD a little shorter .  Yeah . We probably should do that pretty soon so that we don't get used to it being a certain way .  Uh , but th the two th two thirty includes the tandem network ?  And i is the tandem network , uh , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size  Ho - how much memory d ? H how many ?  Yeah . I 'd like to see that ,  cuz maybe I could think a little bit about it ,  cuz we maybe we could make it a little smaller  Uh , I 'd like to see how far off we are .  But I guess it 's still within their rules to have have it on the , uh , t uh , server side .  So this is a particular human .  This is this i this is Stephane .  There 's two problems there .  I mean I mean , so so the first is that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation .

","The latency limit has been set, and the group's system is performing very well, but is a little over. "
Bro028.B,"So , you see , if it 's if it 's if it 's , uh Let 's say it 's back down to one percent again .  That would say at least for people , having the pitch is really , really important ,  which would be interesting in itself .  Um ,  if i on the other hand , if it stayed up near five percent , then I 'd say "" boy , LPC n twelve is pretty crummy "" .  You know ?  So I I I 'm not sure I 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance .  Well , you 're not doing the LPC  I mean , so so what if you did a  What if you did LPC - twenty ?  Twenty .  Right ?  I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a a really great representation of speech .  So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , uh , removal of pitch , you also are doing , uh , a particular parameterization ,  which ,  um , uh  Uh , so , let 's see ,  how would you do ? So , fo  No . Actually , we d we we don't ,  because we do we do , uh , uh , mel filter bank , for instance .  Right ?  Um , I don't know what mel , uh , based synthesis would sound like ,  but certainly the spectra are quite different .  Yeah , it 's one percent .  He 's trying to remove the pitch information  and make it closer to what to what we 're seeing as the feature vectors .  I mean We were we were j It it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges  because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition .  And , um ,  i if you listen to them they still might not be very Even if you made something closer to what we 're gonna i it might not sound very good .  Uh , and i the degradation from that might might actually make it even harder , uh , to understand than the LPC - twelve .  So all I 'm saying is that the LPC - twelve puts in synthesis  puts in some degradation  that 's not what we 're used to hearing ,  and is , um  It 's not it 's not just a question of how much information is there , as if you will always take maximum advantage of any information that 's presented to you .  In fact , you hear some things better than others .  And so it it isn't  But , I agree that it says that , uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , um , um , a little bit , um , minimal .  There 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away .  And that 's why I was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in .  So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in ,  and see does that is that does that make the difference ?  If that if that takes it down to one percent again , then you 'd say "" OK , it 's it 's in fact having , um , not just the spectral envelope but also the also the the pitch that , uh , @ @ has the information that people can use , anyway . ""  Well , or it 's it 's  Yeah , so  It 's it 's one point four times , uh , to , uh , seven times the error ,  for Stephane .  So , uh  uh , but i I don't know .  I do don't wanna take you away from other things .  But that 's that 's what that 's the first thing that I would be curious about , is , you know , i i when you we  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . You did LPC re - synthesis  L PC re - synthesis .  So , uh and you did it with a noise source ,  rather than with with a s periodic source .  Right ?  So if you actually did real re - synthesis like you do in an LPC synthesizer , where it 's unvoiced you use noise ,  where it 's voiced you use , uh , periodic pulses .  Right ?  Well , it might be hard to do it  but it but but the thing is that if you um , if you detect that there 's periodic s strong periodic components , then you can use a voiced voice thing .  Yeah . I mean , it 's probably not worth your time .  It 's it 's a side thing  and and and there 's a lot to do .  But I 'm I 'm just saying , at least as a thought experiment , that 's what I would wanna test .  Uh , I wan would wanna drive it with a a a two - source system rather than a than a one - source system .  And then that would tell you whether in fact it 's  Cuz we 've talked about , like , this harmonic tunneling or other things that people have done based on pitch ,  maybe that 's really a key element .  Maybe maybe , uh , uh , without that , it 's it 's not possible to do a whole lot better than we 're doing .  That that could be .  Yeah .  But , I mean , other than that , I don't think it 's  ","That would say at least for people , having the pitch is really , really important ,  I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a a really great representation of speech .  uh , but i I don't know .

Bro028.B,"I mean , other than the pitch de information , it 's hard to imagine that there 's a whole lot more in the signal that that , uh that we 're throwing away that 's important .  Right ? I mean , we 're using a fair number of filters in the filter bank  and uh  Hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah . That look  Yeah .  That 's that 's I mean , one one percent is sort of what I would I would figure .  If somebody was paying really close attention , you might get  I would actually think that if , you looked at people on various times of the day and different amounts of attention , you might actually get up to three or four percent error on digits .  Uh , uh  So it 's  you know , we 're not we 're not incredibly far off .  On the other hand , with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually usable in a commercial system with a full telephone number or something .  Yeah .  Right .  Good .  Um , while we 're still on Aurora stuff maybe you can talk a little about the status with the , uh , Wall Street Journal things for it .  This is on clean test set ?  What kind of numbers are they getting on these on the test conditions ?  Yeah , that 's probably Aurora .  I mean  I I I don't find that surpri  I mean , we  W what 's what 's some of the lower error rates on on on uh , some of the higher error rates on , uh , some of these w uh , uh , highly mismatched difficult conditions ?  What 's a ?  Yeah .  Yeah . So twenty percent error rate on digits .  So if you 're doing so if you 're doing ,  you know ,  sixty - thousand  Yeah ,  and if you 're saying sixty - thousand word recognition , getting sixty percent error on some of these noise condition not at all surprising .  Yeah .  It 's a bad sign when you looking at the numbers , you can't tell whether it 's accuracy or error rate .  This is for the training ?  OK .  OK .  Yeah . Cuz we have to get started ,  cuz it 's cuz , uh ,  if the  Oh ! Good .  Yeah .  Cuz we 'll  I guess the actual evaluation will be in six weeks or something .  So .  Is that about right you think ?  Really , we don't know ?  Hmm .  Some  I have to say , there 's uh something funny - sounding about saying that one of these big companies doesn't have enough cup compute power do that ,  so they 're having to have it done by Mississippi State .  It just just sounds funny .  But ,  anyway .  So it could be I mean , Chuck and I had actually talked about this a couple times , and and over some lunches , I think , that , um , one thing that we might wanna do  The - there 's this question about , you know , what do you wanna scale ?  Suppose y you can't adjust these word insertion penalties and so forth ,  so you have to do everything at the level of the features .  What could you do ?  And , uh , one thing I had suggested at an earlier time was maybe some sort of scaling ,  some sort of root or or something of the , um , uh , features .  But the problem with that is that isn't quite the same ,  it occurred to me later ,  because what you really want to do is scale the , uh , @ @ the range of the likelihoods rather than  But , what might get at something similar , it just occurred to me , is kind of an intermediate thing  is because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system , at least in that system what you could do is take the , um , uh , values that come out of the net ,  which are something like log probabilities ,  and scale those .  And then , uh , um then at least those things would have the right values  or the right the right range .  And then that goes into the rest of it and then that 's used as observations .  So it 's it 's , um , another way to do it .  I know they 're not .  I know they 're not .  But but ,  you know  So because what we 're doing is pretty strange and complicated , we don't really know what the effect is at the other end .  So , um , my thought was maybe  I mean , they 're not used as probabilities ,  but the log probabilities  we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a Gaussian shape than Gaus - than probabilities ,  and so we can model them better .  So , in a way we 're taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities ,  because they 're this quantity that looks kind of Gaussian when you take it 's log .  So , uh , maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that .  I d I don't know .  But , I mean , I guess we still haven't had a a ruling back on this .  And we may end up being in a situation where we just you know really can't change the word insertion penalty .  But the other thing we could do is also we could  I mean , this this may not help us , uh , in the evaluation  ","Um , while we 're still on Aurora stuff maybe you can talk a little about the status with the , uh , Wall Street Journal things for it .

Bro028.B,"but it might help us in our understanding at least .  We might , just run it with different insper insertion penalties ,  and show that , uh , "" well , OK , not changing it , playing the rules the way you wanted , we did this . But in fact if we did that , it made a a big difference . ""  Mm - hmm .  And just adjust it until it 's the best number ?  Well , we can probably use the real thing ,  can't we ?  And then jus just , uh , use it on a reduced test set or something .  Yeah .  Yeah . So I mean , I I think that that 's a reasonable thing to do  and the only question is what 's the actual knob that we use ?  And the knob that we use should  uh , uh , unfortunately , like I say , I don't know the analytic solution to this  cuz what we really want to do is change the scale of the likelihoods ,  not the cha not the scale of the the observations .  But but , uh  Do they have the same sort of mix - down sort of procedure , where they start off with a small number of some things  and ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  D Do you know what kind of tying they use ?  Are they they sort of some sort of a bunch of Gaussians that they share across everything ?  Or or if it 's ?  OK .  OK .  So the other , uh , Aurora thing maybe is  I I dunno if any of this is gonna come in in time to be relevant ,  but , uh , we had talked about , uh , Guenter playing around , uh , uh , over in Germany  and and , @ @ uh , possibly coming up with something that would , uh , uh , fit in later .  Uh , I saw that other mail where he said that he uh , it wasn't going to work for him to do CVS .  So he just has it all sitting there .  Yeah .  So if he 'll  he might work on improving the noise estimate  or on some histogram things ,  or  Yeah . I just saw the Eurospeech  We we didn't talk about it at our meeting  but I just saw the just read the paper .  Someone , I forget the name , and and Ney , uh , about histogram equalization ?  Did you see that one ?  Yeah . I mean , I just read the paper .  I didn't see the poster .  Yeah . But it 's a little more it it 's a little finer ,  right ?  So they had like ten quantiles  and and they adjust the distribution .  So you you have the distributions from the training set ,  and then , uh  So this is just a a histogram of of the amplitudes , I guess .  Right ?  And then Um , people do this in image processing some .  You have this kind of of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever .  And and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data .  You do this kind of piece - wise linear or , uh , some kind of piece - wise approximation .  They did a uh one version that was piece - wise linear and another that had a power law thing between them between the points .  And , uh ,  they said they s they sort of see it in a way as s for the speech case as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way ,  because , you know , in spectral subtraction you 're trying to get rid of this excess energy .  Uh , you know , it 's not supposed to be there .  Uh and , uh ,  this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels .  And then they have s they have some kind of , uh , a floor or something ,  so if it gets too low you don't don't do it .  And they they claimed very nice results ,  and  Um , I think this i  You know , I don't remember that .  Do you remember ?  One  One per critical  Yeah .  And I don't remember whether it was filter bank things  or whether it was FFT bins  or  I don't remember that .  And how often they you 've seen them . Yeah .  Yeah . And they do they said that they could do it for the test  So you don't have to change the training .  You just do a measurement over the training .  And then , uh , for testing , uh , you can do it for one per utterance .  Even relatively short utterances .  And they claim it it works pretty well .  I guess in pri  Yeah .  In principle .  I didn't read carefully how they actually implemented it ,  whether it was some , uh , on - line thing , or whether it was a second pass , or what .  But but they That that was sort of the idea .  So that that seemed , you know , different .  We 're sort of curious about , uh , what are some things that are , u u um , @ @ conceptually quite different from what we 've done .  Cuz we you know , one thing that w that ,  ","but it might help us in our understanding at least .

Bro028.B,"uh , Stephane and Sunil seemed to find , uh , was , you know , they could actually make a unified piece of software that handled a range of different things that people were talking about ,  and it was really just sort of setting of different constants .  And it would turn , you know , one thing into another .  It 'd turn Wiener filtering into spectral subtraction , or whatever .  But there 's other things that we 're not doing .  So , we 're not making any use of pitch ,  uh , uh , which again , might might be important ,  uh , because the stuff between the harmonics is probably a schmutz .  And and the , uh , transcribers will have fun with that .  Uh And , um ,  the , uh , stuff at the harmonics isn't so much .  And and , uh  And we there 's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the hi distributions somehow .  Uh , not just ,  um , um  not just subtracting off your estimate of the noise .  So .  So I guess , uh , Guenter 's gonna play around with some of these things now over this next period ,  or ?  Yeah .  Well , he 's got it anyway ,  so he can .  So potentially if he came up with something that was useful , like a diff a better noise estimation module or something , he could ship it to you guys u up there  and  we could put it in .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So ,  that 's good .  So , why don't we just , uh , um  I think starting starting a w couple weeks from now , especially if you 're not gonna be around for a while , we 'll we 'll be shifting more over to some other other territory .  But , uh , uh , uh ,  n not not so much in this meeting about Aurora ,  but but , uh ,  uh , maybe just , uh , quickly today about maybe you could just say a little bit about what you 've been talking about with Michael .  And  and then Barry can say something about what what we 're talking about .  Y yeah .  Gets thrown out .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So i so it 's actuall  Well , it 's it 's much simpler .  But it 's but it 's uh , it 's there 's a lot number of things I like about it , let me just say .  So , first thing , well , you 're absolutely right .  I mean , i i in truth , both pieces of this are have their analogies in stuff we already do .  But it 's a different take at how to approach it  and potentially one that 's m maybe a bit more systematic than what we 've done ,  uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from from auditory things .  So it 's so I think it 's a neat thing to try .  The primary features , um , are in fact  Yeah , essentially , it 's it 's , uh , you know , PLP or or mel cepstrum , or something like that .  You 've you 've got some , uh , compression .  We always have some compression .  We always have some you know , the the the kind of filter bank with a kind of quasi - log scaling .  Um , if you put in if you also include the RASTA in it  i RASTA the filtering being done in the log domain has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of , uh , um , uh , auditory front - ends .  So it 's very , very similar ,  uh , but it 's not exactly the same .  Um ,  I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different  but , um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been um , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints .  So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff , you know , basically what they do is they they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ?  And those filters have different , uh , kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics .  And so in fact they 're multi - scale .  But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like "" let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there "" , and so forth .  It 's more like , you run it on this , you do discriminant analysis , and you find out what 's helpful .  Yeah . They use several of them .  Yeah .  Uh , I mean , you don't have to  but but but , uh , Hynek has .  Um ,  but it 's also , uh  Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction  and they 've done it on the time direction .  I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously  some two - D  and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things .  Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that .  And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting the the , uh the feature selection thing ,  it 's a simple method ,  but I kinda like it .  ",,
Bro028.B,"Um , there 's a a old , old method for feature selection .  I mean , eh , uh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago ,  so I know it 's pretty old ,  uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis  in which you which  I think it 's used in social sciences a lot .  So , you you you you pick the best feature .  And then you take y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it .  And then so on and so on .  And what what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better ,  because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know , if you 've picked the right set of features .  Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it .  So , um , uh ,  here at least you 're starting off with all of them ,  and you 're throwing out useless features .  I think that 's that seems , uh that seems like a lot better idea .  Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features .  Um ,  so the only thing is , of course , there 's this this artificial question of of , uh , exactly how you how you a how you assess it  and if if your order had been different in throwing them out .  I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal ,  but it seems like a pretty good heuristic .  So I th I think it 's it 's I think it 's kinda neat stuff .  And and and , uh ,  the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way .  Um ,  so so that , um , when you come up with these different things , and these different functions , you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector ,  but perhaps you have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth .  And , um , um , um  And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff ,  in which you the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings  and some of them emphasize , uh , upward moving , uh , energy and fre and frequency .  And some are emphasizing downward  and fast things and slow things and and so forth .  So .  So there 's a bunch of stuff to look at .  But , uh , I think we 're sorta gonna start off with what he , uh , came here with  and branch out branch out from there .  And his advisor is here , too , at the same time .  So ,  he 'll be another interesting source of wisdom .  So .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Or the or features .  Right ?  I mean , y actually , you make me think a a very important point here is that , um , if we a again try to look at how is this different from what we 're already doing , uh , there 's a a , uh a nasty argument that could be made th that it 's it 's not different at at all ,  because , uh if you ignore the the selection part  because we are going into a a very powerful , uh , nonlinearity  that , uh , in fact is combining over time and frequency ,  and is coming up with its own you know , better than Gabor functions  its , you know , neural net functions ,  its whatever it finds to be best .  Um , so you could argue that in fact it  But I I don't actually believe that argument  because I know that , um , you can , uh  computing features is useful ,  even though in principle you haven't added anything  in fact , you subtracted something , from the original waveform  You know , uh , if you 've you 've processed it in some way you 've typically lost something some information .  And so , you 've lost information and yet it does better with with features than it does with the waveform .  So ,  uh , I I know that i sometimes it 's useful to to constrain things .  So that 's why it really seems like the constraint in in all this stuff it 's the constraints that are actually what matters .  Because if it wasn't the constraints that mattered , then we would 've completely solved this problem long ago ,  because long ago we already knew how to put waveforms into powerful statistical mechanisms .  So .  Yeah  Uh ,  then it would work .  Yeah , I agree .  Yeah . There 's the problem .  Yeah . Then it would work .  But but , I mean , i it 's With finite of those things  I mean , uh , we we have done experiments where we literally have put waveforms in  and and and , uh ,  we kept the number of parameters the same and so forth ,  and it used a lot of training data .  And it and it it , uh  not infinite  but a lot , and then compared to the number parameters  and it it , uh it just doesn't do nearly as well .  So , anyway the point is that you want to suppress  it 's not just having the maximum information ,  ","So I th I think it 's it 's I think it 's kinda neat stuff .  the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way .  so so that , um , when you come up with these different things , and these different functions , you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector ,  but perhaps you have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth .  ","The group heard of the plan of one of it's member's work into intermediate classifiers, and also of how a visiting research student's work into auditory models can be applied to their work. "
Bro028.B,"you want to suppress , uh , the aspects of the input signal that are not helpful for for the discrimination you 're trying to make .  So .  So maybe just briefly , uh  Yeah .  Be - before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there 's there 's a a pretty nice relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . Right ?  So , it seems to me that , you know , if you take away the the the difference of this primary features , and , say , you use as we had talked about maybe doing you use P - RASTA - PLP or something for the the primary features , um , then this feature discovery , uh , uh , thing is just what he 's talking about doing , too ,  except that he 's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond to these uh , uh , what these sub - features are are are are showing you .  And , um , the other difference is that , um , he 's doing this in a in a multi - band setting ,  which means that he 's constraining himself to look across time in some f relatively limited , uh , uh , spectral extent . Right ?  And whereas in in this case you 're saying "" let 's just do it unconstrained "" .  So they 're they 're really pretty related  and maybe they 'll be at some point where we 'll see the the connections a little better  and connect them .  OK .  Should we do our digits  and get ou get our treats ?  Yeah . It 's kind of like , you know , the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them .  We do the digits and then we get our treats .  OK .  ",,
Bro028.C,"OK .  So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , showed up this week .  He 'll be here for about six months .  And he 's done some work using an auditory model of , um , human hearing ,  and using that f uh , to generate speech recognition features .  And he did work back in Germany with , um , a toy recognition system using , um , isolated digit recognition as the task .  It was actually just a single - layer neural network that classified words  classified digits , in fact .  Um , and he tried that on I think on some Aurora data and got results that he thought seemed respectable .  And  he w he 's coming here to u u use it on a uh , a real speech recognition system .  So I 'll be working with him on that .  And , um ,  maybe I should say a little more about these features ,  although I don't understand them that well .  The I think it 's a two - stage idea .  And , um , the first stage of these features correspond to what 's called the peripheral auditory system .  And I guess that is like a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity .  And I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , um , PLP .  I should learn more about that .  And then the second stage is , um , the most different thing , I think , from what we usually do .  It 's , um it computes features which are , um , based on sort of like based on diffe different w um , wavelet basis functions used to analyze the input .  So th he uses analysis functions called Gabor functions ,  um , which have a certain extent , um , in time and in frequency .  And the idea is these are used to sample , um , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation .  So you 're sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane .  And , um , that , um , is is interesting ,  cuz , @ @ for for one thing , you could use it , um , in a a multi - scale way .  You could have these  instead of having everything like we use a twenty - five millisecond or so analysis window , typically ,  um , and that 's our time scale for features ,  but you could using this , um , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions  which have a lot longer time scale  and , um , some which have a lot shorter ,  and so it would be like a set of multi - scale features .  So he 's interested in , um  Th - this is because it 's , um there are these different parameters for the shape of these basis functions , um there are a lot of different possible basis functions .  And so he he actually does an optimization procedure to choose an an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones .  The method he uses is kind of funny  is , um , he starts with he has a set of M of them .  Um ,  he and then he uses that to classify  I mean , he t he tries , um , using just M minus one of them .  So there are M possible subsets of this length - M vector .  He tries classifying , using each of the M possible sub - vectors .  Whichever sub - vector , um , works the the best , I guess , he says the the fe feature that didn't use was the most useless feature ,  so we 'll throw it out  and we 're gonna randomly select another feature from the set of possible basis functions .  I it 's multi - scale because you use several of these in parallel ,  is that right ?  Of  OK .  Hmm .  Hmm .  ","So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , showed up this week .  He 'll be here for about six months .  And he 's done some work using an auditory model of , um , human hearing ,  and using that f uh , to generate speech recognition features .  And he did work back in Germany with , um , a toy recognition system using , um , isolated digit recognition as the task .  he w he 's coming here to u u use it on a uh , a real speech recognition system .  Th - this is because it 's , um there are these different parameters for the shape of these basis functions , um there are a lot of different possible basis functions .  And so he he actually does an optimization procedure to choose an an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones .  is , um , he starts with he has a set of M of them .

Bro028.D,"Uh - huh .  Yeah , like , uh , not next week  but maybe the week after .  Uh - huh .  Um ,  Yeah . Well , maybe we can start with this .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Um .  Yeah . So there was this conference call this morning ,  um ,  and the only topic on the agenda was just to discuss  a and to come at uh , to get a decision about this latency problem .  Uh , yeah . It 's the conference call between the Aurora , uh , group .  Uh , yeah . There were like two hours of discussions ,  and then suddenly , uh , people were tired , I guess ,  and they decided on a number ,  two hundred and twenty ,  um ,  included e including everything .  Uh , it means that it 's like eighty milliseconds less than before .  Um .  So , currently d uh , we have system that has two hundred and thirty .  So , that 's fine .  Yeah .  So that 's the system that 's described on the second point of this document .  Yeah . But that 's  Yeah .  That 's not a problem , I I guess .  Um .  Yeah .  Yeah . At this point ,  yeah .  Yeah , uh - huh .  Uh - huh .  Um .  Yeah , sure .  Well , it was mainly a discussion between Hari and David ,  who was like  Uh ,  mmm  Uh , yeah . So , the second thing is the system that we have currently .  Oh , yes . We have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent improvement ,  but if you want to stick to the this latency  Well , it has a latency of two thirty ,  but if you want also to stick to the number of features that limit it to sixty , then we go a little bit down  but it 's still sixty - one percent .  Uh , and if we drop the tandem network , then we have fifty - seven percent .  Yeah .  Uh , no , I don't think so .  No .  It 's still in terms of computation , if we use , like , their way of computing the the maps the the MIPs , I think it fits ,  but it 's , uh , m mainly a problem of memory .  Um ,  and I don't know how much this can be discussed or not ,  because it 's it could be in ROM ,  so it 's maybe not that expensive .  But  I d I d uh , I I don't kn remember exactly ,  but Uh .  Yeah , I c I I have to check that .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . Yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah , there were small tricks to make this tandem network work .  Uh , mmm ,  and one of the trick was to , um , use some kind of hierarchical structure  where the silence probability is not computed by the final tandem network but by the VAD network .  Um ,  so apparently it looks better when , uh , we use the silence probability from the VAD network  and we re - scale the other probabilities by one minus the silence probability .  Um .  So it 's some kind of hierarchical thing , uh , that Sunil also tried , um , on SPINE  and apparently it helps a little bit also .  Mmm .  And .  Yeah , the reason w why why we did that with the silence probability was that , um  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So there is the tandem network that e e e estimates the phone probabilities  and the silence probabilities also .  And things get better when , instead of using the silence probability computed by the tandem network , we use the silence probability , uh , given by the VAD network ,  um ,  Which is smaller ,  but maybe ,  um  So we have a network for the VAD which has one hundred hidden units ,  and the tandem network has five hundred .  Um .  So it 's smaller  but th the silence probability from this network seems , uh , better .  Mmm .  Uh .  Well , it looks strange ,  but  but it  Maybe it 's has something to do to the fact that we don't have infinite training data  and  Well !  And  so Well , things are not optimal  and  Mmm  Yeah . Uh , there was a p problem that we observed , um , that there was there were , like , many insertions in the in the system .  Mmm .  Actually plugging in the tandem network was increasing , I I I think , the number of insertions .  And , um  So it looked strange  and then just using the the other silence probability helps .  Mmm .  Um  Yeah . The next thing we will do is train this tandem on more data .  Um  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And and the features are different also .  I mean , the VAD doesn't use the same features there are .  Um  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Uh . Well , there are other things that we should do  but , um , it requires time  and We have ideas ,  like so , these things are like hav having a better VAD .  Uh , we have some ideas about that .  It would probably implies working a little bit on features that are more suited to a voice activity detection .  Working on the second stream .  Of course we have ideas on this also ,  but w we need to try different things  and  Uh , but their noise estimation ,  ","Yeah .

Bro028.D,"um uh  Yeah . Mmm .  Uh , yeah .  But , um , we we did a first try with this ,  and it it clearly hurts .  Uh . It was c it was just combined , um , by the acoustic model .

Right ?  And , um and each of the hidden units is learning some sort of some sort of some sort of pattern .  Right ?  And it could be , like like these , um these auditory patterns that Michael is looking at .  And then when you 're looking at the the , uh , um , the best features , you know , you can take out you can do the do this , uh , brain surgery by taking out , um , hidden units that don't really help at all .

Um , and I 'm gonna to try to to look at those patterns to to see , um , from those patterns  uh , presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes .

Yeah , so so that 's the that 's the first part uh , one one of the ideas to get at some some patterns of intermediate categories .

I mean , initially you may do a super - computer for the transcription , real time and then  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I I mean , ou uh we we kind of set up this concept like a year and a half ago .  And at that time I said , you know , we said , "" don't worry about the the compute power "" .

And basically , make progress on , you know , the algorithms .  And then , you know , it will run somewhere .  I mean ,  as you said , to I mean , we would like the idea to have it there  but but our focus is basically to develop the algorithms , to push the state of the art on this transcription task .  And , uh , the other task probably is also , you know , challenging the comp the the querying , uh , the command , control , or , you know , I mean , doing that in natural language .  Mm - hmm .

OK .  Well , you know , is , eventually y you will get all this you know , sc eh , higher and higher , you know , powers in these portable things .  So as long as you have enough algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power .  I mean , the the situation now in the speech community is that , you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the performance .

Th - Given that the overlaps are up up uh , where the difficulty comes , in a bunch of a areas , um , whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule  where if a person , you know , the that there 's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that to cut down on the  so you then you have the meeting context ,  you have multiple channels ,  you have the microphones n varying the way you want them to vary ,  but you 'd cut down substantially on the overlaps .  It wouldn't be f for all meetings  but whether maybe just sprinkled through there once in a while , something like that might be useful or not .  Just wanted to raise that .  I don't know .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , what I can say is that wha sometimes , you know , if if if we were to have this kind of coordination thing , some some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point  without knowing that other people have the same desire at the same point in time .

But the the thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm probably the one who 's gonna start doing the collection , um , is e is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to a computer in the machine in in the room .  Um ,  and  so that 's probably that 's probably what  u  that 's certainly what 's gonna come out of , uh , of our group first .  Uh um .  And it  Well ,  so , you know , what we 're we 're basically doing is is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do  but it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first .  So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should um , you know , subsequent things .  Try to try to constrain them  or not constrain them .  Or try try to figure that out .  That 's one of them  Pardon ?  Yeah .  e  and it 's all of these things i i is a g  It is exactly these things that I mentioned .  This is these are the main things that I 'm interested in .  Exactly these .  When when do you know when you 're starting and when you know you 're ending .  Yeah .  So .  Right .  So we wanna we wanna look at exactly those sorts of things .  of of us , at least in the beginning , is gonna have a number of different characteristics .  It 's not going to be natural .  It 's not gonna be a regular meeting .  It 's gonna be an artificial situation cuz we 're gonna have to , you know , mock up some back - end .  Um .  So the kinds of , you know the kinds of speech is the speech is gonna be slightly different .  People are gonna be in an unnatural task .  We 're we 're t gonna be trying to figure out how they 're gonna  But  But we will have the , you know We 'll we 'll have all this all the m microphones set up all the same .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  And Yeah .  And if your task is to just sort of , you know , generally do , um , summary and , uh and large vocabulary speech recognition over the thing , then it doesn't matter that much which , uh , that there 's much a difference .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , actually we could do that at our site too  even though that 's not what I 'm normally gonna be collecting ,  but there 's no reason we can't collect that ,  and , uh , then you 'd have a more m your normal kind of meeting .  They 're going to be goal directed .  You 're supposed to  Yeah , you know . You 're supposed to you 're a budget meeting or something  and you have a spreadsheet up there ,  and everybody has to sort of work out the you know , some particular goal of where to p allocate money .  And they can t ask the computer to switch things around in different columns or something like that .  But everybody s  and acs actually a o another characteristic is that we 're only dealing with three people .  Um .  Yeah .  So .  We 're gonna start with just three people ,  yeah .

Uh , but  I don't know ,  that was , you know , w we 're not uh planning to do anything with with all that like right away .  So if there were is there you know , we h we 're happy to take input on that .  And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the i in the PCI card  cuz I think we might wanna go with that .  Yeah .

Your , y "" you know , "" you do this , you wanna ""  but rather give them an actual task .  So actually have  Yeah ,  and they all just have their own they just happen to have their own opinions .

So everybody has things that they like  an and , uh  But a lot of the  No .  None of that .  N no eating during meetings .  Maybe salivating if you 're thinking about the food ,  but it  Um .  OK ,  so the idea is we wanna start off with a somewhat simple back - end  and we 're thinking of , um , agentifying an EXCEL spreadsheet and having s like some kind of spreadsheet  So basically , what wh people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around .  So  we thought that would be a be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing .  So starting off we would start off definitely with a Wizard of Oz task  but it would be something  Uh yes ,  but it would be something uh but everything would be an agent .  And so it just be you know , we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with .  We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with .  But these are all components that are obvious to us how to build .  Nothing nothing that 's sort of far in the future .  It 's just a matter of of work .  Yeah .  So ,  sort of  Right .  Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly  and makes sense how to do .  So a fairly simple back - end .  Um .  Uh - huh .  That 's good .  Yeah .  Great .  Oh , that 's really interesting .  We 're starting off with digit stuff too for for for our different for for this , um , endpointing stuff .  Yeah .  Yeah .  We were thinking something like , you know , ten hours to begin with .  It 's about  Oh , the  Right .  That 's actually , that 's the other thing .  We weren't  Uh .  One thing I should point out , we were n we were not planning on tra doing transcription of the full thing right away ,  u cuz that 's not I mean , I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer .  And so we were not planning on doing the transcribing the entire thing .  But I mean , that 's something to talk about .

Really ?  Oh , sure .  Yeah .  On the language model we 're  uh we 're we 're gonna be using the same thing that we 've done in the past  which is , you know , we need a natural language grammar written anyway .  It 's written in unification grammar framework .  um , but with context free grammar , power ,  and so it 's just changed directly into something the recognizer recognizes off of directly with with no ,  um ,  It 's it 's it 's hand - coded .  Because we need we need to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand .  So it 's it 's a small , you know , ATIS - sized type task .

It is a unification base ,  it 's not it 's not as as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular ,  although the couple of people that we have working on it have HPSG backgrounds .  It 's all up to when I have free time .  Anybody else want to work on this by the way , Horacio ?  Uh - huh .  Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces  but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that to that project .  Right .  Yes .  Yes .  Well , so we haven't even you know , we haven't collected a byte yet  so .  Right .  Yeah .  And we have the same sampling rate .  One one thing we do know is that we 're we 're all producing NIST Sphere files in in , uh , eh in the standard format .  Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz .  So at the end we 're all  And the amazing thing is that even even , you know , the entire way through we 're actually using some very , very similar stuff .  And so tha  yeah .  So ,  Yeah , it 's coincidence that it 's very fortunate cuz  Yeah .  We actually have , yeah , quite similar hardware as it turns out .  Which is ver it 's it 's very good ,  yeah .  Um , so we 're actually  Well  Uh  Yeah .  I mean , all those issues yeah I 'm sure we  I mean , @ @ like I say . I 'm I 'm personally not interested in those for my particular aspect of the project  but SRI in general is is the  Yeah .  And s I don't know , maybe we will end up transcribing stu  if Hor - if Horacio wants , you know , wants that done , maybe that 'll be maybe we 'll end up doing that .  I mean , it 's kind of amazing too that , you know , the transcription tool we just converged on the same  All these things were very , very similar .  It 's  We we we were gonna use the same tool .  We we set up that tool already ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  that 's right .  Uh - huh .  I don't think we have any problem .  I mean , we had certainly in our you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC .  Yeah ,  so we have no problem with that .  It 's terrific .  Yeah .  I mean , s it tho those those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of of trying ,  cuz we are having we do have a more artificial set environment again .  We 're trying something totally new  having people speak to the computer .  I don't think we talked about that in particular  cuz we didn't we haven't done any pilots ,  we haven't seen this , incredibly difficult data of overlapping .  But this is  uh , Christine Helverson , who 's working on this with me from the s um , aspect of user , you know , usability and stuff , would , y you know  sh she 's interested in these sorts of things .  What what can you ask people to do that , um , that they can reliably do and without too much , you know , cognitive load , um , that can help things out ,  or , you know , those sorts of issues .  So ,  I don't know .  Maybe it 's something that could fit easier in in our context than in a general meeting context .  I don't know .  Just have a button .  And ring the buzzer .  Mm - mmm .  I don't know .  We For a t for a completely different reason I assume  but  And and not within a not within a big room .  Just , uh .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  But you need the room and the set up .  Yeah , we 're doing digits  yeah , we 're not doing digits in the in the room set up at all .  We 're doing it for a complete  I mean ,  one of the specific things I 'm interested in is knowing um , is the open mike issue .  When you 're talking to the computer , knowing when you 're done speaking .  And so I 'm loo interested in in well , in interested in looking at prosody .  Um ,  and so we 're just having we 're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know , you know , "" there was a big gap in time here  but , they "" you know , we can tell prosodically they weren't done ,  so .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  right .  Right .  Oh , right ,  just look at the very last look at the very end .  Funny .  And what are these what are the digit strings are from TI digits and , uh  Uh  I don't  Uh  How how long are how long chunks are they ,  a  OK ,  yeah , I 've never looked over the TI - digits corpus ,  I don't know .  Mm - hmm .  Huh .  But the projector 's not part of your meeting  or or or is it ?  Do is this normally gonna be on during collection ?  For ours it will  but we have a rear projector ,  ",,
Bsr001.E,so it 's in a separate room .  ,,
Bsr001.F,"Yeah , that 's right !  Thanks .  So .  There 's a switch on top .  So .  "" On - off "" .  The the wireless ones are actually labeled .  They have a little piece of tape .

Oh ,  but it doesn't actually do anything else ?  Oh , yeah , that 's right .  Yeah ,  I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up .  I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it .  This this thing ?  Or or just that one ?  Yeah .  So  so the  I think  Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  But this is very comfortable .  I mean , I I could wear this without any difficulty .  I  We c we 'd we 'd have to buy new ones .  The the other wa  the other way I had it , which might work , is you put one over an ear  and then you can adjust the other one .  And that didn't that seemed to be pretty  That doesn't work for you ?  So so you see how Jane 's wearing it ?  That seems to work OK too .  And you just have to bring it up .  Well , except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth .  So .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  So .  Yeah , we maybe we should look into if we can buy a replacement .  If they 're eighty bucks , that might be worth doing cuz they 're very uncomfortable .  Well , I mean , what you 'd rather do is nothing at all ,  of course ,  but to get to get a good quality I mean , if if you were listening to it downstairs , that one 's quite a bit lower quality .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Well well try this one on .  I  Well , I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus not for an actual end - user application .  And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not ridiculous .  Yeah ,  I agree .  Training s Training speech recognition systems .  We wanna do both .  So so the the point is that if you if we try , from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything .  You won't be able to align .  You won't be able to segment .  You won't be able to do anything .  Right !  Well , I mean , we haven't done the the detail experiment  but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad ,  whereas these are m are very good .  I mean , that 's why That 's why if you if you use DragonDictate or or ViaVoice , or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these .  There 's just no other way around it .  Well , and as I said , I find this one  I find this one is no problem at all .  The only thing is a little bit of audio a a little bit of audio degradation in one ear ,  and I get a little bit of peripheral vision ,  but other than that , it 's not bad at all .  Those , on the other hand , are very uncomfortable .  So .  That 's right .  So I I guess  you know , maybe the problem is we got the kid 's version .  It 's wired .  Whereas I used speech recognition for about four years using one of these ,  so I 'm used to this .  I don't use it anymore .  Uh , my hands got better  so I stopped using it .  But , uh .  So , for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking  to do all my work .  Yeah .  It was really a pain .  Yeah ,  but I didn't have a choice .  I mean , I couldn't type .  So ,  uh .  Yeah .  In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on ,  "" voice environments for programmers "" ,  but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better .  So  that 's how I ended up working on this project instead .  Anyway .  So so what are you guys doing ?  What 's your project ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Worse acoustics .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  This is this is  The PDA one is very , very ambitious .  And it 's also it 's depending on not only that  Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms  ",,
Bsr001.F,"which is non - trivial .  So .  Right , I mean ,  so so one of our  our back off policy on that if if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link ,  right ?  You 'll dump the the dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere  and you 'll do the recognition .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Well , we we we 've had a lot of discussions about it  and I think  maybe I think t to some extent it comes down to a religious issue .  My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad .  And so if you can get away with it , I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else .  Um , the too many things to cont can go wrong and you lack control .  I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself .  And so the IRAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand .  And so we wanna see what we can do with it  but we 'd also don't want the project to actually completely depend on it .  So ,  the project will go forward regardless of whether IRAM works or not .  Right .  So w  Mm - hmm .  So a  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right ,  so the so for us the Meeting Recorder project has a very similar uh , approach .  Me personally , for my P H D thesis , I 'm sorta doing the other way and seeing how much speech recognition can I do on this little unit .  Yep .  Yep .  That 's right .  So so the  As I said , the Meeting Recorder project ,  so we have people at UW , people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations .  They won't be running on IRAM .  And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  That 's right ,  we don't even know what to do with it .  We don't need to n  Right .  Yeah .  Yep .  Yeah , we don't even know what to do with their cycles .  We w  Like  As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection .  And he has a very good system for that  and and he wants to use this corpus .  So .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , it th what 's nice about  What 's nice about getting this corpus is , i with the people wired you have a excellent baseline .  Right ?  You have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer , to ground truth very easily  and then you can degrade it by using the P Z  you can degrade it further by using those things .  And and really see what you can do with a real system .  So .  That 's right .  That 's right .  Oh , really ?  They 're doing an unknown number ?  That 's good .  I mean , just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are too different .  So , uh , what we what we were working on here was parts of Broadcast News .  And so that that 's a slightly strange task because they tend to be long segments .  But they were they were parts that were interviews that he worked on .  And , uh .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , he had he got very good results .  Right .  Right .  Yeah , so I I tried his on his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff ,  um ,  but of course we don't have any trained neural nets  or , uh  So so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition .  And so , uh , I was using the Broadcast News nets on this data .  So of course it didn't do didn't do t tremendously well .  And then the other problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well ,  his algorithm .  Hmm ?  Right .  That 's right , with all the i interrupts .  Yes .  Mixing ,  yeah .  Like  But yeah , they they have  I think in in  Oh , I 'm sure they do .  They I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back .  Well , but that that 's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters .  Right ?  Mm - hmm .  High involvement .  That 's that 's a  good way of saying it .  So what do we do ?  It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects ,  so it would be nice to work together .  Mm - hmm .  So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data ?  Mm - hmm .  More data is better .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  So what would be nice is if we could , uh , converge on on formats and conventions , and so on ,  and software .  I mean , just  Right .  I , uh uh It shouldn't be done .  Yes .  We 're talking about that right now .  I 'm not sure how much I should say about it .  So that the ,  uh  there 's some possibility that we 're gonna get a third c party company to do the transcription for us in exchange for the corpus .  Right ,  and  We have a little bit of DARPA .  Uh , under the communicator project .  ",,
Bsr001.F,"So so that 's part of it .  And then , uh , part of it 's on the IRAM group .  IRAM group is paying for part of it .  And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds , is paying for it as well .  The infrastructure , yeah , they th they were paid  but they don't expect anything in return .  They 're just being very nice and good neighbors  and  and so they they basically wanted stuff anyway .  And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed .  So .  And to our listening audience .  Feedback .  Right .  We we talked about that and It was  Well i w when I spoke with him he he really just said it was a money issue .  That it 's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue where we 're perfectly willing to give people those boxes .  The boxes are cheap .  Um , but , you know , can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless  and can they afford the P Z  and that sort of stuff .  Well  Oh .  This is  this is the same same company that may be doing the transcripts for us ,  may be giving us  may be giving us ,  uh - huh .  Yeah .  And it would also it would be really nice to be able to do it in other rooms ,  cuz otherwise we 're gonna learn a lot about this air conditioning .  Yes .  That 'd be great .  Yeah ,  I agree .  So so are you gonna m uh , i is there gonna be some sort of mark for that ?  I mean , are they gonna say , "" Computer , bring up a web page on ""  or ?  Uh - huh .  Oh , I see .  I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark "" I 'm talking to the computer "" .  Right .  "" Computer , show me a web page on X , "" return .  Are you talking to me ?  Are you talking to me ?  XML ,  that solves everything .  Uh - huh .  That 's right .  We 're gonna make  Right .  Someone will make some assumption that 's different than someone else .  And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate .  Yep .  So that 's something we should try to  I I 'm not sure what wh I mean what 's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other .  Right .  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Yeah ,  I mean , meetings like this are good because we can actually record them .  Yep ,  absolutely .  Right .  So  When you 're talking about your artificial meetings , i they are gonna be goal directed , though .  So they 're gonna s say , you 're you 're having a meeting to do this .  Mm - hmm .  Oh .  So that will be different .  Oh .  So if  You 're double miking everyone ,  so that 's a close talking and a lapel , and then two environmental mikes ,  is that right ?  Right .  Well , if you ha m u eh  Mm - hmm .  Yeah that  That is , uh .  Yes ,  or drinking .  Y getting getting coffee on these is definitely a bad thing .  Wizard of Oz .  So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it .  Yeah ,  I I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training uh , the acoustic models , without any question .  Oh , absolutely .  Yeah , cuz if you don't the the accuracy 's gonna be horrendously bad .  So .  Well , we 'll definitely need to do both .  Right .  It it really i  It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that .  So .  I  Well it 's  just as an example , I I 've done some very simple digits recognitions  where , uh , I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before ,  uh .  Having people read digit strings  cuz digits are much easier .  Um .  And just combining just doing multis  Yeah ,  of course .  Yeah .  But , uh , just mixing the  just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously .  And I was a little surprised .  Yeah , so you so you  Wh - why ?  I have no idea .  Because they 're a little different .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  And that actually helped .  That gave several percent improvement .  Absolute .  So that , uh ,  I think just just having stereo will help  cuz they 're a little different .  You get a little slightly different estimators  and , uh ,  uh , you combine them together , and you do a little better .  Right ,  so that the  M  So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours .  And then U W is talking about doing an additional sixty to a hundred hours if they have the money .  If they can actually do it .  I mean , that 's what they had said before  but I guess that was more ambitious .  Uh - huh .  Yeah ,  recording it 's easy .  It 's transcription that 's a pain .  OK , but you have to put on a You have to put on a mike .  Oh .  We 're out of mikes .  Don't don't switch mikes .  Don't switch mikes .  ",,
Bsr001.F,"That 's way too confusing .  Mm - hmm .  But if you had the data and we had a a company .  I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not .  IBM .  So we 've been we 've been trying we 've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects  and they don't  it 's hard for them to give us money  but they they seem to be willing to give us time .  And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus .  It would be great .  Yeah .  Yes ,  absolutely .  I think that would be excellent .  Mm - hmm .  That 's right .  Morgan says thumbs up .  Well , and I think that  So al  Right .  Mm - hmm .  So so how are you gonna get dra ground truth on that ?  So so we should  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  But anyway , what I was gonna say is that although we 're not gonna have speech directed to a computer , my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar .  The language models probably won't be .  Yeah , I if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be .  If they know that  Yeah .  The language model will be certainly be different  but  Mm - hmm .  And you 're gonna hand c hand - code that ?  Oh , I I uh  sure , sure , sure , sure .  I see .  Right , if you wanna interpret it you uh need to do do that anyway .  So what 's your time frame look like for doing meetings , actually starting to record some ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well the the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions .  Um .  Well , yeah ,  it 's a it 's ex excellent , excellent .  Yeah ,  that 's right .  I mean , just just just agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that .  Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ?  Eh , good good .  Big endian , little endian ?  Well , but that 's that was coincidence , right ?  So I I think probably the biggest thing would  Well , no  that that wouldn't be true .  If you 're not gonna transcribe it yourself , then you 're not gonna care too much about our transcription conventions .  Right of it .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Well  Well , so it 's a  so it seems like , um , if you and Jane  Yeah .  So if you and Jane keep keep in touch about transcription conventions , that would be very helpful .  Yeah .  Yep .  Hmm .  That 's right .  Right .  It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it .  Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using .  That 's alright .  He can talk anyway .  I was .  LDC is what we were thinking too .  Hmm .  Robert 's rules .  Well I think that  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  There are certainly f formal meeting settings where that 's what 's happens ,  y that you know , Robert 's rules of order and all that .  Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before  but I think it it it certainly is another type of meeting that could be done .  Uh , no ,  I didn't .  I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting ,  so I didn't .  Yes ,  in the other meetings we have .  So that 's another thing we should talk about , is making sure that we 're doing it in the same way .  So I I  Yeah , if I had known and here we have all these new speakers , I could have gotten lots of digits in  but  No , no , I have people read them .  Seven .  Oh , cool .  Nice falling ,  yeah .  So .  Oh ,  I hadn't thought about that .  I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple .  Definitely should .  Don't throw it away  but don't use it in your training .  Cool .  And  Hmm .  Right .  The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich ,  but .  Yeah ,  that 's right ,  TIMIT .  So we actually talked about that .  Yeah ,  it 's plenty bad .  It 's plenty bad just with digits ,  although I haven't trained any nets on it .  I 've just been using existing digits or Broadcast News nets  since we don't have enough data yet .  One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four .  M that sorta thing .  Yeah .  But what were they ?  They vary from  I I just extracted exactly the same ones ,  so .  That 's like the TIMIT sentences .  Greasy wash water ,  oh .  But , so I have a bunch of tools for generating these and for helping transcribe them .  Since you know what you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in , you just have to segment it .  So I have tools for doing that .  ",,
Bsr001.F,"Using X - X Waves , Tcl - TK , Perl , and maybe some C programs too .  Well I I don't have any of the print outs .  I I print them out a a as I need them .

Well , anyway , uh .  Mmm , huh .  Um .  There 's funding , eh .  It 's  No , it 's OK .  Um , I 'll tell you later .  Sorry , listeners .  Too bad you weren't here .

Anyway , UW is getting some funding from DARPA on Communicator , uh , with  and that 's sorta how I got involved .  I mean , Morgan wanted me to sort of do something .  I guess , I My interest was sort of in the language and dialogue m modeling , and the turn overlaps , and how to apply you know , a language model , a dialogue act model to actually feed down to do better recognition .  So not just  Because I think it will be really difficult to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it .  I think you have to have some kind of structure from the  I mean  Yeah .  And  So knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume , you should be able to figure out it 's a backchannel and things like that .  Anyway ,  apparently , and you guys know more than I do , there was some talk that you were gonna build a portable version of this so that Mari 's group  I I mean , there 's not a huge amount of funding in the way , you know , Mari probably won't be able to do a ton of collection .  But I was thinking if there were sort of prototype collection devices or standards , then we could share data .  And we would have like a monopoly on that .  Mar - I mean , once you get three sites collecting data and each site can demo it , and say it 's at the other two sites .  Which was would be really good for funding purposes .

Right ,  and it doesn't have You know , different sides can do different pieces of it I think .  And  Exactly .  Right .  And you 'll get different kinds of conversations and different interactions ,  and I think just having three different sites would be great  just for sort of diversity ,  and so .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah ,  but you know what ?  They don't say when they stop .  They don't say , you know , "" I 'm done , Computer "" .  They only mark the beginnings .  So ,  it uh there are very  Very interesting .  And actually Mari 's  But there might be , uh , neat ways you can do this that are not natural but they become very easy ,  and that  So .  I I think ,  yeah .  But you can still collect the multiple microphones in a similar way and transcribe ,  and th  That 'd be cool actually .  Yeah , I mean , I think the formats would be similar .  But I think having the the idea of the computer sort of in there forces you to create a a log file format that can handle these other devices .  I mean , you were talking about the Penn  and  So  I I think it 's  the formatting is really one of the biggest issues .  You know ,  not not the f transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the sort of figuring out how to synchronize all of these , um , pieces .  And what kind of software you can use for post - processing all of them .  Yeah , which i  Yeah .  Yeah ,  or phone meetings ,  or even  Or meetings like this with about the meetings .  You know , with a with a telephone .  No , I 'm serious .  Even if we don't make any decisions we 'll have a lot of data .  Sorry .  Right .  Right .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Oh , right .  Yeah .  Yeah , definitely .  That was Morgan .  Why why is that ?  Why ?  The microphones are different ?  Hmm .  That  Yeah ,  that 's pretty  Mmm .  That 's  They were gonna  There was a difference in the amount of money awarded from the beginning to e  Um .  Yeah , recording is  Right .  Right .  You can have my mike .  Mm - hmm .  But perhaps the company a company that might , uh .  Yeah .  There  No .  Yeah .  But it , um , and there will be a lot of people to people talk in those meetings I bet with even three people ,  so .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  And , uh , it will really help the design too .  It 'll m keep it from being too specific to somebody 's set up or task .  Oh , do we  Right , right .  Yeah .  Yeah , so we have some ideas there but not enough data to train .  So Harry , and Kemal and I probably  So actually having different kinds of conversations is really helpful too  because to g to make these models robust .  You don't wanna train on just a few people 's voices  cuz then you 'll just learn the their prosodic patterns .  That 's not what we want .  That is from the transcription and from the speaker s segmentation .  That 's not hard .  I think the hard part is getting enough training data and  nor you also need normalization data .  So you 're sort of iteratively normalizing as you go through the  So .  Actually the acoustic may not be either .  So , it 's  Yeah , if it 's very good ,  that 's true .  If it makes mistakes it 'll be different though  I think it  Yeah .  Yeah ,  definitely .  Right .  That 's actually why I called this meeting ,  cuz i I mean , you 're both working on it and with , you know , different sampling rates , and these silly things like that .  So  Yeah .  What ?  Oh ,  OK .  NIST headers .  OK , s  OK .  Well I just made that up  but ,  um .  But that  yeah , yeah .  But you have different na you we 're gonna have different , you know , hardware and and  OK ,  so  so .  Actually that 's the transcription conventions I was talking about this with Jane it 's really important to people at least like me who wanna know , um , certain @ @ uh , who are looking at aspects that are sort of they 're not words but they 're structural things you 're trying to recognize .  And also I guess for the speaker .  People interested in the speaker separation  because what you call a turn and the end of a turn , and that it it 's horribly confused if you don't sort of  It 's inherently hard .  And so you have to make some simplifications  and different people make different simplifications ,  and then you can't compare them at all ,  which is what the literature is sort of like now .  So , um , and then there 's the issue of recognizer dictionaries , and non - standard forms , and things like that that have to be mapped .  So "" gonna "" versus "" going to "" and that kind of thing .  They 're not hard  but  but we definitely will be interested in some language and dialogue .  So .  And UW is also probably gonna be interested in that too ,  the dialogue kinds of things .  So , i  you know .  ",,
Bsr001.G,"Yeah .  Yeah , that 's originally We should thank Jane  because that 's how I originally she showed me some transcripts and I thought , "" Wow ,  this is great "" .  Oh , yeah .  Yeah .  But what if you had like written the s the Tcl kluge or something , and then both done the same  Yeah .  But you still need something that can display these channels .  e e better than what it can do , I mean .  And then I guess  who is the contact at UW ?  Like  Morgan ?  Morgan doesn't have a microphone  but is it is it  I mean Mari and  Mari or or or Katrin , or Jeff , or  Yeah .  I mean , both I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this .  No , on the p on the DARPA project , who would be sort of contacts for Mari .  And if Mari 's too busy then  OK ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I I mean , I think eventually LDC could be very interested in it ,  especially if you have a tool that can do this .  I mean , there isn't one .  And and the data .  So maybe it 'll we can actually  You can sell corpora eventually to the LDC  and you can get time , student time , to clean up the corpus and things .  So .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  But sorry ,  so you connect you collect digits in conversation  or or individ  Uh .  I was thinking  Never mind ,  I 'm getting attacked .  So you don't need the meeting for that .  You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones .  Right ,  OK .  Right , right .  OK .  I I think that 's a really good idea .  To always  yeah .  Oh , yeah .  Oh , yeah ,  d  If you definitely shouldn't use your last sample .  I mean , people that do prosody work , they add a few at the end  because otherwise people will  Yeah .  Yeah .  No , but that that is beautiful  because then you can get this F zero floor for each of the speakers .  Just from that .  Your your junk is our , uh , training data .  No , that 's a really good idea  to have some standard  I mean , especially if a the different sites can do something like that .  You 'll at least be able to see whether difficulty across site is due to , you know , the lexicon version ,  uh .  Yeah .  Oh .  You should definitely  it 's some kind of calibration , uh , for uh many of these tests .  Well , you could have TI you know , "" she put her dirty laundry in the clean clean bathwater "" , whatever .  Yeah .  Have we all memorized these ?  Maybe we know them .  Right .  Eh yeah , you could write write them write something on the board  and ,  I don't know .  Yeah ,  yeah .  Right .  Yeah , it 's way too cold in here .  A all right .  Mmm .  Modern technology .

It depends ,  yeah I 've  No , we got a Japanese version ,  you know that 's that 's it ,  yeah .  Uh the  It 's funny , I li I kind of like this .  So it actually gets most of its strength from from you know , the fact this thing 's stuck in your ear .  And , yeah ,  uh I and originally  Oh yeah , it does .  When I bought those things I originally got this version , cuz Plantronics makes uh you know , an in - the - ear one .  And I really liked it  but , other people didn't .  So it just depends .  I guess , you know , I 've been using in - the - ear Walkman headphones , for you know , a long time ,  so I 'm kind of used to that weird sensation having something stuck in my ear .  But if , uh ,  If you 're not used  Yeah .  Right .  Hmm .  So , yeah .  I don't know .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Yeah , it 's not  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  I was gonna say that , um , you know , in terms  So , Adam has a you know , a particular agenda ,  um , but obviously there are lots of other things .  And you know , it 's the way that a project like this works  so that a group like this where we have students coming in , you know It 's it 's meant to be sort of a long term thing that will get us data  and people will be able to come along and look at different aspects of it .  So it 's not clear , you know , whether s someone at UW 's gonna look at , um , beam - forming or whatever .  But ,  you know ,  it 's goo it 's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it ,  and so it 's We we haven't thought it through .  But that 's OK ,  you know , it 's kind of it 's fair enough .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  You can get the ground truth .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Which , uh Wha - Evaluation of  Of the speaker ID or something ?  And what 's the what wha So what has the data been ?  What what what data are they using ?  What is the  Oh , OK .  Yeah .

That that 's That 's that that that portable thing 's been mentioned .  But that was  Oh , well .  I think I think somebody 's got a unit which is something like the ADAT or something ,  which , you know , it 's a device which will record onto tape , uh , multiple channels .  And so I think that was that was gonna be  and we were g Like someone actually has this knocking around .  Some company that we were gonna uh , was gonna lend it to us , something like this .  The same it might be the same company or it might be a different company .  There 's another company which also has a apparently has purchased a very a big multi - channel thing .  Um ,  and so if we if they could lend us that , we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings .

You mean , you ne  You mean , uh , bu to combining the the posteriors on full band recognition like from from three different or four different mikes .  Cool .

Yeah , yeah .  We we give people a list of digits  and they have to like put them into their discussion ,  like say , "" Five , one , seven , seven , three . ""  Yeah .  But but there is  but there is also this fascinating prosodic thing that goes on  because you what we we have is like these lists of ten digit strings or twenty digit strings  and they 're like one one to five or one to seven digits .  And people read through them .  And you know , we 're saying , well we won't to be able to separate them  so please pause between  but it 's very people don't like doing that .  And so there is this prosodic thing which is which is indicating when whe the pauses between these digit strings .

Just curious .  Oh .  Oh .  Oh , OK .  They 're tough sometimes .  Sometimes the German accents can get a little bit daunting .  I mean ,  um ,  I forget who it was that I was transcribing  but , it was tough to figure out what e e he was saying , uh , at any given point in time  and I would I would just listen to it over and over and over again , going "" Oh my God ! My head 's gonna explode ! ""  like , not really understanding a  you know ?

Um , they weren't impossible  but just like they too the m they took the most time too .  I mean I would take maybe twice as long on a a g given channel w with a speaker who has a German accent than somebody who 's you know , a native English speaker ,  or even Asian  like , uh , speaks an En - Asian language .  I found that easier .  Uh ,  you know .  Uh , somebody who speaks like Chinese or something , @ @ .  Um , yeah  well , I studied I mean , I studied Old English for a while .

I was gonna say that ,  I mean , it 's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of somebody 's voice if it 's the same if , uh , that person 's voice is the same  if that person is the same sex as you . So maybe , like , implicitly people pay attention more closely to uh , speakers of the same sex .  I don't know .  I don't know if that 's actually true  but I 'm just throwing that out there .  Kind of an interesting research project .  Oh .  Me too .  Yeah .  Right .  At the beginning it seems to happen when , um , voicing occurs later  l you know , like  Yeah , with fricatives and with like , uh  I mean , like i it doesn't happen with , uh , like "" buh "" so much  because you 've got the pre - voicing before the consonant actually begins .

It 's like the noisy , uh , um , like airflow ones where you 've got like a a stoppage in your mouth  like , uh , like your tongue  Right .  Sorry .  Yeah .  Yeah .

There might be a gender thing there , though , too ,  cuz I think I think as women it might be easier to differentiate  Well , there were fewer women , too ,  but I I wonder if a man transcribing all the guys would have had  Like if you had transcribed it you would have had an easier time differentiating them ?  I don't know why that would be true ,  but  you wonder if there 'd be like a gender difference there ?  I don't know ,  I 'm thinking about it as like a psychologist I suppose .  Anyway .  Hmm .

Um , I find that I have to adjust the time bins a lot anyway .  Um  Um , not for the end of the utterance but for the beginning .  Sometimes the beginning the person started to say something ,  it 's a very slight difference ,  and then the time bin starts .  Um , so you have to just move it back a little bit .

I would just be so worried that someone would cheat .

Oh , yeah .  No , I totally agree .  Oh , it 's at the top .  So , I have a question .  Cuz now I 'm looking at this and I realize I don't know the answer ,  is ,  um ,  sometimes when people are reading "" zero "" , they say "" O "" ,  and sometimes they say "" zero "" ,  but  And I thought that there must be an indication here .  Oh ,  that "" read O or read zero "" .  Oh , my !  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , you 're not used to seeing the numbers like that .  I see ,  so that 's why .  So it 's optional .

Btr001.D,"OK .  One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was , um , acronyms and technical terms .  Um , because there are so many  and it 's a field that I 'm not really l very  I don't know ,  I don't know very much about this kind of stuff  computers and speech recognition .  I 've never taken classes on it or anything ,  so . I found that really hard .  And I remember transcribing and having a bunch of  You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  but it 's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated ,  once you learn what it is , and you can say , "" OK I know what they meant by that ""  or "" I know how to spell that now ""  or something like that .  And the Cast of Characters that you put up on the Web was helpful  also .  Yeah .  Especially when describing like the set - up in this room , also , and the different types of mikes .  I don't know .  And it 's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly .  They just glide over some of the letters .  They don't fully pronounce them .  So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times @ @ what it is .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Even though I still don't know what they are .  I mean , I assume they 're microphones of some sort ,  but that 's all .  Oh .  About the microphone ?  I can't remember .  I mean he 's e  he he said that they were designed for a specific sized head ?  Right ?  And so if if your head happened to be that size , then you were fine  and if it w was bigger , then it was like torture ,  o or I don't know .  I don't know .  Oh , yeah .  Oh , it doesn't look so bad ,  but , I guess it depends really .  Hm - hmm .  That 's interesting .  Yeah .  Yeah .  For me I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest .  And the German speakers I found a little bit easier ,  and I thought maybe that was because I had I took German for a semester and I 've had exposure to German ,  um , because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language  and  But  And I found that I could  if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , "" Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this ""  and then I figured out what they were saying .  um , but with the Spanish speakers it was  I 've never taken Spanish ,  and even though I 've taken French , and I speak French fairly well , um , I found the Spanish to be much harder  and maybe also because the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here ?  I think  There was a couple of different Spanish speakers .  Huh , that 's really interesting .  I think so ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , he was hard .  Yeah .  And you got to know his pronunciation of them .  I remember , yeah .  Yeah , I remember that .  And and m eh the way he said "" mixed "" was really strange , too .  "" Miss - ed "" or somethi  yeah .  Yeah .  He  Mm - hmm .  Especially because also in the beginning meetings , I mean , he 'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand ,  and then everyone would say , "" What was that again ? ""  and then they 'd pronounce it in English  and so I could figure out what it was  that way .  Yeah .  Like his English fluency got better ?  Oh , I went crazy .  I I would skip doing that portion for as long as I could  because i I just couldn't deal with it ,  and  Yeah .  And they won't know .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I have no idea about Spain ,  but I know that in France for example Parisian French is much easier for me to understand  cuz I learned it  versus France in like Marseilles or in the south or in like the provin like the villages in the south ,  it 's really hard to understand .  Yeah .  Much different .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  And  isn't it Catalan ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's really good .  Yeah ,  cuz that 's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do .  Yeah .  There were problems even with , um , Am - English speakers though .  I mean , not in their level of fluency , obviously ,  but in  Some people tend to mumble ,  and  and it 's hard to catch what it is  is , cuz it goes by really quickly  and you can't really tell  and  That too .  That too .  Yeah .  Or just  I don't know .  And some people tend to get interrupted more ,  I know that 's not something that the person themselves can control  but  um  Mm - hmm .  Especially when they 're when you were using the l the mikes that weren't m headmounted mikes .  ",,
Btr001.D,"And there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking .  And that was really hard to deal with .  Oh , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  absolutely .

Did we didn't do that very much .  You couldn't visually do it ,  no .  And f  Yeah .  And it was very hard to be precise about it ,  and it was very hard to tell  I had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who .  Cuz there 's m so many men and so few women .  The women were easy to f figure out who was who ,  and then the men all their voices sounded the same  except I think there was one British English speaker  and that was easy  but  Eh . Yeah .  Yeah .  An easier time ?  That 's possible .  I don't know .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  It 's interesting .  I don't know .  Yeah .  Yeah , but it definitely got much better when that change happened .

I thought  Shrink in them or whatever ,  yeah .  Of breath or of uh nothing ?  Hmm , yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  With fricatives a lot .  Although I found one in actually I was just working right before this meeting , one where someone said , "" great ""  and  the the G it was pronounced as a K  so it was unvoiced  and then part of the R was cut off in the beginning .  And then  you It sounded like "" great ""  if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like "" great "" .  But if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the the K or whatever and a little bit of the R .  So  I don't know .  Usually it 's not  usually that doesn't happen  but this time it did .  Or "" sss "" .  Or  But it 's not completely blocking the airflow .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mmm , yeah .  Oh it does .  Completely .  Yeah ,  I I don't remember the words exactly .  It 's a shame .  There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle , and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle .  And  if you connected it all together , it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it .  It was written as something else ,  and then it became a word together from what was before and after  and then with this little tiny millisecond pause .  So I guess I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe , there 's pauses somehow ,  I guess  or the you can  Yeah ,  or something like that .  It 's probably like inaudible for us  but  And maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause .  I don't is it That doesn't make any sense ,  but .  Mm - hmm .  On purpose , though .  Or not .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , that is true .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  How it was really pronounced ?  Mm - hmm .  I always get confused with the pronunciation convention .  I get confused with pronunciation , like when there 's a strange pronunciation that I wanna mark .  Because I think w  m may di in the beginning did we do the strange pronunciation and then write PRN and what it really was meant to be ?  And now we 're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets what it sounded like ?  We did a switch , right ?  Or not .  I don't know if it 's just me that 's confused or if it was swi  OK .  OK .  So the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little apostrophe , or whatever you call it ,  and then "" PRN "" ,  how it 's pronounced .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  He does it a lot .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Or "" a "" versus "" a "" .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  There 's a study done on when people say "" uh "" and when people say "" um "" .  Also , there 's contec in concet contextual variation ,  and it 's predictable apparently ,  I haven't read the  It 's really interesting .  Yeah .  Yeah .  You know , what 's On that sort of similar topic , I just thought of something that 's been hard for me sometimes , is you can have a pronunciation of of the word "" a "" as "" a "" .  And then you can have "" uh "" like a pause or whatever as "" uh "" ,  and sometimes it 's hard to tell what the person meant .  Are did they mean "" uh "" like they 're pausing  or did they mean "" a "" like "" a person "" ?  Yeah .  And  ",,

And I think that I would lose my  I don't know ,  I would not be as thorough ,  not be as careful .  Mm - hmm .  It was more personal .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .

And time bin corrections and things ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  One thing that 's annoying I think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it 's their turn to give their little report or whatever .  And yet you have to check the channels for if they did backchannels or if they did other things that you need to encode that weren't on the pre - segmenter .  But sometimes it 's not visually easy .  And so  I 'm  Sometime I debate with myself whether it 's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually .  It 's hard to decide sometimes .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  And s  Yeah ,  that 's the thing .  i that 's the thing that makes it harder sometimes .  Yeah .  Yeah .  You mean the transcribers ?

Just like , "" Oh , that 's interesting "" ,  or something like that .  Yeah ,  you 're about to s speak .  But then they don't .  Yeah .  And sometimes even laughs .  Uh - huh .  Uh - huh .

One thing that I I 'm you probably don't remember this that I was really interested in is the use of "" so "" and the use of "" or "" .  Because the way people use it in these meetings , I found , was  I don't know if it was it if it 's different than other people .  I don't know if it 's a computer speech thing .  I mean , computer people speech thing ,  but um ,  people tend to end utterances quite often with "" so "" or "" or "" and trailing off .  Yeah ,  mm - hmm .  And I found that really interesting ,  and I was curious to to figure out when that happened ,  if it happened in certain occasions and whatever ,  and I never really got around to it ,  but .  It didn't sound stran  I mean , it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand .  But I don't think it 's something that happens in just everyday speech really .  Really ?  Really ?  Huh .  Yeah .  Like that you 're flexible ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , but it tends to happen  I mean , "" so "" tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying .  Or at least that 's what I found .  Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something either a new topic or a different take on the same topic will tend to use will trail off with "" so "" .  Yeah ,  kind of ,  yeah , yeah .  Yeah .  And "" or "" tends to be used with questions more than So .  But .  I thought that was really interesting .  When you end the utterance .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I 'd definitely like to look more at that if I can ,  but .  Oh , yeah .  Mm - hmm .  "" But I 'm not really sure  so you can you could finish my thought . ""  It 's a different kind of shrug though .  I think it shows less of confident like less confidence in what they just said  in a way .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  More similar than to "" so "" I think .  Yeah .  Or maybe it 's just a link to get back to the conversation or something ?  Like to connect it with what is going on elsewhere ?  Oh , like kind of kind of laughing with it  in a way ?  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mmm .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Maybe it means that .  Uh .  Maybe if maybe it 's when people don't laugh enough or something .  I don't know .  Right .  Giving them permission to  I don't know about permission .  To keep going with the meeting .  Yeah .  Cuz sometimes you can get on digressions that just last for like minutes at a time .  ",,
Btr001.D,"And people are just hysterical  and they 're like , "" What were we talking about ?  I don't know "" .  It 's hard when people get really really in like into their laughing and start talking at the same time .  It 's hard to figure out what they 're doi what they 're talking about ,  and also they don't tend to talk very f  there 's a lot of disfluencies when they 're laughing and talking .

You kno  it was i j I just think that , um , her fluency in English wasn't wa um , wasn't very very high up there ,  so it was really difficult .  But , I mean , I did find that knowing Spanish helped me a lot .  I could tell that a lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses , I was like , "" I can see how you how you couldn't understand that "" ,  but I c I kn I think I know what she 's doing .

I mean , I usually ended adjusting them a little bit  I mean ,  definitely when something 's cut off at the beginning or the end  but also sometimes there 's just like huge pads of , you know , air before and or after , um , that I don't really feel is necessary for that segment ,  and I usually , um , you know , shrink it a bit  and make it a little bit  Just nothing ,  yeah .

Do we have batteries back there ?  OK .  OK .  And you 'll be in your office during this ?  Oh , thank you very much .  Thanks a lot .  Appreciate it .  Could you close the door for me please ?  OK , thanks .  So ,  thanks very much for coming .  OK .  So um  let 's see ,  so , um , as you know , the meeting today is to , um , @ @ benefit from your involvement in the data ,  all the things that that you 've been exposed to in these many months .  And um , I just I just put down some ideas  you 've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier .  And , um ,  none of these these are not obligatory toca topics  but they 're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss ,  just as a way of organizing the discussion .  But if there are other topics you 'd like to discuss that 'd be great too .  Alright ,  so um ,  it struck me that , um , you know , we could start out with some sort of general thing about , um , things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or , uh , dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type .  And then , maybe talk about specifics specifics of the data  and then maybe talk about , um , aspects of the conventions  and then the technical set - up regarding the , um , auditory image and the interface .  OK ,  so ,  maybe we could just , um , start with issues of the @ @ the tar ti up there at the top of  What what did you find easiest or more s most difficult about transcribing the data ?  Yeah .  Parentheses , meaning uncertainty .  Mm - hmm .  Is  OK ,  good .  It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ?  It 's basically you have these specialized terms for things that I didn't know n needed specialized terms .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  That 's not a bad strategy .  I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage  and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context .  Not a bad strategy .  Yeah .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  I suspect in context .  And also when you have the the juxtaposition of PDA and PZM then , you know , you @ @ in context you can tell which one it 's is probably likely to be the one that you had .  Well these here are the P Z  that right there .  Uh you 've heard , the "" crown of pain "" .  No . He was telling us , uh , before the meeting that , um , that they 're not in circulation right now ,  that they 're they were unpopular .  I liked them ,  and Adam liked them .  I thought the quality was good .  What  yeah , what did he say ?  He said some more things about that ,  but I was n I was working on something else .  Uh - huh .  Ah , yeah .  Yeah , that 's right .  That 's right .  Yeah ,  it 's  I liked them .  And there 's the actually , there 's the picture of the of the Crown adjustment on the wall right there .  So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back .  Yeah , good c  Yeah .  OK ,  so now what about accents ?  Do you have , uh Did you find any p  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  What 's  you 've studied some languages ,  which which ones do you are you studying ?  It 's more of a Romance direction ,  or ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm ,  so it 's not really you 're not really exposed to German very much .  Ah ! Interesting .  Interesting .  Huh .  OK .  I it 's a good question .  Um ,  And I can't really answer that .  Oh .  Oh , that 's fascinating .  Well , what you can see is that it 's it 's her lack of of English fluency that 's being  Yeah , that 's that 's really interesting .  I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others  because of my c exposure and interest in German .  But , um ,  I suspect you haven't  because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of  actually she she was in the middle phase I would say .  We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult .  But that 's really interesting .  Yes . Yes yes yes .  Uh - huh .  Ex  exactly .  "" Miss - ed "" .  Uh - huh .  Which was you know , you could predict it ,  I mean , if you knew look looked back at it ,  they  Yeah ,  interesting .  OK .  Yeah , I had the same experience .  Sometimes  And actually  Sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , "" What did you say there ? ""  and they can't tell you .  ",,
Btr001.F,"S I think it 's it 's sort of a general variability when it 's not when you 're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level .  I also wonder if if it 's partly that Span - Spanish has different pronunciations in different regions ?  I mean , do you think that , um , that , uh , maybe  I mean , being  I mean , not that I would know that .  But I just wondered if ,  um  you know , she was from probably continental Spain versus @ @ y you know other Spanish  I wonder if that would have a a contributing factor .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  That 's right .  And in my case with with , uh , German w I a certain region that I do well in  and then get farther away from that region  and I notice it 's more and more difficult .  Yeah .  But she was also very low volume .  And , um and didn't say a lot .  I mean , I I I c I totally agree .  This was a a difficult person to to understand .  But .  I can imagine that ,  yeah .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish .  I 've I found myself doing that somewhat in in German .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  That 's right .  Or they 're laughing when they 're talking  or they 're  Oh .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  we had lapels for d l brief  And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks ,  which would mean really basically u uh , a problem that you 're saying of getting input from others ,  and also , um , it varying when they change their hea w head position .  Yeah ,  but  Oh , excellent .  Oh , good to know .  S  so that was You 're talking about early on , the change fro into Channeltrans ?  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm ,  that 's right .  Overlaps .  That 's interesting .  It 's possible .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Huh .  Yeah ,  it seems like it 's it 's related to this production idea .  How you you internalize what you 're externalizing in a way ,  but .  Yeah .  In the prev  You 've also gone through  They 've been here since the beginning .  You 've also gone through the use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing .  So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I see .  Mm - hmm .  It doesn't hurt to have a pad .  It 's it 's nicer to have a pad than not ,  d but s don't have to be really Yeah , don't doesn't have to be  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Nice .  Nice .  I  Ah .  Have you  Well , I 'm I 'm sort of a hybrid ,  so I I you know , I I appreciate having them do this ,  yeah .  So , um , in did you have you run into places  I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin .  Have you had that happen ?  That 's fascinating .  Oh , it 's really a kick .  Yeah .  There are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of .  You 're  i it 's h  Well ,  it ge u I 'm sure sometimes on purpose ,  but sometimes it 'd just be s saying something and especially people who have really lo elongation in their style ,  and they say , "" That 's really fascinating ""  It 's not a great example ,  but you know ?  And  Yeah .  Uh there 's  it 's it 's funny how , um ,  i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes  and I 've run across that also .  What I 've done I 've  It 's very rare . I mean , when I 've run across it .  And , you know , maybe there are times that I haven't detected it  and I 'm not @ @ you know , fin I haven't looked at everything .  I 've looked at I 've probably looked at per uh s at least eighty percent of the data ,  you know , all the way through e every meeting for about eighty percent of the stuff that I 've cleared so far .  And , um ,  i it s You guys are getting so good that it 's like I 'm I I i I can get through them faster , and I 'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way ,  you know ,  so it 's like it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great , of , um , of of pre precision that um , it takes a lot of a load off of me .  And , um  and so I 'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the @ @ for throughout the whole rest of the project .  But , um  Certainly have spot checking .  But , um , hhh , those that I have found that way , to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation .  ",,
Btr001.F,"So just do a you know , a mark , then "" fascinating "" , and then put "" PRN "" and uh "" interrupted by a pause "" or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know .  You know , "" P R dot dot fascinating "" , whatever it is .  Sorry , what was this ?  OK .  Well , I 've  There was an adjustment ,  and I and I 've switched them all all the way at this point so that  Yeah .  Yep .  Mm - hmm , that 's right .  And then in the brackets , what it  Uh - huh .  So i you know , "" OK "" is a very e easy example .  A person says , "" Mm - kay ""  then ,  it 's "" OK "" with a ha a little hatch  and then , "" PRN "" and then "" m mm - kay "" , or whatever it is in quotes .  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah , that 's right .  And of course , you know I mean , there 's also this other reduction that w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says "" and "" versus "" nnn "" versus , you know , "" nd "" , whatever  all the different ways of reducing "" and "" .  Because you can assume that the speech recognition , um , uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types ,  and the same thing for , um , well "" the "" . "" The "" versus "" the ""  that there are those known variants , and  Exactly .  And that they should be able to handle themselves ,  and and that we assume also that for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now ,  and those distinctions could be added later if needed  but it 's unlikely that they would be .  And it 's so time - consuming .  So we 've made these these simplifying assumptions with that ,  and so then you begin to think , "" Well what about "" OK "" ?  I mean , maybe "" mm - kay "" is an appropriate variant for "" OK ""  and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either ,  so it 's it 's definitely there 's a , uh , choice of how far you go with that , and whether "" kay "" is is enough of a variant  you know , it 's th this is a case where , um , I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things  but I I sort of figure that i @ @ that that 's not as far aw away from "" OK "" as "" mm - kay "" is ,  so it 's not quite so  but I don't change it back if it 's there ,  you know .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm ,  interesting .  Oh , that 's interesting .  Huh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Once in a while .  Yes .  Yeah , I  I agree .  And and when I when I 'm totally in doubt , if there 's a case where it really could be either , and I could flip a coin , I 'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense ,  give them the benefit of the doubt that they 're being fluent about it .  Mm - hmm .  It must be really rare though ,  I haven't run across that often .  Ha - ha h Is it rare ?  OK .  OK . Well , le let 's see now ,  there 's another another methodo  what I go I wanna ask you at some point , it just occurred to me , I 'd like to ask you the following question , maybe you can have this in the back of your minds , something like , um , you know , what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know , ti trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things .  What kind of , uh , hypotheses have has this caused you  uh , I mean , don't wanna have you give away a paper topic that you wanna explore ,  but ,  you know , if there 's interesting th uh , hypotheses that the that y have been suggested to you by looking at the data .  That kinda thing , maybe , uh , at some point .  So ,  and al Oh ! And I also wanna say , that , um , I 'd like to meet again also next week ,  um , and I don't know if this is a good time frame ,  uh , maybe it 'd be good to have it an hour later  or I don't know I mean , could do anything  about  Good time for you ?  OK .  OK .  OK .  Excellent ,  cuz we could probably move it one hour later ,  I mean I think , u unless  Oh , I see .  Wow .  You did really well .  Yeah .  Oh , did you ?  OK , OK .  Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ?  OK .  And th the final question i  Oh , that 's right !  Oh ! I thought she said "" mistreat time "" .  Yeah , you know , that 's that 's that 's an interesting  Hey , they would .  Yeah , they would .  That 's that 's not a bad solution .  Yeah , that 's right ,  it 's already done .  It 's good to s good to have these things all scheduled .  OK ,  so um  Oh ,  ",,
Btr001.F,"uh , eh then I was gonna ask you , what about an hour later ?  I mean , if we h had those things an hour later  like , would people  OK ?  OK , good .  Alright , so , I 'll I 'll so settle on that .  OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation .  There was another impro another improvement in that  Well , s let 's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint .  Uh , the Tigerfish , um , approach .  So ,  uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves .  Ho - ho how Have you  And so I think you Yeah , I think you Did you  has there already been t  Yeah , IBM or if if it was dash TF ,  that 's the Tigerfish .  So d  There 's a lot of that .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  that 's right too .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Exactly .  Exactly ,  I 'm glad you  Yeah , exactly .  Yeah .  Oh , good to know .  Oh , that 's helpful .  OK .  Wow .  Wow !  Wow ,  OK .  Mm - hmm .  I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one .  So this was earlier on .  You probably do .  So you didn't get one ?  Oh , interesting .  No .  In neither case .  And I 'm and I 'm thinking I 'm thinking you 're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the what they got  and IBM didn't  Yeah .  There 's also some i iffiness about how d if  We 're not sure really how Tigerfish does it ,  you know , the methodology .  How do they do this .  Because sometimes you 'll have the s the same word ,  and I 've seen this , like , within  well , within a single turn , l it 'll be spelled in three different ways .  And it 's like , you know , is this the same person who 's kind of forgetful ,  or is it that they have several people doing it together ?  You know , maybe it 's parallel .  Maybe they 're all doing it in parallel  and one falls behind and the other one  But , who knows ?  Well , you know , the The way they 're listening to it is they they get a they get  It 's linearized .  So if you picture what we have on the screen ,  um , you know , there 's this block and it goes over  I 'm doing it from my perspective .  You have this block  and it goes over to here and stops  and this person starts to talk  and he goes over to here  and then you have an overlap over here .  And so what they would get is this block from the first guy ,  this block from the second guy ,  and then the top of the overlap  and then the second guy in the overlap .  And then it would move on .  So it 's sort of like this you know , you go this way as much as you can ,  then you cycle through there  and then you go up to this next level  and  Um ,  let 's see ,  they hear them  Oh !  uh , they hear them separately in two chunks ,  but then sometimes they get confused about who the foreground speaker is , because they 're not being told who the foreground speaker is .  You know ,  and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that .  But with nine speakers  So what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there 's something that they think that the f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there .  And so they 'll get  And it 's numbered so that we end up with the same number of of transcribed slots .  Exactly .  Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed ,  and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together  because when it comes back to our end , um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've uh , partitioned according to the tape that they were given .  Cuz they don't they actually don't have digital interface either  so it 's it 's audiotape .  And they type it on  and then then it comes back to us  and Adam and Thilo have a program wa they put it back together into our interface format  and then we can use it .  But ,  um ,  um , there are f cases where you 'll get a segment and it 's someone else 's utterance  and that 's because that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two ,  and you 'll have like two totally parallel r renditions of the same thing .  Because i it 's just i n  So what they get is like i t is they get something like "" beep one "" .  And then then they get "" beep two "" , "" beep three "" .  Chuck Wooters does the numbers .  And , um , it cycles through .  No .  And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together .  Yes ,  exactly .  Yeah , that 's quite right .  And that 's why .  Exactly right .  Yeah .

Btr001.F,"They 're very fast .  Is l  Yeah .  Yeah .  It it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used ,  and we don't know exactly how they do it  and I think that that 's by intention , that @ @ not just me who thinks that it 's that proprietarily , it 's a very competitive business  and they probably don't wanna , uh , say too much about it .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But they 're very fast .  It 's uh  Yeah .  Huh .  Excellent .  Uh - huh .  You miss  Oh ! I see .  Oh , interesting .  Oh , how interesting .  Yeah .  Yeah ,  OK .  Yeah .

Yeah , that 's right .  Well , i it 's a judgment call .  And you can also say well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , "" Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them .

Have you noticed that Tiger  I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses "" cough "" a lot where it isn't really a cough .  You notice that ?  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Do you find  you 've  i This has caused me to wonder .  So , in Tigerfish ones , do you find that where they 've where they have like "" dot dot 's "" cuz it 's segments they didn't hear , that that you add u  you probably do add things in those places where it 's where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it .  Yeah .  Interesting .  Oh , interesting .  Huh .  Yeah .  It just occurred to me ,  this is a a different kind of question ,  but I w  from having listened to all these people ,  I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're they 're talking into your ear , really .  You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances .  Um ,  I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do .  And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are  and , "" Oh , you were so funny in that meeting ""  and it it has this sort of unusual dynamic  because , you know , I I 'm privy to information which really by all rights I shouldn't be ,  except of course they they agreed ,  they signed ,  they were there ,  they agreed .  But but it but it 's sort of an unusual relationship to say ,  you know , i i you know ,  if you 're in the meeting yourself , then you of course you 'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about , you know , whether they 're funny or not funny or whatever ,  but it  Oh , that 'd be interesting .  Yes .  He 's he 's on campus ,  I found this out .  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .  Yeah .  Nice guy .  Nice guy .  Oh , but he is .  I went on I actually went on a hike with him two weeks three weeks ago .  Yeah .  Yeah yeah . Yeah .  Nice guy .  Oh , she 's here .  Yeah , I 'm sure you 've seen her ,  uh but  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah yeah , that 's no problem .  I also find that some of the  you know , if someone sits there and and  it th there 's this o one who doesn't say much ,  but she just is always pleasant .  You know ,  and it 's kind of a smiling voice and she laughs  and  What a difference .  Yeah .  I mean it 's like  Actually it 's  um , she 's she 's just so pleasant .  And and , you know , adds a lot just by virtue of that .  You know , can People will talk on all these technical things  but she 'll she 'll say something technical and then laugh ,  and  It 's it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these these little things .  Mm - hmm .  I agree with you .  I agree ,  it 's it 's really interesting , Also ,  i it 's a persona ,  you get this  there 's definitely a sense of persona .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's right .  Yeah , it 's difficult .  Yes .  um , it 's mainly a matter of two things .  First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone ,  that it would be worthwhile doing .  And that 's the other thing , that we don't have  someone currently doing the video thing .  It would really be interesting .  Yeah .  That was Liz 's idea .  Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to give feedback .  Yeah .  Exactly .  Yeah .  ",,

I mean ,  if you  so it 's like , "" ha - ha - ha  uh "" .  I mean  Do you Have you run across this ?  And it 's like , to me I I think I 've heard comedians do that .  There 's some there 's something there about  you know , you you make a joke  and then you have an "" uh "" in there somehow ,  which I don't really understand the function of .  Do you  It 's possible ,  now what I 'm thinking  I didn't have the extra the extra e um , what do you say , nuances in the "" uh "" , which you just which you just did .  However , the context fits .  I mean , that 's an interesting take on it . I think  It 's possible .  It 's possible .  It 's just a normal "" uh "" .  Mm - hmm .  But it 's stuck in  maybe it 's a little louder than usual .  It 's not any of the extra , um , you know , glottal thing .  Well ,  but it just seems like it 's more prominent than  You know it really is like a placeholder of some sort ,  like  which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker ,  but  Yeah , that 's possible .  OK .  Oh . It could be .  Yes , po that 's possible .  It 's possible .  Exactly who I was thinking of actually .  Uh - huh .  Yeah . Exactly .  Yeah .  That 's true ,  that would The  And he does continue after that .  But it 's just you know , to say "" uh "" you kn to say "" uh "" while you 're laughing i it 's just to me it 's an interesting category .  That 's possible .  Very interesting .  Interesting .  Yes .  Yeah ,  that 's that 's  Huh , OK .  Oh n  Yes .  Yes .  He 's very funny .  He 's very funny .  I I started laughing with something he said the other day ,  it was it was the beginning of a meeting  and it hadn't gotten far into it  and  and he 's he 's doing this one of these mock fights with Nancy ,  which he does .  Have you run across these mock fights ?  And he s he says , um , something like ,  uh ,  I i and he 's m e they they have this nice @ @ mutual condescending joking thing going on ,  and he says , "" Well , I could explain this to you .  I have a better laugh than you do .  The transcribers told me so . ""  And it went on a little longer  but it 's li it 's like this really  Yeah ,  ",,
Btr001.F,"and then at one point she you know , at another meeting , she she was not sure which channel she was on ,  and he said , "" Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so ""  and then she said , "" Well , no ,  sh shouldn't it be channel so - and - so ?

They have this really nice  You know , it 's really  Those sorts of things , i it 's true ,  you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh , the nice interrelationships .  I think  I I found that 's a nice aspect of a lot of these meetings ,  the eh the , uh , eh little periods of humor like that .  Alright ,  well , so do we would would we could do digits if we so desired .  If w if we wanted to do that .  Let 's do simultaneous digits .  No , you don't ?  OK , the idea is that you have then , um , you have ground truth ,  you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said ,  and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all ,  so that we 're sure ,  as you 've done .  Yeah .  And you did also ?  No ,  because it 's it 's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface .  I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , you know , leave it ,  that 's fine .  Yeah .  Sometimes they don't .  Well , if you do that 's that 's alright as well .  You don't have to .  Because , uh , we 're we have the assumption that we 'll take care of it this in this other way ,  but In any case , the idea is that you have ground truth ,  you know exactly what the person should have said  and you check to be sure ,  and usually there aren't many errors eh w when they were checked .  Um , and then , you have this multiplicity of voices , uh , reading these things ,  and you can do really good speech recognition that way .  So they have some papers out that they 've done this .  It 's really it 's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses .  It 's nice to have , you know , a standard  Uh , you know , it 's like , uh , psychological approach also that you like to have some standard stimulus here  and then you can  Yeah .  I I agree ,  I think it 's a nice it 's a nice design feature .  Yes , you run across that .  Let 's see ,  I guess it would be  it 's up there .  Uh - huh .  Up there at the top .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yes .  Used to be .  Used to be .  This they changed them .  Initially it was words all spelled out ,  so "" ONE ""  Yes .  And that was like a Stroop test in some ways .  It took a lot of conc  When I was doing those I had to really concentrate .  It was like s "" One , s seven ""  you know , it was like You really had to "" let 's see , the words and the numbers ""  and  and then you 'd have an "" OH "" periodically  and , um , they were initially spelled out that way ,  one or the other .  But we converted them to this format ,  and then the idea  I mean , you could conceivably put an "" OH "" or a "" zero "" for the "" O 's "" and still have this benefit ,  but I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those those locations ,  and you know , maybe there 'd be  Yes ,  mm - hmm .  So , um  Sure .  Yes .  Well , see er also , this has been a a change in the procedure that used to be that they were like uh one long string  different sized strings .  But to have them broken up like this , it 's it 's m been about uh maybe half a year that that this or maybe maybe seven months , I don't know , maybe longer , that they 've gotten actually broken up within the line .  So the idea is @ @ to pause when you see that .  No .  That 's right ,  break it up more finely .  Well  I would say don't worry about that ,  because , um , this is w  again you know , it it 'd be nice to get the words right ,  but , um ,  the uh , the interface that these guys used , uh , allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately ,  so it 's not so important .  It 's more important to focus on the words ,  because there we don't know the ground truth .  So .  OK , so  Well , I don't know ,  how do you feel ?  I mean ,  what we could do is we could do it together one week  ",,
Btr001.F,"and then separate the next  or something like that  to give the variety .  We  why don't we do them together this time  just because in the interest of time , to get you out in time .

A lot of times , though , the breaths are , um , results of bad segmentation ,  and there 's a segmentation of nothing ,  and so they just write it as a breath when it 's clearly not a breath .  And I usually always take those out .  I mean , usually , um , it seems like the segmenter , um , often just sort of , um , segments  when there 's really long spaces , it segments random spaces in between .  And th you know , they get that  and there 's nothing there ,  so they m s mark it as a breath when it 's really actually nothing .  So usually I take those out .  Right . Right . Exactly , exactly .  Exactly .  Mm - hmm .  Oh really ?  Oh , I always get I always get "" breath "" .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm !  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Right .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  I think , um , silences are generally like not good in conversation too .  Cuz once you get a sil  You know , it it it 's to your benefit to to try to get in right when you think they 're done  because if there 's a silence , not only is it awkward , but then that sort of cues everybody to start thinking of a new topic to stop the silence ,  and then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about because the whole subject has changed .  You know ?  S  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  That 's what I usually do too .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah . I put in the "" X ""s .

You 've ruined the whole meeting !  We can't transcribe any of it now !  OK . Right .  Hmm  Yeah .  Oh , you have ?  I 've never heard the swearword versions .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  Then again , I always think that it 's closer to stick with the "" X  because it 's , like , how effective is , you know , the Roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make .  You know , it 's not the IPA  and it 's just , I I just sort of think , um , it 's best to leave it with "" X  because I y English orthography conventions are just so , you know , uncertain anyway in the first place ,  and , um  you know , I I usually only use them when I I know that , um , the person was trying to make a word .  I mean , I know that the the word they were trying to say  and that they were stuttering that ,  then I feel fine just you know , writing out the letters .  But otherwise , I sort of don't feel right trying to write them out  because I feel like it 's , um  you can't really  Yeah , you can't really spell those things with the R with the Roman alphabet ,  you know ?

That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up ,  because , uh , you know , every language has different , um , intonation mappings .  And  Right .

I mean , that 's why they use , like , I think  who was telling me ?  Ian Maddieson was talking about this , that they use male voices in , um , in , um , airports .  Because the acoustics of it it just fits into the hea a hearer 's range  Yeah , that 's th It fits into a hearer 's range of perception , um , better than a lot of female voices .  And so that 's why they use male voices .  We were just talking about that .  d Yeah , depending on their auditory , um , capabilities .  I mean , if their auditory capabilities , uh , have been , you know , um , squished down like in a certain place where it would be n easier for a person with normal , um , hearing to hear a male 's voice ,  um , like if I 'm saying if if they d if they had a some sort of , um , you know , damage to part of their brain that processes auditory information , then  and , i uh , e i u  if that part of the brain normally codes for , you know , male voices , uh , in a normal hearer , then they might not be able to .

I was just saying that it , like , you know , sometimes , um , if Remember I was saying , like , if there 's a discrepancy between fricatives , you know , like , um , "" shuh "" or "" suh "" will show up in a certain part of the spectrum ,  and and , uh , oftentimes the "" fuh "" is like knocked out of the spectrum by  ",,

Btr002.C,"um , because he would just always be clicking .  Mmm .  Oh , OK .  Yeah , this guy does a lot of single ones .

Right .  Mm - hmm .  A lot of people go ,  Right .  Right .  I guess I try to be more careful in my speech , more often .  Unless I 'm really not paying any attention  like , you know , if I 'm at a party or something , and I 'm just sort of having a good time , then it doesn't really matter ,  but in n you know , normal one - on - one speech I I think I tend to try to enunciate more .  Cuz I 've been told I mumble .  Um , and I guess I used to be worse about it .  I was told by my parents that I used to mumble a lot .  Uh , and also I I have this sort of East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I 'm saying .  A lot of times like , uh , if I 'm not paying attention I 'll say something that , uh , will not really be heard .  I tend to leave off final consonants , for instance ,  and people , uh , n I have to be conscious of that sometimes .  Yeah , so .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah . I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that 's n unnatural and forced .  Or something like a meeting where , you know , I mean everybody says their little schpiel  and people are meant to be , you know , pretty pretty quiet and attentive for the most part .  And then they let them finish ,  and then somebody else comes in  and says something about it .  Um ,  and in a n like a friendly conversation I I notice that that 's not really true .  Like what you were saying .  Huh !  That 's interesting .  No , not at all .  Kind of makes sense  because if you 're if you wanna speak next , it 's almost like you got y you gotta get your foot in the door .  You gotta be the one who you know , make sure people recognize that you 're the one who 's gonna speak next .  Oh , I see .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  Right .  OK .  Oh , OK . OK .  I 'm glad you ment brought that up  because I actually  I 'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little itsy bitsy tiny sounds in the middle of everything ,  because I was  because  Yeah . Cuz I was thinking , like , you 're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible .  And so , I 'm glad you said that  because , um , that actually takes a good amount of time , and like pretty strict concentration to d to do that .  Um ,  and so  I do that if it 's unintelligible ,  but if I can tell something if somebody goes "" r "" I 'll put an "" R "" .  Eh Um , so if they go "" r e m m "" , I 'll go "" R "" "" EH "" "" mmm "" m "" M "" "" M "" .  So like I I 've been doing that  because like that 's what I can hear .  And I 'm pretty damn sure that  sorry . Sorry !  Sorry . Hhh !  Sorry !  I 'm sorry .  I feel really bad now .  Oh no !  I 'm sorry !  OK  Oh no , I 'm so sorry .

Or , like  Yeah .  But it would play it backwards too .  But just to move back , but not necessarily a whole timebin ?  Yeah .  Or otherwise , drag it , or like click on it .  Yeah .  I think that would be useful .  Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues .  Much better now that I have the keyboard st tray ,  but it was  I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time .  And that I would it would crack a lot .  It was very weird .  But .  Uh - huh .  Oh . I see what you 're saying .  Well , I would press "" tab ""  and listen to where I wanted it to stop ,  and then press "" return "" , create a new timebin ,  and then "" shift ""  "" shift "" , what is it ?  "" Shift "" , "" backspace "" to c collapse it , yeah .  ",,
Btr002.D,"Oh . Do you drag do you drag the line ?  See , I never I never do that for some reason .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Um , one thing that 's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the "" shift - backspace "" as the collapser .  Because I 'll tend to delete things ,  or go too far , or something ,  or I 'll be holding down "" shift "" because I wanna type something as a capital ,  and then end up collapsing the timebins .  So , it might be better to use a different keys or something .  Yeah . Yeah !  Or just , I mean  but , or just to change the keys used , you know , for for that option .  I 'm used to it too ,  but , I mean  I don't think I 'm that bad ,  but  Yeah , I do that too .  Yeah .  It 's just th right above the backspace .  Yeah .  I think so .  Did it  Right .  I 'm actually used to  I 'm used to the SUN one , I guess , now .  Amaretto has a different one .  Linguine is Basmati have the same .  Right ?  Ooh !  Yeah .  But just the beginning .  Which is the  The PC one is the Amaretto one ,  right ?  I prefer th I prefer the one on Linguine or Basmati .  I don't know what it 's called .  Oh .  Yeah .  In the c  Yeah , the one in the  Yeah .  I I I could get used to I could get used to it too .  I just am very used to  I don't know .  Cuz I always use it .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I I remember recognizing certain numbers .  I don mmm , I don't remember which ones ,  but I think it was maybe  well , I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason .  It was like , a little bit of energy , or some whatever you call it ,  and then it grew really big .  So like "" four "" and "" five "" and "" three "" all had this same characteristic ,  and "" six "" and "" seven "" o both had the same characteristics to their in the beginnings .  But "" six "" and "" eight "" ?  "" Eight "" , um , I remember tended that people tended to not pronounce the last "" T "" .  And when they did , it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected .  Same with "" six "" .  The "" X "" , well the "" KS "" or whatever , at the end .  But  Yeah .  That was a that was really interesting to notice that .  Uh ,  It 's a very different interface , though .  I mean , it seems very strange .  Yeah .  Yeah , I only did it a little bit , too .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  If I remember correctly , it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things .  I can't remember what they were , now ,  but I just remember that it was once you learned them , it was very neat and concise  and , th like  couple keys that you used .  Hmm ?  Oh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  I feel like I did a little checking or something on that .  Yeah . I don't know I don't remember actually transcribing it ,  but I remember listening to  Yeah .  Right .  Yeah .  One thing that I still can't figure out with the interface ,  it does this sometimes  but other times it doesn't ,  is when you click on  you know , there 's a bar above where this sound wave is , that has , um , n the  it has a little bar of where the meeting is ,  like in  and it goes along as you 're listening to the meeting  and then it ends up the end .  And if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker then it moves forward ,  if you click on the left it moves back .  But sometimes it moves two frames or two screens ,  and sometimes it doesn't .  Really ?  OK .  Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it it would move twice  and then in n sometimes i it wouldn't ,  and maybe i maybe I had resolution set differently  or I s  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Yeah . That 's what I tend to do , is I use a soundwave ,  but if I 'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence sometimes I 'll s ry and be sc try to scan it ,  but I can't  because  it skips . Yeah .  So then I end up clicking on the arrow , they have the arrow at the far right ,  and so I use that sometimes .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something ,  I don't know .  Not second by second ,  but little bit by bit , yeah .  Um , it 's not on the resolution part .  It 's where you have it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting .  ",,
Btr002.D,"So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that moves along .  Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line .  I think  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's  Yeah .  Exactly .  So right at the right and left of that  Yeah .  Yeah !  Yeah . Yeah .  Exactly .  Maybe we have resolution set totally different .  Cuz I noticed when Jen and I have totally different resolutions ,  cuz hers moves so much quicker than mine ,  which means it 's more stretched out , right ?  Yeah . I usually have it set to where it has , um , point five second intervals on the numbers .  Yeah .  Yeah . I  I do too ,  but sometimes if it gets too too for me too stretched out , um , I 'll tend to think that there 's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something .  I don't know .  Yeah .  So I prefer it to be a little bit tighter ,  but I 'll stretch I 'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to , or something .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's kind of interesting , though .  Well if there 's any left we can grab it .  Ooh , those were good .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  And also that we can I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of ,  and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever ,  or  You know ?  Yeah . Yeah . I mean , i it 's really cool .  Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface .  I don't know .  Yeah , in the very beginning .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related ,  cuz it 's more interesting for me .  Yeah .  Exactly . And it 's f really hard t t  Yeah .  Yeah .  I  Yeah .  Yeah . You guys do some in the mee in the Meeting Recorder ones , there 's some talk of ,  D d I don't know ,  discourse stuff .  I think it 's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription .  Yeah . Cuz there are always people like , you know , talking bad about the transcribers ,  and just making fun of u  And so it 's really funny ,  I don't know .  It 's really funny to listen to .  You haven't ?  It 's really funny .  Yeah .  No !  Wow .  Yeah .  I think it 's funny when there 's little side conversations like that , that happen at the same time too .  I think those are interesting .  And I think it 's really cool when people  start getting really excited about something or angry about something  because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot ,  and  I don't know .  I mean , I remember one where one person , um , was really trying to get something out , really , really desperately ,  and he kept getting interrupted by like three p three other people ,  and he was like , "" I I I I I I I I I ""  And it was I mean it was kind of sad  but it was , like , also really interesting to watch ,  or to listen to .  Both .  Yeah .  They 're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something ,  falls apart . I don't know .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yep .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yes .  I know .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  You know , I  sorry , to I just remembered one thing that really was you needed  I think it was you that pointed out the problem .  Like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly , the noise .  I think it was Adam was making this really strange noise ,  and apparently he was pretending  he was like pretending to r screw something into his head ?  Was that what it was ?  Yeah ! Y yeah !  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm .  Oh .  Oh wow .  y I had one like that where they were describing the different f qualities of "" uh - huh "" and "" uh "" and "" uah ""  and like what "" EH "" is versus "" UH "" versus "" AH "" .  That was really hard .  Yeah .  That 's really interesting .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I don't have to be anywhere until five ,  so .  Good .  Oh man .  Oh n  That 's really funny .  Right .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  It takes a long time , yeah .  Yeah .  I tends I you know what I noticed , is it tends to have a still , a dominant group of speakers  and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all  except to say their digits or something ,  or who  or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever .  Yeah .  Yeah . But I I think that still overall you 're gonna have probably three or four or five dominant speakers .  Yeah .  Exactly .  Yeah .  So you 've this is like the tenth time for you , then .  Yeah .  Oh , OK .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , man .  Yeah ! Yeah .  Occasionally .  Like on the bus or something when I 'm bored .  Oh , really ?  ",,
Btr002.D,"Oh , OK .  Oh , that 's funny .  Yeah .  Huh , that 's interesting .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah . I noticed a lot of my speech i I don't know , I wouldn't call them errors , I guess disfluencies , a lot more once when I started transcribing .  I just noticed and in ge people in general , that people break up their speech interestingly .  Yeah !  Actually .  I think that shows a lot of I think that shows a lot of how , um , it 's not all acoustic .  I mean , there 's other things involved ,  eye contact ,  body language ,  gesture ,  whatever .  Yeah .  I definitely think so .  And I think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on , personally .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And you can really get a feel for the re interpersonal relationships ,  which kind of comes into play , maybe not for speech recognition ,  but for other things , maybe ?  Maybe .  Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation ,  and other things like that .  Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe .  Oh .  Uh - huh .  That 's pretty amazing .  Enhanced other senses , I guess .  That 's really cool .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  That 's something you don't hear in normal speech too .  In normal conversations , unless it 's very dramatic or very loud ,  that people click their Their lips are always making funny noises  and  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  We - yeah , we filter all that out .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Which is a very it 's that 's how I tended before studying linguistics anyways and , uh , definitely before doing transcription , how I tended to look all conversations ,  and then coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way .  Um .  Including , I mean , every little aspect .  I and when I tell people what I do here ,  and tell them , "" Yeah , I 'm transcribing "" .  And they 're they think I 'm like a stenographer or something .  I 'm like , "" No , I don't correct the grammar .  I don't erase the "" um "" 's and "" uh "" 's ,  I record all the sighs , and the laughs , and the breaths ,  and "" And they 're  I don't know .  This is a very different thing than most people can relate to , I guess .  Or know about .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  And when you think about it , they pick up exactly where they left off ,  even though maybe it 's several seconds later , there 's no glitch in the syntax or anything .  It 's We 're pretty amazing machines .  Or creatures ,  whatever .  That 's really cool .  Yeah .  Mmm .  It 's like  "" tisk "" .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  It could be .  But I noticed it more as it was obviously not  because it was always in a g the one I 'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something .  And so it wasn't ever like a , um , single l  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .  That 's kind of the impression I got too .  No .  Hmm .  Yeah .  That 's more like the "" @ @ "" .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  It could be .  Yeah .  Yeah . Me too .  Oh yeah .  It 's like "" humph "" .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  I usually tend to think that it 's a more of a  Hhh . not indignation .  Something more positive .  I don't know exactly wha how to characterize it ,  but something more  Yeah .  "" Hmm . ""  Yeah .  Or  I i I don't know .  Maybe .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  That 's interesting .  I noticed , i m as far as problems with laughs , is that a lot of them were marked as breaths .  Because a lot of people ,  I think we already talked about this last time ,  but  but not so much as , I never saw that written out phonetically , or whatever .  Yeah , that 's what I used to do too .  So you would have like "" lef laugh , breath , laugh ""  transcribed ?  Oh , I 've  Yeah .  OK .  I see what you 're saying .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Sometimes it 's hard to tell .  Yeah .  Yeah . Exactly .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah . I 've taken out some of those .  Yeah .  Oh , yeah . I 'm sure they are .  Although , they did put a "" missing segment "" so sometimes in brackets .  I 've gotten both .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah . I 've seen a few of them ,  but I 've seen a several "" breath "" 's too .  Yeah ! Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's just in the wrong place .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Really ?  Uh - huh .  Hmm . One thing that I noticed  I don't know if it 's a really a question of me being more c changing my speech necessarily ,  but I 'm much more aware of interruptions in conversation in normal conversation .  So , uh , maybe I am more careful in the sense that I maybe don't interrupt as much ,  ",,
Btr002.D,"or j I 'm more aware of it when I am doing it ,  or something like that ,  but , um , I just pay attention more to the fact that every pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions .  There 's no  I mean , unless you have really aw  I mean , I think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward .  There would be a lot of pauses ,  and that would kind of i imply uncomfortability , or something .  But ,  yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's different .  Yeah .  Yeah .  But even in cases like that , even when it is  see now I 'm contradicting myself ,  but even when it is very turn - taking is very w like people follow the turn - taking rules , or whatever , and don't really blatantly interrupt people ,  um ,  and I I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions ,  or e not enough overlaps , or something .  It wasn't interruptions  it was overlaps , that I was thinking about .  Not enough overlaps .  And so she wanted to there to be an argument or something so that there 'd d be more .  And ch what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then there had been ,  they were just very small ,  but they were there .  I think they 're there pretty much a all the time .  Uh - huh .  Oh !  Yeah !  Yeah !  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And then everybody talks at once .  You know , thinking about it ,  I I think I 've only noticed a couple times where there 's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time .  It 's only been like twice .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Then  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah , seriously .  Do you remember what you were gonna say ?  Yeah .  Uh - huh .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Oh !  Oh !  Yeah .  Yeah .  Initials ?  I I also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials .  Yeah .  Yeah .  OK .  OK .  OK .  Can I ask one more thing about these comments .  So we are for  "" QUAL "" is used for things like "" whispered "" , or "" said while laughing "" , or things of that nature .  Um , I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non - vocal sounds ?  Oh !  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Very efficient .  OK . But for , like , noise that we know is something like mike noise , or something like a door , whatever , then we can mark it as that  and no  Yeah , right .  Or  o or if it 's  Right .  OK .  So we do need to add that one ?  OK . Sure . OK .  Yeah , that 's fine .  That 's what we did last time .  Yeah .  Hmm .  ",,
Btr002.E,"OK . So , everything 's  Oh , the microphone adjustments , we should check  Would you check the microphone adjustments , please ?  Is is M So , is is Marisa 's close enough ?  We could we look  But , I mean , also , to get the do you you what you said about  is i is it close ?  OK . Alright .  But this w You know , he 's , like , the expert ,  and I don't know exactly , uh  Yeah .  It 's interesting .  Hello ?  Yeah .  Your voice is so is so i it 's like , s you can see across all the channels when you talk .  It 's great .  Thanks very much . Thanks very much .  Alright .  So . Uh , welcome back .  Thank you for coming .  Um , so , what I thought we 'd do today is pick up where we were last time  and maybe , uh , go over some some ideas about , um ,  well , i the return to the conventions ,  but I also wanted to , uh , share with you a couple of the things that I 've picked up in terms of checking .  And these are uh , th these are things that came up with the tra with the Tigerfish transcripts .  I 'm just doing this cuz I think it 's interesting .  OK . So , um , I have an example  which  um , so there 're a couple of examples .  I have one in front of you which is the one where ,  um , um , u  Leah Leah noticed this one where I said something and , um , the transcriber interpreted it as "" twosome gruesome , uh , different sizes different this "" ,  and , um , actually what I meant to say was um , "" so you 're saying groups of different sizes ,  different size groups ? ""  Yeah .  I I  It 's really enormously far away .  Now this this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad .  Maybe very very soft .  Maybe with the microphone noise ,  or something from someone else ,  or an overlap ,  or  but they 're not usually that bad , I I don't think .  Then , um , I have a couple of others .  So , there 's one , um  So , the person said , "" interesting idea "" ,  but Tigerfish thought it was , "" uh , just an idea "" .  Now that changes the meaning .  It 's interesting .  And then there are various ones like , um , um , "" ish decay "" instead of "" HTK "" .  And now this one  "" Ish decay "" .  Now "" ish "" was in parentheses  Well they they they were suspicious that wasn't right ,  but that was the closest they could come .  And , you know , with when you 're dealing with acronyms ,  that 's that 's that shows one of the problems with acronyms .  Is that it 's clear if you know it ,  but  Always conceivable .  I don't remember off hand .  I did check the example .  And , um ,  well , and this this would be consistent .  So , uh , it was transcribed as "" with H "" ,  but it was really "" with age "" .  Yeah .  And , uh , then there are some where actually punctuation changes the meaning .  So , this is the these are things that Barbara show uh , found .  "" Spurts wouldn't be right "" was what it looked like .  But , actually when you listen to it , it would be "" Spurts wouldn't be . Right ? ""  A  It is subtle .  And yet , you know , it 's like And instead of instead of "" and it 's "" they put "" Annette 's "" .  Now this this is interesting  because it 's like , you know , we know that there 's no Annette on any of the meetings we 've ever dealt with ,  but , um , it 's , you know , conceivable .  And then ,  um ,  let 's see .  There 's one other here I thought was interesting .  Well this was  OK , so it should have been "" the quals w the the quals slides will be fine "" .  This is Jerry Feldman .  And , uh , instead it was transcribed with "" the "" and then an uncertain syllable "" the the "" and then "" all the slides will be fine "" .  Which is interesting .  And and , you know , this was a case where the timebin was off .  I wanted to bring an example where th  So "" all the slides "" it 's w started too late .  It 's another case of devoicing at the initial  Yeah .  So , I thought that was very interesting .  And I think that it shows , um these sorts of things , I was thinking it would be interesting to do an analysis of these things  because I think that ,  um ,  if well first of all , there 's this overall point that it shows a degree to which , when you listen to speech , and when you 're just , in general , listening , probably ,  but it shows espec specifically this to this task , that it 's very constructive .  You 're not going on simply the auditory there 's a huge contribution from the top - down processing ,  and the you know , e different types .  You 've got the contextual information ,  you have syntax ,  you have your mastery of English , and these various things .  ",,
Btr002.E,"But I think these kinds of errors , it just shows the degree which it 's not strictly an acoustic task .  And the other thing I think that 's interesting is , the types of the types of confusions that happen , um , do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus .  So , the stress tends to be preserved ,  you know , the content word will be substituted for another content word ,  and , um ,  It 's it 's not surprising that they would hear this .  I 'm o I 'm often surprised by how how plausible something can be with without it being correct .  Because it really seems like it 's  And then often , you know , i it 's , um , i there 's ex the parentheses are used ,  so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match .  But , uh .  OK . Now having said that I 'm I 'm impressed by h how by how , um well , how infrequent these these kinds of extreme cases are .  Most of the types of things that I find in checking are much much more mild .  Yeah . So so .  Do you wanna  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  In a way  So , uh , let me be sure I understand .  So , you 're saying s  boy , it 's hard to ig uh , ignoi that ignore that word .  Um ,  So y the example is , "" That would be hard ""  "" That 'd be a problem , ""  "" so . ""  And how does it change the meaning ?  What 's what are the two different meanings there ?  OK .  Oh , I see what you 're saying !  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  It 's it 's interesting that there are so many cases .  And I agree .  I th I think those are very good conventions .  I also like w you know , this this whole point about how how that y th th the fact that you 're raising this ,  I li I like this example that , um , we have several things that are being cued by intonation ,  because if if that 's a f nice full falling intonational contour on "" that 's a problem "" ,  "" eh , that 'll be a problem "" .  then I would think that there should be a period there .  And then especially if you 've got a pause following it ,  but you don't always y  these things are correlated but they 're not perfect .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  You mean non - native na Non - native speakers ?  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .  Absolutely . Yeah , absolutely .  Ideally , wouldn't that be something .  I ideally it would be nice to have like a Spaniard t tran transcribing the  Oh , is that what you mean ?  Or  That 'd be nice .  I agree .  Mm - hmm .  I I OK - So , in terms of like when you 're going through the Tigerfish transcripts , you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases ?  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Good . Good to hear .  Mm - hmm .  Good .  It 's Could be .  Well , you know , there 's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation ,  cuz  Yeah .  OK .  Yeah , when I 'm clearing the par parentheses , I find that very useful .  I I sometimes I try to just go through and pick up the parentheses ,  see if I can do it just by itself ,  but it it 's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque ,  and then you go back to , you know , the person 's previous utterance  or you go to the mixed channel ,  or you , uh , check on the other things  and suddenly it becomes perfectly clear .  It 's very very surprising .  Very surprising .  Good .  Yes .  Yeah , it 's really a an odd task in in a way  because they 're they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they 're transcribing .  And the pre - segmenter doesn't give them any or the information eith either .  I 'm I 'm sure that it 's because of the  Yeah .  Yes .  That would make that would make some sense .  OK .  Oh !  I see .  So  Huh .  So so this means that people with hearing problems would hear , uh , uh , one of these announcements better if it were a male voice then .  Uh - huh .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Selective .  Is better ?  Ah , it 's a wider band then .  Because of  do you think it might be from the  She asked this question last time which was , um , whether our system here , the recording system , may have some of the same channel restr some sort of s channel restrictions , such as they ran across when they were looking at telephone , uh , transmissions at a certain point .  Cuz , you know , telephone transmissions , um , there 's some filtering going on .  You don't hear the full the full band of frequencies .  And , w uh v I asked c a couple of people and they c answer came back that  It was intere an interesting  it 's reminded me because of the comment about noise ,  noise being sp really spreading frequencies across , uh , using frequencies across a broader spectrum .  ",,
Btr002.E,"So in a way , bandwidth can increase with some of these cases of distortion that we have .  But it 's n it 's not a useful kind of increase in frequency range .  Answer ?  That they that they don't .  We don't have a reduction in that direction .  That , uh , I mean , you know , one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have ,  but we 've got good microphones  and another there is sort of an upper limit set on our bandwidth by the sampling rate  but then that becomes  So Adam 's ans that  then it becomes a matter of , Is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range .  And , I didn't really have the sense that it would .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Good . I I that was my impression also .  It wa so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones .  And actually in the work that they were doing with the telephone corpora , they did run into limitations  and uh , certain types that they when what their speech recognition approach  is because of the of the filtering .  I mean it does seem like when I hear these things , except for the distortion parts ,  where the volume 's too high , or th of course when the volume 's too low ,  but that 's a different problem ,  um , except for those cases , it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear .  I don't feel that it 's being reduced in any way .  Yeah ?  And he was saying in the in the , uh , areas where you have clipping , where it 's recorded too high , and and it starts to saturate and you have trouble ,  um I thought that was very interesting .  So bandwidth then gets gets actually wider instead of narrower  because you have ,  um  Uh - oh .  You have these y y you still have The frequencies are represented  but the energy distributions are thrown off ,  and , um , in fact you have also some additional frequencies .  So you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally ,  I mean  But not helpful for speech .  No , technically , the bandwidth is wider than  so it 's actually paradoxical in a way  cuz you usually think bandwidth better bandwidth is better .  But in the cases of of distortion than you can end up with ,  uh ,  a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech .  So .  Yes .  Yes .  One source was , there was a problem with a connection  where the microphone went int went into a box  I was trying trying to think of this as prior to  yes , it was prior to the wireless .  There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless ,  which was , um , mechanically bad in some some sense ,  and if it got touched , it would s it would send an impulse ,  i in al an uh an irrelevant non - wanted artifact .  I agree . Absolutely painful .  Exa - I agree .  And that 's that 's th you know , I would watch the visual sis signal to avoid that .  It 's like  Yeah .  Oh !  Yeah . That 's really awful .  You 've noticed that those have gotten better over the intervening ?  Good .  Oh .  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .  I think so too .  Yeah , I  when I realized  yeah , when I realized , I I meant to tell everyone to watch that visual signal  cuz that 's that 's saved me a bunch of times .  Yeah .  It might be useful to to talk about the interface for for a bit ,  in terms of what it is that you like particularly , and what you don't ,  and , uh , that kind of thing .  Ooh , interesting .  Mm - hmm .  Interesting .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Interesting idea .  I 'll I 'll s I 'll suggest that to the charer .  That 's it 's good to be careful about the mousing .  You were gonna say ?  Yeah .  How do you mean "" expand "" ?  What do you mean by "" expand "" ?  OK .  OK . OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  I vary .  I I should it depends on how much I wanna go back  and how certain the boundary is .  If I can see it if it 's if I can see this thing 's coming up and it 's just so clear ,  it 's that mountain right there , I can tell , then  yeah , dragging is really f efficient .  But if it 's like a mess in there , then it helps me to be able to locate it with the actual clicking .  And then do this what th you were just describing .  But , um  Oh that 's annoying !  This if I were to  if I were to add an option , it might be to have an undo for that .  Because I have had that happen .  Yeah , s Good .  Mmm .  Oh .  How do you get per I don't know the evil apostrophe .  Oh , oh !  I see .  OK . So this is the difference between the PC keyboard and the SUN keyboard ?  So , like I only have one I have one versus two of the others .  Is that right ?  So it 's  OK .  Mm - hmm .  There 's  Basmati ?  Amaretto ?  OK .  S so which t  I I 've forgotten which one is which .  ",,
Btr002.E,"So , which one do you prefer ?  Is it is it the So , if we had a show of hands , how many people would vote for the SUN keyboard versus the  So let 's put it the other way .  How many people would not vote for the SUN keyboard ?  Would vote for the other one ?  The PC PC keyboard ?  I don't know .  I don I 'm not sure .  It 's the  Uh - oh .  The Linguine is OK .  You 're multi - keyb  OK , let 's do it that way .  So so if we if we have a map of the room , the one when you first walk in  the one on the left is that Basmati ?  OK .  And  And then the f the far right corner as you walk in ?  Yep .  U u  Good .  OK .  And the one close to you is Basmati .  OK . So now , ha ha who would 've  So , if you have a strong  Now you 're bi - keyboardal  so ,  s but  but , um ,  who who would prefer the keyboard on Linguine ?  OK . We got two votes for Linguine .  And who would prefer Amaretto ?  Amaretto ?  So we got more more multi - keyboardal people ?  Well , that 's lovely .  Same here ?  Excellent .  OK , so i  OK .  I pr I see .  I I have experienced this keyboard conflict ,  and f with me the things that are confusing are th where the control key is ,  so I end up  pressing shifts and control keys whenever I want the other one , whiche whichever it is .  I could easily put a PC keyboard in there if anyone had  I we already have one ,  I could add ane another one  we so , w you know , maybe let me know if you want it to have it shifted .  But , um ,  OK .  That 's good .  Oh , let me see .  So , um , I I wanted to , um , m maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this ,  unique the shapes of some of these things are . I know we had this interface for a time when people were doing marking of the numbers ,  and , um , um ,  I 've forgotten Someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it . They could see the the waveform and "" Oh , it 's gonna be a seven . ""  Becau  Oh .  Mm - hmm . It is different .  Well , it w it would it had the benefit of it  So , this this was to handle the digits , uh , only ,  which is what you figure .  And , um , did you I thought you might have done that , Joel .  Did you also ?  So , two people did that , i um , I thought .  Did you do it ?  I thought so .  Good , good .  OK .  Well , I think that we 'll bring it back .  The th  Uh , Adam wrote this as uh , using the same , uh , computer language as Channeltrans is written in ,  and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said ,  and then you would listen to it ,  and everyth the j  there were two parts to the task ,  one of them was to see if that 's what they actually said ,  and to indicate , you know , in the i transcribe errors of it .  And then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins .  And those data were actually used in some analyses which showed uh , very very good results .  And so it shows ,  I mean it 's it 's useful .  This is this is why we do these digits .  It 's a nice standard task ,  and you have lots of different voices ,  and it 's very clear .  You know what the canani canonical answer is when a person says a number ,  um , at least most of the time , you know what number it was they said .  So its  "" ground truth "" , as they call it , is very clear .  So .  But i it was , um , really rather minimal .  I mean , I I like that interface .  Very efficient ,  and really is , um I th think that we 'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins .  Excellent .  Oh , that 's right !  That 's right .  I also think that wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed ,  so I don't think you could use a string search , right ?  I mean , I was trying to remember how that worked .  But it was difficult finding them for some reason .  Well , y it was also , like you  That 's a down side .  Mm - hmm .  Actually , you you also did a different type of transcription i uh , with res respect to , um , our sister project ,  the SmartKom project ,  which involved listening to people who were supposed to be wandering through Germany ,  and this is s supposed to be something that would be useful in developing an interface to help them find their way .  So , um someone else did that too ,  I 've forgotten who who else did that ?  Did anybody else here do that ?  OK .  Actually , I think you might have done this also , as I think about it .  Oh .  ",,
Btr002.E,"Mm - hmm . So actually we started with the words  and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the s with the actual sounds .  Cuz they were reading from a script .  And then there was some conversation in addition , that that , um , needed to be transcribed .  But , um ,  yeah .  One thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really , really , really long utterances , it 's extremely inefficient to do anything .  Because you end up p p p  if you try to n go up in the transcript , you end up with this huge huge space of time  and things covering several screens  and it 's just horribly i inefficient ,  so .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Oh yes .  Mm - hmm .  I 've noticed that .  I think that 's totally dependent w on how you have the resolution set .  So that little tiny thing .  And if I increase the resolution so it 's spread out a bit more , then I seem to have more control over it .  But , I don't have  Yes .  I 'm gonna report that to him ,  cuz I I 've I know  that 's one of the reasons why , when I uh suggested to visual scan the record , that I suggested doing it by clicking on the right of the of that navigation bar you 're mentioning .  Or , actually , clicking on the right of the sound wave and then letting it run past the boundary ,  because I had the same problem .  It 's  cuz you always know  Yes .  Yeah , much more  Mm - hmm .  Cuz you end up missing entire frames .  Ye - I was surprised by that .  Yeah .  Yes , OK . OK .  So , on the on that on that bar you were describing . Clicking  OK .  So , is this the arrow on the right ,  it would be underneath that little resolution bar ?  I mean , it 's like in that u cluster up there ?  Mm - hmm .  I have to do something visually .  So , my I would say you have the transcript screen ,  and then you have a bar .  I think you 're referring to this bar , aren't you ?  And then there 's like this little resolution changer .  And then down here you have the soundwave ,  and then something down here ,  and then you got the cha the different channels come out .  So r right in here you have this bar that you move and as y as you go along it  OK , so , is Are you saying  you saying that there 's an arrow right here ?  OK . And then there 's an arrow right here ?  OK .  So you can @ @  Oh . That 's interesting .  I haven't paid attention to the numbers .  I sort of like visually , i  it helps me to have it be separated enough that I could find a new breaking point if I needed it .  Expanded ?  Mm - hmm .  Well , we 're coming kind of close to the end of our time here .  Um , I did ask about dessert  and they told me it was ice cream  and it doesn't save well ,  so . I mean  That 's right .  Yeah , there 's some Those are those are nice .  But I did I was thinking i you know , it is interesting to me to think about how each each of us have sampled different meetings ,  and yet , i i it 's intriguing to me to think that if I were to describe someone 's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns , I bet you , we would all agree on who it who it was .  You know .  I think that 's so interesting .  Yeah , it 's it 's a statement of speaker style , of course ,  but .  Do you have any favorite parts of these meetings ?  Things that you  I mean , we di we talked briefly about this last time .  Is this do you think this is usually toward the end of the meeting ,  or does it vary ?  Cuz it could  The the person  OK .  Do you have a favorite group that you that you like ?  I don't I don't wanna cause any partisanship here ,  but  A a fav a favorite t type of meeting that you like ,  or , um or  It whichever .  I that way  or or a nature of a meeting ,  or  OK .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Those are th E - would these be the EDU meetings ?  That 's what I think .  Is that true ?  Oh , really ? OK .  Oh ,  I I 'm really ?  Oh , I 'm glad .  Oh , Johno does a lot of that .  It would be a kick Yeah , in a uh , in a good - natured way @ @ .  It would be really fun to have a collage of all these things , like , "" Well , the transcribers ""  so , "" Rer - rer - rer - rer ""  and then s be some horrible thing , "" The transcriber 's gonna have trouble with this . @ @ ""  Did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing , um , clicks like from African languages ?  Wasn't that a kick ?  That was really a kick .  Yeah .  Yep .  I was . Exactly .  Exactly so .  Exactly .  Exactly !  ",,
Btr002.E,"Have have you noticed that sometimes you have these a a g g greater frequency of speech errors , I think , during times of inter of overlap  which which is you can just tell a person 's m monitoring at two levels  and it 's it 's difficult .  Oh , thank you !  Thank you .  Yeah .  Let 's see . Have you noti th one of the things that I found is is , um , surprisingly difficult these days is to co is to get certain electronic sounds , to try and describe them .  Have I was thinking about that the other day ,  it was like it 's like ,  y y you know ,  someone in one of these EDU meetings , they have a laptop  and they hit the thing  and the and there 's an error screen that comes up  and it has this "" doink "" kind of sound .  And it  What is that ?  It 's not a beep .  It 's not a bell .  It 's not s it 's not a "" dong "" .  It 's not a  I mean , you there 're all these words that I could imagine  and so , it 's like , it 's a "" tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop "" .  And that 's that 's not really very helpful .  Oh . You mean the voice quality ?  The the shift in  Oh , that thing .  Oh th  Yeah . Well and then , you know , there are these other things that I think are really interesting ,  like the vocal changes in character .  People shifting into a kind of a comic voice ,  or sort of a mock - this or mock - that ,  you know , the sighing  and the , "" Oh no ! ""  You know , it 's it 's , uh , i There are lot 's of nuances which we uh , which we use very often .  Comic words and things like that .  And  Yeah ?  Yeah .  "" Eech - eech "" , or something .  "" Whee - whee "" .  s s  Yes . It was one of these it was this kind of deal .  Yes . Oh , yes .  And he got to transcribe this meeting .  And there was all this meta stuff about  Cuz I was giving a report on what the comments were ,  and it was one of these was this ,  s so  "" Whee - whee "" . is what he said .  And he was going like this at the time .  Yes , that 's right .  Let 's just  Oh man .  You did an excellen excellent job .  That was really it was like m transcription , a meta - transcription and meta meta meta .  It 's really @ @ .  You know , I 'm really interested in this topic .  Would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this ?  Or do you need to g do people need to leave .  I don't wanna keep you longer than  Are we OK ?  Oh , OK . We won't be that long , I don't think .  But but I really appreciate it .  This is just really i it 's so interesting to me , the the specific experiences of of having encountered these data in this way .  Does , um Did anybody else wanna say anything about  Yes .  Oh my gosh .  Well , it is There 's another case where I ran across like o of that type ,  um , i when I was sitting here and we were doing  This was like o one of the first meetings I ever participated in  and and Dan was adjusting something here  and Adam was in the next room ,  and , um , Adam says , "" So I 'll come in here and check the levels , ""  and and he says something  and Dan says , "" No "" .  And it sounds like he 's saying "" no "" to Adam ,  and it was w if if if so , this would have been extremely rude .  But - but the thing and and the reason that it would be rude is because you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels ,  you don't know that they 're not participating in the same conversation at all .  It really is strange .  I it lead us it ta if we w  It is true that this is kind of an artificial  and i um ,  discourse c aspect ,  the mixed channel is artificial  because we 're boosting it in order to make everything audible .  But  You mean when you leave here ?  When you 're somewhere else ?  No , no . OK .  How about these meetings when where there are like eight speakers i in one meeting .  Are those What are those like ?  Are  OK .  I had that same reaction .  Absolutely . And sometimes these are meetings I participated in .  It 's - it 's like  That 's righ that 's right .  Never changes .  I 'm gonna check out outside to make sure that we 're OK with the , um  Is it OK if we stay for another half hour in this room ?  Good , thanks .  That raises a question .  Um , do you think that , um , you would have been considerably helped if we had had video tapes of these things ?  OK .  Mmm , well , mm - hmm , mm - hmm that 's right ,  cuz you 're involved in gesture research .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm - hmm .  Oh , interesting .  Huh .  Mm - hmm .  That 's  ",,
Btr002.E,"I know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator .  I mean , there 's a there 's a blind man in this in this building ,  and and , um , Lila was in the elevator one day .  And they hadn't spoken yet  cuz he just came on the elevator  and he says  uh , and then she then she said something  and he says , "" Y you sp you 've changed your perfume . ""  Yeah , it 's pretty interesting . Pretty interesting .  Yes , she had .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  It 's very interesting .  Have you  I I 've learned several things about having been Wi - i with the close - talking mikes .  This is this is a new experience .  Cuz I have of course been involved in in this kind of thing for quite a while ,  but th there are several things I didn't realize you could hear so reliably ,  and some of these are the things like when the mouth opens  and the inbreath and stuff  and it and how extremely audible and and visual ,  I mean , you can see these the inbreaths and things .  It 's that was really surprising to me , that you it 's that tangible .  I guess it 's also one of these things that u usually is not meaningful ,  so we sort of screen it out .  u all these different in  cuz , you know , I mean , we do that all the time with all other well , lots of other aspects of the acoustic signal .  It sounds like it 's a nice smooth melody ,  but these things are voicing and unvoicing , are tripping in and out ,  and they don't The contour is really not nearly that neat .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . Absolutely .  That 's right .  That 's right .  Mm - hmm . The I agree .  Another thing that I think is interesting in these meetings is , certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances in other embed uh , in other utterances .  And , um , you know , it 's very clear when you see it when you hear it with the intonational markers ,  but well , just the contours ,  but the words on the page , it 's not at all clear .  And there are a couple people who do this in particular .  I I would say that it 's both I would say that both Jerry and Morgan do this .  And it 's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it ,  but how very complicated it is when you see the words .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So , and then of course there are these these things which I think are also nicely represented in the data  which are these funny sounds people make ,  which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk .  So , I notice people going , "" Pfft "" you know , if they 're trying to say something is done .  The Germans do this I think in particular .  And there are others that we use like that th  which are sort of semi - conventionalized ,  but you wouldn't think that you would write them down .  Oh yes ! Good example .  Yes .  This cou Is this the one that  I mean , it could be the one that we were thinking about .  Yes . Uh - huh .  It would be it would  Oh , how interesting .  I 'll ask you who this is later .  I don't wanna cuz  OK .  The the one that I 'm thinking of ,  i it 's a matter of you can tell it 's in context where he 's looking in his agenda to see , you know , "" Do I have time to do this ? ""  and he 's calculating it in his mind .  So it 's sort of li almost like a stand - in for calculator , kind of thing .  And i uh , but it 's signaling .  I 'm sure that everybody I 'm sure that other people can hear it .  So it 's sort of like , "" Wait a minute , I 'm thinking . ""  But it 's not lexicalized .  This is not a  i not in a standard way ,  it 's  OK . OK . OK .  He must do this in a lot of meetings  because I think you know , I 've run across it several times .  Yeah .  Heard that one .  Oh , I see .  Oh yes .  Yeah , OK . Now what I would say um ,  it 's good to know this .  C what I what I would say is , um , if it 's communicative s beyond just the p mouth opening and the w oh , you know , the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak , then I would like to have it if it 's communicative , I 'd like to have it preserved .  a But if it 's just this mechanical stuff , "" mouth "" is fine .  The It seems like the computer science people use "" lipsmack "" for that .  I Personally , my choice  eh , w we 've we 're still deciding on how we 're gonna encode it in the final version .  But I tend to not like "" lipsmack ""  because I think that that 's could be meaningful  and it 's a little confusing .  People talk about , you know , "" Oh gee , that was really good , ""  and then they do a  I 'm not gonna do it  ",,
Btr002.E,"cuz I don't really know how to do lipsmack .  But but it seems like it would be a a vocal gesture ,  a definite type of thing .  Yes .  Same here . Yeah .  I would too .  I would say "" tongue click "" for that .  But I would also probably put in parentheses it that I thought it was a vocal gesture .  Because I think it 's communicative of a certain thing .  Oh . Good point . Yes .  Really good point .  Yeah .  I would too .  I think it 's more emphatic .  Mm - hmm .  But it th it 's true that th segments are different too .  Well , now , y This is a good question .  I guess I would say th you know , sometimes we 've seen "" hmph "" in literature meaning in  but it 's a s a sigh a si uh , sorry . A sound of indignation .  So , if it 's meant as a sound of indignation then I think that would be how I would capture it , with the HMPH thing .  a sort of like a sup uh , an uh , an elevated "" hmm "" ?  It 's like a m sort of more surprise , or engagement ?  Mm - hmm .  And then there 's the other kind which sounds similar ,  but it 's really part of a laugh .  So , "" Hmm - hmm - hmm - hmm - hmm "" .  Which is I would just say "" laugh "" for that .  Good .  Well done . Well done .  I 've run across that also .  And  Right .  Change it to "" laugh "" .  Well done .  I ran across a couple "" ho "" 's occ  I 've seen "" ho "" 's  and  and "" heh "" .  Yeah .  Yeah , that 's right .  W we  Yes .  Yeah .  Well i  Yes .  Yes .  Yeah ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ?  Uh - huh . Yeah , yeah .  I agree with you .  That 's that 's what I prefer .  Good . Well done .  Well done .  Mm - hmm .  That 's good . That 's good .  That 's right .  That 's good .  That 's right .  And  I agree with you .  And and I think that 's important  because we 're capturing then the communicative level .  And it 's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well .  Because it 's sort of expulsive and and , uh , that kind of thing .  Ex - exactly . Exactly .  Well done .  Yes they do .  Yeah , the shyer ones sometimes will laugh i with the breath - laugh .  And you can see it .  You can see the little little peaks , which is interesting .  But yes . Yeah , exactly .  I wouldn't , uh i That 's a case whe you know , I know generally with the Tigerfish things that they put "" breath "" and we leave it in .  But absolutely there , yeah .  "" Laugh "" , change it .  And , you know , there are other places where it 's in the way , you know .  I I mainly said not to change their "" breath "" 's simply because it would take time to move them if  and if they 're not in the way then don't don't mess with it ,  but  Oh yes !  Great .  That 's right .  One wonders what it might be  Yeah .  Yeah , there are some where  Yeah .  Well , see , I I do a previous filtering before I give the Tigerfish ones out ,  and and I u I have tried to get the that particular the the "" missing segment "" removed .  But I don't always do it .  So yeah , you 've s they slip through .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Interesting .  OK , well , let 's see ,  so , um , do you think that this has changed your speech n in other ways ,  in terms of  Myself , I do feel that I 'm  when I spend a lot of hours doing this I become less fluent .  I have more false starts and things .  Yeah .  I don't know if it 's It could just be because there 're so many more hours I haven't been talking .  Good .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Oh ! Huh !  Hmm !  Hmm !  So mainly for clarity , it sounds like , like in phrasing or strategies .  Oh !  Oh .  I guess it depends partly on the type of interruption .  I mean , if it 's a clarifying type like "" well do you mean ? "" when they 're partway through it in a utterance .  Uh - huh . I think this is really  yeah .  I agree .  I did I did do one analysis wh where I looked at one meeting ,  and , um  th cuz the claim had been ,  actually o one of the people in the meeting had made the claim in the previous meeting that , "" Well , there probably the overlaps only occur during setup and , um , you know , at the end when we 're leaving . ""  Exactly . Exactly .  Well , and , you know , I think that that 's sort of the feeling you would get if unless you looked at the data at this level .  And so I did an analysis  and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate  all the way through the entire meeting  and everyone was involved .  Wasn't just one , you know , or two speakers .  ",,
Btr002.E,"Everyone was  Yeah . It 's quite true .  That 's true .  I should say , I didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions .  So some of these were backchannels and things like that .  But it 's still It 's still the case .  You have  y you  That 's true . That 's very true .  It 's true . That 's very rare .  I agree .  Interesting observation .  Yeah . Well , if they 're i c if this has raised a couple of things for me that I wanted to mention  because , you know , at this point , we 're at the at the really fine grain level of of standardization which I hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before ,  and , um , wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things .  These are ,  um  Yeah , I don't think that these are very common .  But with the idea that what we 're trying to do is encode the communicative stuff ,  um , when we have these grey areas ,  um , w um ,  I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought , and they 're coming out with a bunch of segments , which really aren't part of a word .  Have you run across that where they 're they 're saying  and then they say a word .  And , my feeling on that is , that this isn't really a phonological transcript ,  and potentially those things could probably be rendered ,  although some of them are not even full segments ,  they 're even sub s subsegmental , I would say .  I mean , you got a a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes ,  and , you know , they 're th it 's like the the apparatus is sort of almost kicking in ,  they 're almost gonna say  but it hasn't somehow this somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it  and and that 's not communicative .  So , um , my my the way I do those things when I hear those , if is to I use in parentheses one "" X "" so it 's marked .  Or if it 's @ @ then I then I put six or seven or however many it is  Great .  And then and then what I do is I put in , um , brackets , um , uncodeable Sorry , "" Uncodeable vocal sounds "" .  And of course , potentially they 're codable ,  but i I just wanted to mark roughly how man how long it is ,  then indicate what what the nature of it is , so no one 's gonna try and go back and and decode it as something that 's pechen a a word that was not It has a different status than parenthesized , uh , parts when there are words involved ,  just to set it aside ,  have some sort of a length indication ,  and sometimes I 'll even put them in a in a separate bin ,  although that 's that 's not necessary .  It 's just sometimes it works out that way that they @ @ ,  they do this thing .  I shouldn't do that so often .  I 'm sorry about that .  They do this sound ,  and then there 's a pause ,  and then they start speaking ,  so then it 's really obvious , I can I can split it apart and it won't be any problem .  I wanted to mention that one ,  yeah .  Well  Mm - hmm .  Excellent .  Oh , I see .  I see .  OK .  That 's OK .  It 's alright .  No problem .  No , no , no .  This is not  I wouldn't give it a second thought .  You sh  Yeah  Well , y you 've heard have you heard "" shoot "" ?  I 've heard "" shoot "" a couple of times .  No , no , no , no , no , no ,  the  "" shoot "" type , yeah .  Yeah ?  Oh .  I do remember that . Yeah .  That 's right . That 's right .  Yeah .  Uh - huh , yeah .  Yeah , it was .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  B but y t finish your point .  So , y  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  I agree . And I think there 's another problem too ,  and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative .  And and sometimes  So , if you have an "" ER "" as part of one of these fragments , we do have a lexicalized "" er ""  which is a which is a a filler item .  Does have a meaning .  So I think for both of the reasons it 's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a in a word - like way .  I would keep "" er "" .  Well , "" E "" "" er "" "" er "" if it 's a filler .  So , "" I mean , er , ""  th that that that stays .  But if it 's p uh , part on these little fragments , no .  Oh .  I 'm making a distinction .  So you have the , um , comic "" er "" where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't wanna say that ,  and then they throw in an "" er "" .  m and that would be an "" er "" .  ER .  ",,
Btr002.E,"But if they 're saying "" or "" in a reduced way so it comes out as "" er "" , do it as "" or "" .  Cuz that 's that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants .  It 's just like different ways of saying "" and "" .  OK .  And I have like , uh , uh , two more things I wanted to say .  One of them is , um  Oh , yeah .  This is an interesting category to me ,  and I don't , um , y y don't have to mark this systematically .  But when you 're going through the meeting , and what I 'd like people to do if if you 're not uh , uh is to go through the meeting ,  um  So , if you 're doing you 're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the mixed channel ,  I don't think I 've made that explicit  but it w it 's really helpful to go through it a a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context .  And at that point what I sometimes pick up is this meta - level , where someone is finishes someone 's someone else 's utterance .  So you 'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere , and it 's because  this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought , and they paused ,  and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word .  And I think those are interesting ,  so when I find that I I note note it as , you know , finishing  put capital letters .  Capital letter , capital letter , colon , apostrophe "" S "" , utterance .  Yeah .  So , if so in the examp i in the instance in which  Let 's say that , um , Morgan 's talking ,  uh , so , he 's talking .  And then somewhere there 's a bit of a pause ,  and let 's say Adam fills in a word for him .  Then what I do is , on Adam 's channel , I say I say , "" Completing "" And this this isn't that common of an occurrence . "" Completing speaker initial with a colon apostrophe "" S "" 's utterance "" .  And what that means is at the time when we  See we 're gonna go to a stage of anonymization .  So it 's important to have the colon here  because that 'll make it possible to easily know , you know , who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was .  The problem with  I originally wanted to use channel numbers as the referent index ,  but that that 's not functional  because we have these two different numbering schemes .  You have the numbering in the Channeltrans interface and you have the numbering in the "" key "" file  and those can be very different .  So , you know , to be able to ,  uh Th - this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you 're not gonna make a mistake .  I tried to do it with the numbers  and I was making all sorts of inconsistent problems , so I stopped it .  That 's that 's I did that partly to keep track of things .  Absolutely .  Absolutely .  Somet  The initials ?  I 'm glad to hear that .  I st I didn't do that systematically until , uh , really rather recently ,  so . I I 'm glad to know that 's useful .  It s takes an extra step .  Glad it 's useful .  OK , now I just have one more thing to say  and that is that ,  um , um ,  like once this is just such a rea  I 'm getting down to like the really eensy - weensy stuff .  But , um , once I found a comment that , uh , in in curly brackets about mumbling .  And , um ,  i g  that 's that 's this is just to mention an instance that happened once ,  it 's really grasping for details .  But , um ,  I I f I think , and it may be that it was not from anybody here ,  so .  But I think that , um , "" mumble "" is only useful in the s to me , in the sense of "" whispered "" ,  if it 's like a manner of speaking , in which case it 's a "" QUAL "" .  But not in terms of replacing , like , this string of undecipherable fragments .  So ,  um , this this was u when it was used  exactly .  It was used in place of , uh , something that was in unintelligible .  In which case , it would be better to use parentheses and and either exclamation , or the number of syllables , if you know .  Exactly . If it 's a manner of speaking , then it 's useful .  And otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better .  OK .  So , I guess , you know , I don't wanna keep you .  I kept you so long .  I really appreciate this .  Yes ?  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Oh . Yes .  Oh , but  Good question .  And you don't have to add any of those tags .  The only tags that you need to add , is  So th uh , there 's like one exception that 's just microscopic ,  and that is , sometimes  this is again really rare ,  sometimes I 've run across the word "" noise "" .  ",,
Btr002.E,"And offhand , I don't know if that 's a vocal noise or non - vocal noise .  And so then I listen to it and I figure it out .  But that 's the only place you would use a "" vocal "" "" non - vocal "" tag ,  where it 's potentially ambiguous between those two categories .  Cuz otherwise , what I do when I get these , is  and of course I do my checks ,  and then I have a , um a script that I wrote which will separate everything in out that has curly brackets ,  do a listing of them ,  and then anything  Some of them already have tags from some previous , uh , modification ,  but anything that doesn't , I just go through this list , and I I k tag it right then .  And so , in one in one in one change , I can modify , you know , five hundred instances of this .  So there 's no need to add the "" vocal "" or the "" non - vocal "" .  Yes .  You can either if you mark it "" mike noise "" then I 'll know what kind of noise it is when I go through the thing and put VOC or NVC on the in the substitution file .  But it 's it 's uh , very efficient for me to add those tags later .  It 's really not The same thing with the "" QUAL "" .  Just so long as I can tell which of those three categories it is .  Or or "" pron "" ,  but , you know , those that 's really very obvious ,  the pronunciation .  So long as I can tell what they are .  I think it 's good for you to add the "" pron "" .  I would appreciate the "" pron "" , come to think of it .  But the other three i just so long as it 's clear to me , w you know , from the comment which of those three it is , then I 'm fine .  That 's great .  Alright , so , um , I guess , um ,  Oh , thank you ,  do we have time ?  Would you mind ?  Can we do digits ?  OK , so why don't  do you wanna do it , uh , in unison this time ?  Oh we did !  Oh !  Do it separately , then . OK .  Good deal .  That is really what that time field is .  I used to think it was the beginning of the meeting ,  but yes .  Quite right . Quite right .  That 'd be good .  Yeah .  OK . So , who wants to start ?  Well , I guess I 'll start .  OK .  Transc - And the time is OK . Um ,  O eight . OK , I wanted to make one comment and that is , some of these are like two digits  and just be sure you say both digits separately .  So , one eight instead of eighteen .  OK .  OK .  OK . Wonderful .  Thank you very , very much .  I really appreciate this .  And , um , so now we get to turn the microphones off ,  and , uh  ",,
Btr002.F,"We have littler heads  so .  Hmm .  Mm - mmm .  Right .  i "" Ish decay "" ?  Yeah , what 's an "" ish "" ?  Yeah .  Oh .  Mm - hmm .  Actually , that comes back to a point .  We had talked about this last week , where you were interested in "" so "" .  Saying "" so "" at the end of something .  And sometimes that would get transcribed as  OK , so , let me just think of an example .  Um ,  OK , let 's say I say , "" Well , that would be hard to do , so . ""  OK , right ?

And ,  uh , this is the interpretation that came to mind or something ?  You know what I mean ?  Like , where would you get the word "" gruesome "" ?  You know , you just sort of pull it out of the air ?  Anyway .  Yeah .  OK .  Mmm - hmm .  Right .  "" Pss "" .  But this other business , um , that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel  is , uh is much more common .  Right .  And what 's always funny to me is when it 's th you know , they m mi miss the gender completely ,  like , you know , Morgan 'll be on Jane 's channel ,  or just something bizarre like that .  Um , so .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Fancy - schmancy .  If I was gonna make just a guess , though , from my experience it would seem like the men get mis um ,  the men get moved onto other channels , maybe more frequently .  And it 's just probably cuz they have deeper voices  and they 're getting picked up on more channels , um , than their own channel .  Um , for w you know , it 's an acoustic thing .  Yeah .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah .  Yeah , you could see it coming and you 'd turn the volume down or something .  But sometimes you 'll see like something coming up  like , "" Uh - oh .  Someone 's gonna cough really loudly "" ,  and I could tell because of the way it looks !  Or "" someone 's about to laugh really loudly "" ,  um yeah ,  and then you 're just sort you 've got like you know you 're sort of like  Yeah .  So unless there 's gonna be some speech in there , I don't think I need to listen that carefully .  Yeah .  So .  Yeah .  You could h really hurt your ears . Yeah .  Oh , yeah .  So .  Gives some good clues ,  yeah .  Oh yeah . Yeah .  Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though ,  and so sometimes you have to , um , try to listen  there 's no visual  but  Yeah , you have to the resolution ,  right ?  So .  Hmm .  Just to jump it back .  Right , cuz sometimes you 'll hear It 'll be in right in the middle of the timebin ,  and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again  cuz you 've already gotten the first part .  So you just want it to go back ,  I don't know  That 's true .  Hmm . Yeah .  Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go .  Yeah , you were having some wrist problems and stuff ,  right ?  Yeah .  Yeah . Ooh !  I do that with the mouse , yeah .  Oh .  Mmm .  Oh yeah .  Yeah .  Oh yeah , I do find that the keyboard is different here than it is even at my s for my school computer  and so I 'll al I 'll just be  if I was just at school , and I come here , it 's just  or vice versa  it 's just , uh it 's like I 'll I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different ,  and I have to just get used just get used to it again  Yeah , the backspace is in the wrong place .

Yeah the hardest thing 'd be finding them .  Cuz I would get the whole tr I 'd get the whole transcript of the meeting  and you had to find them .  You 'd have to find where the digits were .

When people get really loopy ,  and start telling lots of jokes , I think .  I enjoy always transcribing those sections .  It 's yeah , it seems to be more at the end .  Like  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah , they 'll be joking around .  Wait , a favorite what ?  Oh , you mean like , eh , meeti like like , um , Meeting Recorder as opposed to EDU as oppo  Like , those groups ?  Oh .  I 've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers .  No !  When you guys were saying that last week , I was like "" Never heard that . ""  Yes .  I did that .  And whistles .  He was it I you must have been sittin There was a meeting where there was this guy ,  he was making these funky sounds  and making funny whistles ,  and you must have been sitting next to him  cuz you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it .  And he was like , "" Yeah , I can make dogs , uh , raise their ears  cuz I can whistle so high . ""  And you were like , w "" That 's fascinating . ""  I remember that meeting .  I thought it was pretty funny .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Mmm .  Yeah !  Oh , yeah .  Yeah . Cool !  Sure .  No .  Sure .  I mean , just weird things like before  like , I had kind of a weird thing happen ,  and we 'd talked about it .  It was when I 'd first started working on the project I got this discussion where  this was before we had the different channels ,  and , um , Dan Ellis it was when Dan Ellis was still here  so it was like kind of early on , right ?  And , um ,  he everyone 's talking ,  and then all of the sudden , you hear Dan talking to someone else  and it 's different people that you 'd never heard before .  And and what he had done , is he had left the room to g  He 'd li and he had brought the microphone with him .  And this is without the channelized interface .  So you you have no idea .  You think everyone 's just become schizophrenic or something .  And they 're all like in they 're own r world or something  because Then all of the sudden he 's talking about a co he needs a copy machine .  And I don and I 'm just assuming , well he 's s s still in the room  and what the heck 's he talking about ?  But just sort of just weird things like that ,  and , um Yeah , he had just left the room  and gone and made a copy  and he still had his microphone on ,  and then you could hear the the the r the women behind the desk talking to him ,  and just sort of stuff like that .  It was just really bizarre .  So .  Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that .  Yeah .  Yeah .  So .  They take longer to do .  In a way they 're more fun , though .  There 's just more variety .  Who won't talk .  And to breathe .  There 'll be lots of breathing . Yeah .  Did you guys ever ,  when This happened to me when I first started transcribing ,  cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before ,  but , um ,  I would leave here ,  and I would go out and do my daily business ,  and I would hear people speaking to me ,  and I would transcribe them in my head !  I 'd imagine what I would type .  It went away , like maybe after a couple of weeks ,  but it was just bizarre .  Really ?  ",,
Btr002.F,"Oh . No , for me it was unconscious .  It was I didn't mean for to be doing it .  It would just intru it was an intrusion .

Had she changed her perfume ?  Oh , wow .  Oof !  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  Right .

Not literally what people are saying  and so ,  you know , all the "" uh "" "" uh 's "" and "" um 's "" , and all those different things ,  we just tune it out ,  yeah .

I just make a mouth  Cuz I think I had talked to you about this about  what what did we do cuz wha what was it that I  oh , I was  "" Lipsmack "" !  I was marking "" lipsmack "" ,  and and you said  yeah , that 's It 's a different noise ,  but , um ,  it 's what made me think of it ,  but , um ,  and and you said , "" Don't do "" lipsmack "" ,  just do we don't need it 's too specific .  Just do "" mouth "" for all tha all those noises "" .  Um  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Oh , right .  Yeah .  Right .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Oh .  If it 's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense , too .  Hmm .  Yeah , once , Adam was laughing ,  and it was actually written out phonetically ,  and I changed it .  I 'm like "" it 's just laughing "" .  Like somebody had written , like "" hyuh - hyuh "" or or or something .  And  Yeah , i I it was maybe Tigerfish had done something  like they had written out a phonetic laugh ,  and they didn't do it at any other place in the transcript .  It was just that one spot .  It was just a regular old vanilla laugh , you know .  It wasn't anything special .  Well  well , here 's a question ,  and there 's been some variance in transcripts that I 've looked at .  When  OK .  So when you laugh , you 're exhaling all this air ,  and so you need to i inhale ,  and so how do you transcribe the inhale ?  Some people are transcribing it as a breath .  I I used to , you know , back in the day back when I was do transcribing , I would do the whole thing as a laugh  because to me the breath is part of the laugh .  Um , so cuz i cuz in the ones I 've been che the one I 've been checking actually right now , that breath gets marked as a breath ,  and I 've been taking them out .  So that 's OK ?  Actually , it 'd be a "" laugh ""  and then two dots ,  like the next bin will be empty ,  and then it 'll be "" breath "" .  And so it 'll be that  it 'll be three d sort of separate units as opposed to I think it 's sort of one coherent thing .  So .  Oh , well , yeah , that 's that 's a different thing .  Yeah . S cuz sometimes it 's not clear .  Like sometimes "" Hhh ! "" is a laugh .  Um , and if other people are laughing , then I 'll usually give them and say that they 're laughing .  Mm - hmm . Exactly .  Mm - hmm .  So .  Right .  Good . OK .  Yeah .  Well they give the segmenter , though  cuz they don't have the the rich interface that we do ,  so the they must be giving the pre - segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt ,  "" Well , there must be something there , um , whether I can hear it or not . ""  So , they just say , "" Well , it 's a breath then "" .  Yes !  That 's true .  Hmm .  Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice .  Cuz then you 'll hear you 'll hear part of what another person is saying and th tha and that 's all transcribed on that one level ,  but then you 'll hear a little bit of it and then "" missing segment "" .  It 's like , "" OK , well they just it 's in the wrong  That person 's not talking at all "" .  So , you just get rid of it .  So .  Hmm !  Oh , yeah . That 's true .  Oh yeah , that 's totally not true .  Mm - hmm .  It 's rare .  Yeah .  I was wondering who had been putting those in .  Yes .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Man !  I do that too !  I used to do that !

I mean , it 's to some extent , uh , for his benefit .  So ,  if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful .  Right .  I thought you did that on purpose .  But anyway , shall we do the roll call ?  Mari on channel zero .  Hmm .  Right .  Right .  So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors .  So ,  uh , u u  So , actually there 's kind of three issues .  There 's the CrossPad issue .  Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  Um , do we have s people write summaries ?  Everybody or one person ?  And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ?  Is that  Right .  Right .  Right .  Right .  They  Yeah .  Right .  OK .  Yeah .  W  How about this idea ?  That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker .  And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ?  Right .  Right .  Well  Yeah .  Yeah  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , what it does  Well , what it does is provide a different  I I think it 's an interesting thing .  I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se ,  but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say "" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? ""  Well , yeah .  I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah .  And at least that gives you the word that they might run a query on .  Right .  It 'll tell you the hit but not the query .  Right .  w  Well , th you could do  I think the summaries actually may help get us there ,  for a couple reasons .  One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings .  So "" action item "" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever .  So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about .  Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying "" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? ""  Well  That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary ,  and you want to ask questions to get more detail .  Mmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Right .  I th  No .  I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker .  Somebody who 's part of the meeting .  Well  I think it serves two purpo purposes .  One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries ,  but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries .  And then it 's you know , it 's kind of a key .  Uh  Well , i i ?  Or , d o  What I I think , you know , in most meetings ,  this one being different ,  but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  Um , you can just make it be on a laptop ,  so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII  and not somebody  you don't have to go through handwriting recognition .  Um , and then they post - edit it into , uh , a summary  and they email it out for minutes .  I mean , that happens in most meetings .  Right .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  Right .  So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion .  ","what can you add to it to get , um , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ?  So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors .

Buw001.A,"And I agree ,  technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes .  Right .  Mmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  No , no , no , no .  So  e  Mm - hmm .  What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ?  I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you .  Yeah .  Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be  I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking ,  in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  Uh , I mean , we uh , we don't need to require it .  Just like the  I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting .  Um ,  so so we won't worry about requiring these things ,  but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications .  So .  Well , before we leave the CrossPads and and call it done .  So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ?  So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it ,  um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna  n  I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do .

So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ?  And then  Mm - hmm .  But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it ,  because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door .  So ,  you 're probably not gonna get a lot of people wanting to do this .  Right .  Yeah . I think that I think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time .  I just don't  because they 're kind of a captive audience .  Once they leave ,  you know , forget it .  But but i  Right .  But , uh , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay .  But , you know , if you get even one  Yeah .  Yeah .  For a little while I thought it was just that I was really tired .  That and y Too much caffeine and really tired ,  but then I thought "" no , maybe that 's real "" .  Yeah ?  Um , what 's our schedule ?  Let 's see ,  you and I need dis Uh ,  no , we did the Liz talk .  Yeah .  So so that was the prosody thing .  Um , we need to finish the  It 's already four - fifteen .  Uh , after .  We need to finish this discussion , and you  and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart .  So ,  um  Um , what what 's the plan for this discussion ?  We should  Uh , less .  Yeah .  So , I think  Action  Yeah .  So ,  e e why don't you say five - thirty ?  I don't  Is that OK ?  We 'll probably hit horrible traffic .  That 's not a lot of time ,  but  Hmm .  But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting .  You get two  Yeah , that 's true .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea .  But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned ,  for those pe people willing to stay .  And and that might be something people are willing to stay for .  That 's fine .  Mm - hmm .  Right .  Uh  Yeah .  Well , I That 's hard to generate  and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for .  But I also a lot of times um , make you know , think to myself "" this is interesting ,  I 've gotta come back and follow up on it "" .  So , things that I think are interesting , um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about .  And also , I like the idea of going around the room ,  because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it  ","OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens .  So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ?  because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door .  you 're probably not gonna get a lot of people wanting to do this .

In the interest of , um ,  generati generating an interesting summary , um  No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here ,  uh , and also moving on to action items and other things ,  let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important ,  um , that we at least decided on .

Buw001.A,"So , I 'll I 'll send him email .  I 'll put it in an action item that I send him email about it .  And if I get something , great .  If I don't get something  Landay .  And , uh , um ,  you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers  or  I could I could use , uh I could use your web pages .  That 's what we could do .  You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor  Yeah !  Oh , forget this !  I One less action item .  I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders .  Yeah .  So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox ,  CMU ,  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Great . That solves that problem .  One less action item .  Um  OK . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of .  Oh , yeah .  I don't think we should have rules of participation ,  but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings .  That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys ,  cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here .  But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over  and and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW .  So , I think that that there 's a good chance we could get more variety .  Um ,  Mm - hmm .  Right .  OK .  So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction  but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people  and different sizes .  e e  Yeah .  And then the other thing might be , um , uh , technical versus administrative .  Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap ,  because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever .  Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , uh , unintrusive as possi  as you could be with these things hanging on you .  Is that an action item ?  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Oh .  Yes , we should do that .  They 're related to this morning 's meeting .  I think I think "" pass "" is socially acceptable .  But I will say uh , I will actually  uh , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said ,  this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take minutes ,  and that actually may be a goal .  So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data ,  uh , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary .

Buw001.B,"I think Well , this should be off the record ,  but I think  Yeah , I know .  It just it really hurts .  It gives you a headache ,  like if you  On your temple  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah , with the We kno I know .  We know exactly how much you have left in your cup .  Were we gonna do digits ?  You can write them on the board , if you want .  Liz , on channel one .  Actually  And so  I actually want to say something about the note pad .  So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when .  That 's all you  And , you can also have notes of the meeting .  But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down .  I mean , you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said .  It may not be kept in the later summary ,  but at that point in time is was something that was important .  And that wouldn't take any extra  Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad  and go like that if you want to .  It 's  Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time  and find out what they were talking about .  And you r  And  Yeah .  But I bet it 's a good superset of it .  At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords  and  Right , right .  But I think I think thinking about queries is a little bit dangerous right now .  We don't even know what  I mean , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user ,  but I mean a different domain and a different user  Um .  The summary is actually gonna drive the queries then .  I mean , your research is going to be very circular .  Right .  But you could always post - hoc label them .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Maybe Landay can put a student in to be a note - taker .  No ?  No , I mean , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker  And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on ,  and they can use it for their research .  I mean , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system ,  because that that 's a lot of trouble  and maybe it 's not the best way to do it .  But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings ,  and get the notes from the note - taker or something .  Mm - hmm .  So how does the summary get generated ?  I 'm not against the idea of a summary ,  but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it  and how  because the summary will drive the queries .  So  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  OK .  Dan ?  Y you should also have a record of what 's on the board .  I mean , I find it very hard to reconstruct what 's going on .  I I don't know how  I don't know how ,  but for instance , I mean , the outline is sort of up here  and that 's what people are seeing .  And if you have a  Or you shou could tell people not to to use the boards .  But there 's sort of this missing information otherwise .  Uh , y  Right .  Yeah .  People who were never at the meeting will have a very hard time understanding it otherwise .  Even people who were at the meeting .  I don't mean that you model it .  We should just  Like archiving it or storing it .  Because someone  someone later might be able to take these and say "" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there  and here 's sort of what they started talking about ,  and ""  and just  Big , big interest .  Huge .  I mean , it personally , I don't I would never want to deal with it .  But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in .  You know , fusing gesture and face recognition ,  even lip movement and things like that ,  for this kind of task .  And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect  so that later we can do other things with it .  And  I think even doing something very crude  Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time .  And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening ,  even though you w you just got the speech from the machine .  So if you can find some really , you know , low , uh , perplexity ,  ","So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad .

Buw001.B,"yeah , way of of doing that , I think it would be worthwhile .  Otherwise you 'd you lose it .  Also CMU has been doing this  and they were the most vocal at this meeting ,  Alex Waibel 's group .  And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time  and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room .  So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all .  Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head  and not look at each other  and not look at boards ,  and just all be sitting talking .  That would be an interes Bu  Yeah . I definitely won't participate if there 's a camera .  No , it wa n not , um  Not for not for CMU .  They have a pretty crude set - up .  And they had  they just turn on these cameras .  They were they were not moving or anything .  And stored it on analog media .  And they they didn't actually align it or anything .  They just they have it , though .  Hmm - mm .  I think they just  I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something .  Um ,  I 'm not sure .  Yeah .  I 'm just The community  If LDC collects this data u I mean , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there .  And so that could argue for us not doing it  or it could argue for us doing it .  The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , um , easier made easier if you had the video .  Mmm .  Of the board .  Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board .  That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured .  I mean , otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  Right . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , um , is in the record .  Ow .  I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept .  It will  You know , what you can do with things .  Yeah . But not not to rely on them for basic modeling .  I just wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those .  Yeah .  It 's just  I 'd be sort of cool .  I mean , it would  Yeah .  That w shouldn't be hard for  Without hearing each other though , probably .  Well , then you should try them a few weeks later  and  They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain  and wasn't  Right , right .  Oh , it is it is like OK .  Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ?  I mean , this is an issue that goes a little bit beyond where we are right now .  They 're the expert  We - I don't remember it .  I have like no recall memory .  It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free  yet it 's separate .  But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries .  That 's what I 'm worried about .  So you might as well just give him the summaries .  And  Oh , OK .  How to do this  from the summary .  So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . Are we gonna later go over it  and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer ,  or or a deeper  Yeah .  I mean  But that 's done off they have to do that off - line .  You  That 's a good one .  Dan doesn't know what sex he is .  Ah  Going to see the kids .  I think I just wanted to say one thing about queries .  I mean , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level .  And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ?  So you need to have some sort of  if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the  you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha  You know , you can gen you can ask queries that are meaningful for people .

Buw001.B,"Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you .  I mean , in gen that 's all I remember from most meetings .  So , in general , I mean , that could be something you could say , right ?  I 'm supposed to do this .  It it doesn't  I mean , that 's realistically what people might well be remembering .  So .  Yeah .  Yeah .

And then  Right .  J There 's  th  That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera ,  because of all these classroom  Yeah .  They 're still gonna overlap ,  but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic  and also the political  Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap .  So .  Like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting .  Mm - hmm .  And there was a big division ,  so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data .  So there 's lots of recordings that  They 're not close - talk mike ,  but  And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , um , political debates and things like that ,  congre congressional hearings .  Boring stuff like that .  Um ,  and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in  cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this  and said that those are nothing like these meetings .  Um , so there 're really two different kinds of data .  And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it ,  but newly collected data would would be natural meetings .  So .  As far as I know , they h have not .  Um , but e  I 'm not sure .  Um ,  if people were interested they could talk to them ,  but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved .  No .  I I don't know .  I mean , the  I think you need to talk to Waibel  and  But they had multiple mikes  and they did do recognition ,  and they did do real conversations .  But as far as I know they didn't offer that data to the community at this meeting .  But that could change  cuz Mark you know , Mark 's really into this .  We should keep in touch with him .

I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up ,  and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself ,  so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it  because we don't have funding on it , uh , in this project .  But , um , it 's definitely something I would want to do something on .  ","Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible  So if you could ask other people to call and use our system , that 'd be good .

Buw001.D,"Hmm .  Uh , OK .  Mm - hmm .  So are we recording now ?  Is this  Oh ! We 're we 're we 're live .  OK .  So , uh , what were we gonna talk about again ?  So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing .  No . I it 'd be even better with this big  It 's not that long .  w u  Oh , yeah , the element ,  yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible .  Yeah .  Alright .  So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection ,  and , um , uh , you you put up there data format ,  and other tasks during data collection ,  and  I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were .  Roll call .  No , not a  No , I just My mind went elsewhere .  So ,  uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan ,  and  where am I ?  I 'm on channel three .  I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel  Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones .  There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know .  Yeah .  I mean , we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design ,  and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us .  So .  Yeah .  That that 's right .  There were others of course .  Yeah .  Right .  We can go back .  There 's there 's another problem  which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder .  And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously .  And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do ,  how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group  and and , uh , they were fine with it .  But if we 'd said , "" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , uh , the summar ""  t See ?  There we go .  I  I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random ,  uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing .  Well , I think that we I mean , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings  and send them off to IBM  and get a bunch of transcriptions  even if they 're slightly flawed  or need some other  And then we 'll have some data there .  And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things  and at the very least .  Hmm .  Mm - hmm .  It  That 's a good idea  but that doesn't  Maybe I 'm missing something ,  but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ?  Yeah .  That that 's what I mean , is that I think it gets at something interesting  but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , um , "" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? "" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking .  Does it ?  Maybe .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that  because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface  and he 's looking at the query in in  i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff  but we have zero hours of of of queries .  So he 's just sort of going "" where where do I where do I start ? ""  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Hmm .  Yeah .  I 've b been thinking  I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the uh , th this , e um  I think that the  now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable , uh , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at .  It 's it 's not ideal ,  but we you know , we we have to get started someplace .  So I was I was just thinking about , um , suppose we wanted to get  w We have this collection of meeting .  We have five hours of stuff .  Uh , we get that transcribed .  So now we have five hours of meetings  and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , "" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ?

Buw001.D,"So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go "" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting ,  I remember that ,  um , what was the part that ""  And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Well , yeah . That 's true too .  Mm - hmm .  A  Adam , you can  you can correct me on this ,  but but , uh , my impression was that , uh , pretty much , uh , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w uh , with a laptop  and  I  Yeah , but those are bigger deal things .  Right ?  Where you 've got fifteen peo  I mean , most  th this is one of the larger meetings .  Most of the meetings we have are four or five people  and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it .  You just get together and talk about where you are .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Do they ?  Yeah .  Li  uh , L L  L  Liz , you  u uh , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , uh , subcommittee meeting or whatever  uh , on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the , uh that workshop we were at that , uh , uh , Mark Liberman was was having .  So I I wasn't there .  They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  So so to address what what Adam 's saying ,  I mean , I think you uh , that  the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .  And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it .  Right ?  So , uh  Right .  So we 're gonna  So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do ,  whatever 's reasonable for us .  But having  Well , minimally , I mean , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people ,  cuz we are interested in some spatial processing .  And so  so , um  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Uh - huh .  Great idea .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I think for I mean , for our purposes we probably will d  we we might try that some  and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that ,  uh , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think .  There you go .  I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing .  As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to ,  uh , and and will include all that .  Um ,  I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up .  I 'm worried about the cost of people looking at it .  In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all .  And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing .  But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , uh , subsets of that .  Like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards ,  and  a  and know the position of the people  Yeah .  So  So , I mean , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do ,  uh , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , uh , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody  from from today ?  OK .  So .  Um  So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection .  And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea ,  uh , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that .  Right ?  And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries  and are we gonna do anything about that .  Oh , OK .  Yeah .  What  I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff .  So it 's sort of Landay supplying it  so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do .  So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero ,  and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou  I mean , at least try it .  Yeah .  Yeah .

I think you get two different types of information .  Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about .  So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary .  But with the "" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? ""  Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting  and that and that Dan worked on on that .  So I thought that was really  you know .  So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings  but could be very informative .  I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either .  You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment .  Yeah .  Yeah .  Yeah .  And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the  some some of the little things that would be hidden .  That would be interesting .  Uh - huh .  Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying "" important "" and we 're saying "" interesting "" .  And and those those can be two different things .  Mm - hmm .  OK , good .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I will say that that I I chose "" interesting ""  because I think it includes also "" important ""  in some cases .  But , um , I I I feel like the summary gets at a different type of information .  Well , and and also  i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate .  You know , I think inter "" interesting "" is is non - threatening in  Yeah .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  k  Sure .  That 's good .  I like that .  I like that .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  A  And one and one qualification on on the oral summaries .  They 'd be s they 'd be separate .  They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries .  And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  Mm - hmm .  I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries  which is indicator phrases like "" action item "" ,  which could be obtained from the text from the transcript .  Yeah .  Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified ,  but text - oriented .  I think you 'd remember that , yeah .  Yeah , that 's true .  Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , "" other than your action item "" ,  you know , whatever .  But but the action item would be a way to get , uh , maybe an additional query .  So .  Yeah .  Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @  Yeah .  Yeah . yeah .  Good .  OK .  So y  Sure , sure , sure .  You could email to both of us , uh , just I mean , if you wanted to .  I mean , I don't think either of us would mind recei  but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the  Edwards at  ICSI .  Yeah , using foot pedals  and  Yeah . They they don't have a way .

Buw001.H,"But they have a verification .  I did .  I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL ,  um , the on - line , uh , data that Adam set up ,  The URL  so they can click on an utterance and hear it .  and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions  which you got a copy of today .

It relates to data data collection  and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  um , so ,  um , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened .  But I wonder if Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ?  So either by rules of participation , or whatever .  Now , I mean , you know , it 's true ,  I mean , we were discussing this earlier ,  that depending on the task  so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap .  But , um ,  i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway .  But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ?  OK .  OK .  Just want to be sure there 's enough data to  OK , good .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  On the task , and the task .  It 's just  I just wanted to uh ,  because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to .  Not not entirely modify it ,  but lessen it if if it 's desired .  But if if that 's sufficient data  I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed .  Time .  Fine . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree .  I just wanted to be sure .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Well , I just as as as a contributary  eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping .  They 'll just say , you know you know , "" wait till each person is finished before you say something "" .  So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to .  But but these other factors are fine .  I just wanted to raise the issue .  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm .  Oh , yeah .  Yeah , I think that 's always desired .  I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can .  Yeah .  Yeah , I think  u e e  Yeah .  Yeah , I am .  So , I w uh , just just for clarification .  So "" found data "" ,  they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ?  It sounds like such a t  Yeah , OK .  OK .  But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields .  OK .  Exactly .  Yeah . OK , OK .  That 's interesting .  Mm - hmm .  OK .  Yeah .  Just wanted to know .  Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things  which is that , um ,  I I found this discussion very , uh , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting .  And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be  because it depends on what your purpose is .  So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting .  But that 's not really a specific fact .  I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there ,  which I thought was worthwhile .  Mm - hmm .  Yeah .  That 's a good point .  Yeah .  Oh .
