ES2004a.A,"you can guess what i'm trying to make ? simplification of symbols you could think of . instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h have an l_c_d_ di display like that , ",The group introduced themselves to each other and practiced with the meeting room tools by drawing on the board. Then the group began a discussion about their own experiences with remote controls to generate initial design ideas for making the product user-friendly. They discussed grouping features into a menu and adding an LCD display. 
ES2004a.B,"i'm sarah , the project manager this is our agenda , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . we want it to be original , trendy , appealing to a wide market , and user friendly , grannies to kids , even pooches should be able to use it . first is the functional design , this is where we all go off and do our individual work , what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , what effects the product has to have conceptual design , and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , and sum up the characteristics of that animal . i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . finance wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five euros , which i don't actually that is in pounds , that's expensive . i'll be able to pull it up , or i could put it in the shared folder production cost's at twelve fifty , and profit aim is fifty million euros , what are your experiences with remote controls ? i've got we got we had three videos , a t_v_ and a amp thing all set up we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals but that was quite good , the fact that you could you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and a section opens up to the other functions where you can do sound or options recording , things like that inside it . what about the older generation ? i don't like the , the new phones that have got a windows based running system . i find it really confusing , that's a cost thing , we've got half an hour before the next meeting , we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . and then we'll come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation . there's sky remote controls and everything . they're moulded and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , guess that's we can think about . let's break it up there . see you in half an hour .

ES2004a.D,"a dog ? it's meant to be an eagle seventeen . should we be making notes of this ? you've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a accessible and usable by all age groups my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , and symbols that you don't necessarily understand , but on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , you've got a little l_c_d_ display . that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , something that's easily moulded and produced . we don't have to use metal , ","The group introduced themselves to each other and practiced with the meeting room tools by drawing on the board.

ES2004b.A,"actually some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we'll take a feedback from the marketing and to summarise i would say it's it should be user friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering having hundred buttons and having remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . what the concept is to have a flip top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip top . and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used thirty to forty percent of the buttons we can go for an economies of a higher production we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . if you ask me personally , i would make flip top with a trendy design and s we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . are we talking of a single model or five , six designs ? the features could be same and the body could look slightly different . for u_s_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and in japan and all you need to have a small , for a phone he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . they came up with something like this , curled up , here , it's like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat . i wouldn't say exactly semi circular but smooth . we could come at some say five , six des designs ","The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface. A customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly, but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget. They discussed the functions the remote will have, including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries. The group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers. "
ES2004b.B,"this is our second meeting right our agenda for today , i'll go over what we decided last meeting , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . we discussed a flip open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . three presentations , i've got written here shall we hear from marketing first ? if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , we have new project requirements , we're not going to be using teletext , our control is only going to be for t_v_ , it's not going to be a combined control , sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i don't know , what do you think ? but general t_v_ controls do video as we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming . we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing on the t_v_ you could put like a pack on the t_v_ you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v_ and it beeps the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , i'm thinking japan , i'm thinking young , office people , we have to design one product the remote control functions . we've got the t_v_ , we've got the video , now there's can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , if you look in the newspaper , t_v_ guide or any t_v_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards instruction manuals . there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to but we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible what other functions ? i'm not if we need a design decision now , batteries , that's what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night something like that should reduce the size of it . rechargeable with a docking station . th the shape you got trendy . if it was a c_ like that , you could have it in a vague c_ shape that opens up like a shell , you could have different casings . you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and and we've talked about there being an alarm a beeping for being lost , and the i the instruction manual , i don't know if we deal with that , you can email me , if there's any more questions .

ES2004b.C,"this is the working design , what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? a device which just sends the signal to the t_v_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i'm not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky d i didn't know if you wanted to look at something else we could shrink down the size of the control . if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , you can get the circular round ones now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . and then you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i_ interface which would when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the t_v_ receiver , which means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using all the components that i've put forward are low in cost it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , because they're small they're also easy to lose if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let where it is you could have a number of different designs video plus . and you wouldn't need whole host of extra buttons for that , but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract but i'm not how much the cost would be of having instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that . if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could ","The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote.

ES2004b.D,"is it if i postpone that til later , you're saying the triple a_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? i'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view we used our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , our findings , lots of findings , i've just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , but that's quite a high proportion of our , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they've lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we didn't put to them , but which i'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , if there's any more information email you extra details , would that imply video use ? further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , i've not come across that function but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that's what led us on to comparing t_v_ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? many remote controls look identical , that's that sounds a really attractive idea , even though we're using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament can quickly go over the new project requirements that i haven't missed anything . it's no teletext , it's only for t_v_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus . and the rechargeable batteries . that's not at the moment a requirement , what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? we're at lunchtime now ","He presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design.

ES2004c.B,"right this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves this is where we talk about properties , materials , user interface and trend watching . the minutes from the last time . we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , i'm pretty that solar is from the sun . if we're doing the kinetic thing instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , that's been really popular with mobile phones don't see why not . it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . you were sitting watching t_v_ are you gonna want to open it and say shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t_ can we swap that round th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? i'm not how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we've discussed . do we agree on the battery ? that means that there's no function for li the port , we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , the l_c_d_'s not cheap . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , you could have plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little you just address that with advertising . it'll have a logo on it just like everything , that it's got to stand out somehow differently right i'm going to wrap it up there . it says , closing we have forty minutes think we've probably got about that time before we come back .

ES2004c.C,"this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . this is the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what's used in every remote control it sends out standard signals , based on your input and then we're loo looking into battery options . there's actually no rechargeable option available , i saw the the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be a bit silly to be honest , you wind up your remote control before you use it . like the solar charging , most people have the light on in the room anyway they could get when you got t_v_ . but the next one's the best anyway . the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up , do i d i'm not entirely how long it would last but i've never seen one run out . ye th y you could have a dual power thing but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case on a calculator they're qui they're quite big and they all look i identical . the normal batteries would be the cheapest most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b_ board which pr printed circuit board , the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be now what i was thinking about that was sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , you can see what all the buttons are , but you could have lights behind the buttons the case material , i've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there's the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing you could go for wood but it would be a bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , perhaps some something made of rubber , if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do curved shapes . but that an l_c_d_ type of screen the problem with it is that it's flat and you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , you could have a flat screen inside , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti r_s_i_ . but they could get a bit easily lost , the kinetic ones come with watch a battery that goes in a watch . the think were we're going for the l_c_d_ on that one , on the buttons , on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , on we've got the flip screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . depending on the expense of it .

ES2004c.D,"and this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . there also seems to be trend towards a spongy feel to materials , referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research , but it's something to put on the side to think about i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , i don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we had a shell , once we open that is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing . did we decide on double a_ or triple a_ batteries ? we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more and incorporating the company logo ? took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?

ES2004d.C,"and i'll show you the presentation . and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there . it's gonna have a plastic body with a standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue this is underneath the rubberised outer casing which there'd be wide choice the wide choice of colours and patterns , it's an a clam shell design and the the top l_c_d_ screen that you can see that would b would be how do you say , it's it would be inset into the top it'll fully close flat . and the buttons at the bottom would d we've already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were coming in and they were fairly easy to get a hold of , we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where is the remote and it'll shout back , i'm here , the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the t_v_ using all the standard chips that we've talked about . it's split over two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , it would be joined at the hinge through some cabling . and because , all t_v_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data . and the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the t_v_ . and then finally on to the interface . the top screen , as we said , is would be an inset black and white l_c_d_ s touch screen which would have all of the available functions for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect . and now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have some bezzled logo on it , inset , or an engraving of the logo on the top . and finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo . i'd give it a one . the base colour was white or like or l light blue , but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any any one of a number of colours that th it's full customised . th that's the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , i'll give it a one as i'd i'd f i'd go for a five , actually , it was voice recognition , that that's feasible . it would be quite loud . i do realise that we might be being fairly biased , it is our product ,  it was a regular chip on print you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . it's two . and l_c_ display one . the push button's one it it would make one difference . but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . if you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . i don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . that'll do it . twelve point three five . is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's good . it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , it would've come out a d little different , we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had more time and if we'd been separated more .

ES2004d.D,"this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research . the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , we're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . i won't write all of that out again . it will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . i'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . criteria a_ , the fancy look and feel . my own rating for that would be a two . two and three quarters ? criteria b_ , criterion b_ , technologically innovative . i would give that a three . ease of use . based on what you've said there , i would say a one , true . i'm just thinking , before i give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . in that case it's got to be a one for me . to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . it incorporates current fashion trends , i don't think we've really touched on that a lot . we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? i'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . and finally , last but not least , easy to locate . now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost wise . that's a one for me . we've got our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there . that is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . the lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? we happy to go ahead ? for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . i'll just leave it there . it would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing . there's nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing . do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ? if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? we can put in our recommendations . if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers if we take voice recognition out although we had our separate tasks , there was much interaction , much that we needed to bounce off each other . in that in relevant areas we've been able to , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? could it've been better , it's really borrowing from other areas , it's , bringing things from other areas in , ",The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals.

ES2014b.B,"i'm gonna be looking at the working design . i've just got three sections , first is the research i made on the remote control itself and then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual remote . having researched the existing models within the market , found my research off the internet . i've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do the basic components are an energy source which in most existing models would be a battery supply . we then have the user interface , which is the like the buttons on the actual remote . the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that . there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . and then the sender , which is usually , i've found , an infra red device which sends a signal to the actual television . and the last part is receiver which is important in the system because that's found in the television . i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery .  we then have a particular button , that's there's lots and lots of different buttons . after you press that sends the message to the chip , and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . that's the components of the remote this is the user interface . which then , and that's the infra red sender . and then on the separate thing we have on the television we have a receiver . going on to personal preferences , i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . and then the sender , and infra red has been used quite successfully . would you be able to get rid of the extra buttons here , the circular section , because that seems to be for a video as we could dispense with that little bit as and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . how many buttons have we got ? we've just got ten , eleven twelve th and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for the speech recognition . and possibly the thing about the remote being lost we could have with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . we can have some sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some buzzer system between the two . you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . or like the same technology could be put inside the remote . you could have an option to turn it off . or that would solve the problems with the t_v_ speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . did we decide on having the ten the ten numbers and then the little digit next to it which enabled you to put them together . i'll put delay to allow multiple numbers . you only have to probably tune in the t_v_ once , and if finally the t_v_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . would you have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . that is a good idea actually . we're gonna have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as about the number . the volume up and down . a mute button as but then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . are we gonna have the channel up and down as as the number buttons ? we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . shall we look into that and just get back together .

ES2014b.C,"i'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , that a desired function is performed . here are two example remotes . by the look of it they both have play and fast forward , rewind functions , think they incorporate a video function which we won't have to worry about . but as you can see , the left remote is quite quite busy looking , quite complicated . whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . my personal preference would be the right remote . it's got big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . like the use of the symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as as the words on the play functions and all that . it's very user friendly , and i don't really think that you need nine numbers . how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . some remotes have favourite options but lot of like cable and sky and that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . but i suppose nine's not really excessive . there's key rings that you whistle at or clap at , and then they whistle back , like that . that'd probably be really simple , think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some whistle back function . i don't really know about the voice recognition thing . we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? you do need brightness and contrast and everything as if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as have you seen those remotes where the bottom bit slides down , there's everything else revealed ? you don't use it that much , and that'll be better for the older generation as i know it's probably like not an issue to raise here , but the whole thing about not using your standby because of the like waste of electricity . like we should try to discourage people from standby . it's too much of a big issue for here . there's audio functions . think there's quite a lot of like dolby surround studio , surround things . think they've got their own controls in this like hidden panel .

ES2014b.D,"we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . and how do people use it ? we asked them which buttons were useful for them . and we did that by giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a even higher proportion would spend more for a fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the setting buttons for the picture and brightness and the audio settings , they weren't used very often people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control . and young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people weren't quite keen on speech recognition . there's a lot more th there's a lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . and the second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sleek good looking high tech and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should concentrate on the channels and power , and also volume and that thing , as louisa said . we could come up with a menu , a an l_c_d_ menu for other functions on the remote control . and we could think about speech recognition as because young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy our new product if we aim it at high tech design . and we could think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than having it to speech recognition to change the channels . there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . about speech recognition ? we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as would it take quite a while to develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? clapping , clapping , nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a second or two to press another number , we could possibly put an l_ a l_c_d_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that we're talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , we need to keep the tuning function in . the detailed ones would be brightness , and probably a power one as the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , numbers is ten , volume is twelve , and a mute , you've got brightness and contrast . and then an enter button for saying that you want that particular thing tuned in .

ES2014c.A,"right from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we had . right we had the fact that we're gonna have the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , a front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page that it could meet the technical requirements . what would be the cost do we know ? are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . if we wanted to know that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time the scroll wheel required the regular , the display requires an advanced chip if we go for the simple push button , effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? w kinetic . are we going for speech recognition ? and we would want it in as an extra we're to go for the international market rather than a local market the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications . you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features you'd have model one , model two and model three , but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . alright , we're just gonna have the rubber buttons , you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , th that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . if y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . rubber buttons require rubber case . the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . you're just changing one aspect like the standby button like that , you could have your company badge and logo . lot of computers like on the one you've got there , it actually has a stick on badge one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .

ES2014c.B,"we all have a presentation again , for the components design , next step is the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . then there is a chip and still the sender . yes including the power s supply as first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , there's a dynamo . there's a kinetic option , which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . but that was gonna cost a little more . and then there's solar cells . as a final option . for the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is just the same as the standard ones . this says it's similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like like modern computer . there's a scroll wheel which is the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , i th the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . the firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board . if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there's a small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , going to my personal preferences , thought possibly for power we could use kinetic and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . for the buttons , we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we'd have to get a more costly circuit board . if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . i'm guessing . but i don't know , that is something i'll have to look into . that's a decision for all of us . as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . and note that the push button just requires a simple chip , just a simple push button , did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? it is the concept we discussed before . but then we don't know for whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . we'd have a simple circuit board we'd stick with the simple circuit board just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . it's just an addition thing but we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . the children's remote should be like a next step , we could have volume written on the side it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . to something which is more universal . the spongy feel is something we could think about , still with a rubber design we could i suppose we are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . and whether we'd have a big enough market to have this like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . it seems to make sense that we'd just stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine . we'll go for single curve , did we decide on the kinetic power supply ?

ES2014c.C,"that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . and if we're going for sleek and sexy , scroll wheel is bit kinda bulky ? a simple pushbuttons . but the way that i interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . don't think it would effect our circuit board . and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . very brief presentation , from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy . haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there's some curved cases that you can see , range of sizes all of them have a lot of buttons there some of the remotes that i looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions . and it was quite swish model , it's better not to try and compete with that thing the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great . th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , there was children's remote , where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you could program them that they could only look at certain channels . because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function . there was a mention just as warning about button design . just to avoid ambiguity . think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say this triangular button is pointing up , they might see they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , the function is to turn the button up . be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be two contradicting shapes . if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . that could be a little apple . but i suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as as buttons . but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , aren't we ? if we just went for one colour of a rubber case shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? and the rubber push buttons , rubber case . and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . without affecting the circuit board . we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , most of them will just be mainly circular or like very plain . just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .

ES2014c.D,"i suppose we need to find out what circuit board that requires , before we m make a decision . just for the call and find thing . i've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . right , i've been looking at some trends in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market that we'd asked people about remote controls and what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . and we've also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . we've had people in paris and milan watching the fashion trends . the most important thing was that the thing look and felt fancy rather than just functional . and second , there should be some technological innovation . and then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as and the fashion trends are that people want clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . but the feel of the material should be spongy , we need to emphasise the fancy design with on our remote control above all else . and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our find the thing with a hand clap . and then find a way to incorporate these trends that we capture people's imaginations . we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the buttons could be spongy , somehow . and then even wackier than that , we could have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , how far we actually want to go along and follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or do they not matter that much ? i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , and then are we going for one button shaped like a fruit . or veg . could be a red apple , ","The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size.

ES2014d.A,"and when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the the red apple button . but there would be a cost implication on that , and the bit after the evaluation criteria is is the finance . and the cost implication . and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to to manufacture . right , as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half euros . by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . we've got a rubber case materials supplements . w the button supplements . originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . we've got one special button form , which was the apple . we've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , i was originally , i was thinking rubber wasn't special , you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . that gives us twelve point seven that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? the other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , i would go for a one on that at this point in time . incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . i woulda said two would seem reasonable . the product is a recognisable real r reaction product ? two . we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . if you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you've got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item . we're going for plastic , yes ? you got special colour . originally i was assuming we had the red apple , we've got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . our plan really was to have one button only with a special special colour , you want three in there . and we've got special form is the one apple . you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , you'd put fash fan fashion at three rather than two . you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple . next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon . we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? and the speech feature . but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick on badge . long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product . in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour . we're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the on the other opt on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of having as a different colour ?  we've done the finance bit and the excel project and the we've done the redesign . we're now on to project process . now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves enough ? the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that . then you go away .

They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls. They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors, materials, and shapes.

IS1009b.B,"as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice . and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel that the ch children cannot view that channel . one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v_ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t_ in alphabet for more compactability . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that .

IS1009b.D,"thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . i'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . because if we're gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . it's gotta be really attractive and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or lamp . alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , we talked about the a light emitting thing as as beep , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and then motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that's already been eliminated by management , we're off the hook . you say that won't add too much to the budget ? do you think there's any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but several different shapes ? because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something because there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . having buttons be various shapes might be a help too . like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , that people can develop a tactile sense of it . if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has lot of marketing pull . can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but ","The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly, telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house.

IS1009c.C,"this time i'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it should be strong . and it should be recyclable . like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , we have to use some colouring compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , this is a normal remote controller . like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , you can see the t_a_ double one eight three five labelled chip you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are resistors , actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it's a l inexpensive . but a b a push button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and k full a complete chip . and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , kinetic provision of energy , or we can use solar sells . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , no , no , th the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , now , nobody uses that because you need a k sophisticated chip and all . think it's better we go for ordinary buttons . but i what i'm very much doubtful how far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it has its own problems , issues . to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , ","The group comments on her presentation, and then the industrial designer begins presenting.

there are some notes in it already i see , some documents . i don't know if you've noticed , but we're working for real reaction . we put fashion in electronics , we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . this is our agenda . we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . then take some notes you can take the minutes once in a while . but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down . have you all seen the corporate website already ? have you seen any flaws in it ? found one . but on the corporate information side there's a th there was real remote instead of real reaction . our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . project method is there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design . the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation . but that will be all worked out in other meetings . as you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . you can save . these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little piece of drawing . a blank new document for each person . select a pen , eraser . then we've got our pen . this pen . it's really funny you can also select the current colour and the line width . and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there . we've got our shared folder , but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . here is a simple tool bar . it's save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we're going to try out the white board . we're going to draw animal . and just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . you can use this pen by holding it like a little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked another thing is you have to be bit slow . if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up . we choose form of current colour think grey is appropriate . now you'll see my drawing capabilities . you have to do it real slow . i was trying to draw a dolphin , and then you can undo you have to hold it a bit upside down . now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . it's easier to draw the smaller line width , it's pretty skinny cat . everybody knows how to work with the white board now ?

like you can use for other ? i've got one at home . and you can program eight different devices in it , and it also operates on infra red , you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as we've we want different functions and we can see if we can do something with the infra red . will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder . then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and we can all work on our own projects . then i'll meet you in about a half an hour , ",The project manager introduced himself to the team and then acquainted the team with the audio and video equipment in the meeting room.

TS3003b.A,"now we're going into the functional design . then our agenda . first the opening . this time i will take the minutes . you're going to have a presentation . all of you . and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . i'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v_ . that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be thing of the past . another one is the customer is forty plus . that's the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . i suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . standard remote . we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it's the biggest share of the whole population now . but don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the device i've looked for although i didn't realise it . think teletext can be can be a function as but only if if it won't higher the cost , is anybody really against teletext ? that's a good idea as especially for the subtitles . that's very important we have a few buttons . but do you need the buttons for one to zero . we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or it's very important in the design . you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?  we should implement the audio sign , another point is the l_c_d_ screen . don't know if that will rise the cost too much , just the l_c_d_ . that's a good idea . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , l_c_d_ . general functions and default materials . that's a good idea as because what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , if we want with the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people . now you're talking about sixty to eighty in different languages , what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend watching .

TS3003b.D,"my name is freek van ponnen . i'm the market expert . we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out a questionnaire . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control . in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . then there are some one time use function . that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what this indicates for our design . we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s_ r_s_i_ . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . we should make very few buttons . think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . you'd know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an l_c_d_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider . it would certainly make a fancy design . you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature but if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but if i s if i see this , it's we're just gonna go for another it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . think if you're gonna include teletext you do . but don't think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and you would need like the t_v_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . but i don't think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v_ , you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . mean we need a good way to position all the buttons but i don't think we should spend very much time in that . fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . and it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , if we're able to really bring an innovative product . but i'd have to look into that a little more . and with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could we n it would be a lot easier to adapt it to different cultures .

TS3003d.D,"is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . since it rechargeable . d i assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , i was thinking , you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . only the docking station , it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . that would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also . integrated scroll wheel push button . but then again that would be d j just not an option for older people , who don't even scroll wheel is . holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . and a scroll wheel . i still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me . but since we just have to . i'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote . yes . definitely . this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . if older people like familiar forms and familiar this is not familiar for them . i did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . innovative ? what new functions are there ? easy to use ? learnability is a very important factor here . is it functional ? and the cost . the target group . is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? we all go for six ? is the design innovative ?  seven ? is the design easy to use ? do we have too many functions ? and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i_ influences ? think we do . are the production costs within the preset limits ? they are now . does the design fit the group of focus ? i'd go for two . is the company recognisable ? we have the logo there . i was also supposed to calculate the score , these are seven factors times seven is forty something . two ? forty one out of forty nine . think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase . not too much . no . and i would've liked to go for the younger users also . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . pen is here . if we're n gonna make a scroll button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . we should just re focus . then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers . are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? ","Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information. One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros. The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button. All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype. To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel. It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3). The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product. The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage. Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints. A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval. "

TS3007b.A,"welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . and will put the minutes that i have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , had an email from the management board but there were four points which think are very important . first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated second one is also important the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , it not gonna it's not gonna be a multi purpose remote control , second , and that's important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach group younger than forty . to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . think not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want . but it's strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . that's a idea . you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . but that's we wel later in the stage . because elderly people may be not used to touch screen , they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be on the touch screen , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are are done . each time i had a summary on what you told and what you personal think . th the main points in this in this meeting is how it's going to look we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . and it's not too complex to do it . we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it's back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . will put my minutes they're updated in the shared folder too . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the email . you all have the questionnaire again about the after work .

TS3007b.B,"i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , if you going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make , but also the user friendliness , and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , use as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . and one of the ideas was use touch screen , but s i don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote cannot receive anything , but we might consider that . just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . i prefer to use it only for t_v_ and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select and that's where the difficulties lie . do we want to use a few options and might not be or original , or multi purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . do we want to use menu display on the t_v_ ? or does have to f everything be in remotes ? if you use a memory display on the t_v_ , you can simply push more menu and then select the options you want to have and press if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v_ and don't use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind little little thing or a touch screen . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . we should just ease down on the functionality to to keep it accessible make a remote that fits easily in the hands you you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , then i'd like to make a proposal . if you make one big touch screen , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . that they always make the same buttons accessible , use just for special options a part of the touch screen . an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v_ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . is that possible to use or no ? you can display actual buttons on the touch screens . then there's always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v_ it is , there are universal d remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , in codes , y you get a b a book with codes . if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , then you have to buy a new one , or an update , software update . for which one are we going ? i was doubting about which one to take , but you've convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .

TS3007b.C,"when you mentioned improving functions , what what do by that focusing more on the used buttons . could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function i'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project . what i did was i dissected current remote controls and viewed how they w looked , what components are involved , and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i'll show it to you in a few seconds . and i'll explain a bit about how it works what i did was checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v_ or stereo and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , if we want to build remote control with bluetooth then the t_v_ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , that would mean extra cost for the user that's probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have very simple structure , we should be able to build a relatively cheap cheap remote . because my personal opinion is is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , i actually i figured that would be rather but then you'd still have the the infrared function . but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep beep something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . i'll just explain a bit of the components . the energy source would be a battery , simple battery i figured that would be best , the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch when a button is prush pushed in , electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that's that's the h user won't be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control . my personal opinion is no receiver we should look into the design and the functionability . like i said , use one button for m multiple functions , just hide the few buttons o of switching it open the usual we shouldn't make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . you have to keep in mind that not all not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up the extra functions . wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub menus , with or sub items , sub functions . that actually depends on the television , thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , but we have to look at what's our target audience . w we are aiming for younger people they they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v_ and that is bit of a tricky job . or you could you could s actually look at the place holder you talked about earlier , then it's be back to the building a receiving if it's actually worth it to build it in , it would be bringing more costs with it my vote goes out to the right .

TS3007b.D,"i have some new findings on marketing expert level , the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . two audiences , the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience is thirty five percent . it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology like an l_c_d_ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . i don't think that's really appropriate . and when you see the audience , the age is going up they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . switching channels , the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . but at the moment teletext is th the best thing you can get on t_v_ , like getting information . they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . my personal preferences . we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . first of all it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from i from it . we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . people used to get lost off the remote controller , it's an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v_ but it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used on a remote control . you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , it's but the most used buttons have to be bigger or perhaps . what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place holder next to the t_v_ , connected to the t_v_ ? current t_v_s can even send infrared . it's an option if you use an l_c_d_ or a touch screen that in the middle are the main keys , just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down . and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t_v_ . the idea about touch screen is very good . because recently saw news item on t_v_ about new telephones for elder people . they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang up , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? i had another idea about parental control . like building in some pin code if children don't know the pin code , they can't switch to violent channels or th those things are but if you display it on l_c_d_ screen with r really big numbers and th those young people , y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi media applications . i th we can do that too . with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press you have to press a code for t_v_ . but , on the other hand on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new t_v_ that isn't incorporated in the remote we can incorporate some u_s_b_ or a firewire connection , that you can connect it to the p_c_ and also like a clapping li like device that pops open .

TS3007c.C,"i'll be talking about the components . what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two different age groups . below forty five and above . senior citizens they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . and they like straightforward shapes . where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . soft and fluffy and colourful and but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . or you can go for both ? but about solar panel is you have to have l light . and you could use normal light , but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery i prefer kinetic because it's the costs aren't that much higher , and ju just a bit more high tech than a normal battery . but , what l what jarek said , you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . or but you could go in a in an double curves . and that's like several different dimensions . that gives you a younger and more high tech look , i f i figured . you could y it leaves more space for creativity . i ch prefer rubber because it feels we discussed it in a previous meeting , figured i'll just leave it at the l_c_d_ . you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? i prefer rubber . i don't know if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . i if we in incorporate the parental control , let's say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v_ and presses up what m what may be better is to incorporate an separate device that that you can program with the remote control . i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with receiver in it . but you still have the problem about the television itself . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . if you have the l l_c_d_ screen , you can have a small logo i at the bottom .

TS3007c.D,"but if you have a square l_c_d_ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the l_c_d_ screen . that's it's custom customisable and i went to paris and milan for some trend watching . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , that's people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . they like spongy material , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . materials like wood that they have to look fancy . they should be technological in innovative . and easy to use . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and therefore use fresh colours . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . and third , i stick with it , the log in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . how i see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a windows log on screen with parents , children . like f voice recognition is too much , but it's handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . that spins around like all the time . it's just like a globe in internet explorer . ","The industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source, materials and components. The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material. He explained that the remote should look fancy, and be technologically innovative and easy to use. He suggested using removable customisable covers, speech recognition, installing some games into the remote, and implementing a parental control feature. The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition.

TS3007d.A,"once again i'm gonna take minutes . first we have a prototype presentation by g_ and g_ . evaluation crit criteria . in combination with the finance i received an an excel file which we have to fill in later on . and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . and after that , an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all all this . once again , forty minutes , i would g give the word to g_ and g_ for the prototype presentation . but you d you mustn't forget that our target aim is younger people . think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard , and for the people who really want more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay that . but , the mai th the standard must be some attractive flashy colours . not too , but w a little , teletext is in the menu . volume is true . we p we can do it glow in the dark . w according to the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v_ room , this one will stand out , if this lying on your couch , you're you think what's that for kinda orange thing . but not too soft we have decided . three , easy to use . one . two . two . but they are built in , it's one . we have now to c to calculate the production cost . if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . it's only once double curved . we're now in a problem , we have reached eleven euro yet . but we want to make the wood colours , that the kinetic thing , can we just skip it , because you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . but it's its' it's r it is the main point of the look . if we do this , we're on twelve and a half euro . because if you want to go to kinetic , you're you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and now it's more of compromise we were above , we did a little redesign now it's about time to talk about this project . was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? how about the leadership ? i was a i was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the and think the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk teamwork ? and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . but , really teamwork were you two be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , the idea of the touch screen is i don't you had expected it to be more but not the predefined squares there the functionality is there , but it's not ideal , it costs a lot of time to the costs are within the budget . the project is evaluated . because there must be some end report . about all the meetings , what we have decided , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is we can do it together . s i will put it on a story board . this is about the functional design , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . then the conceptual design . he here it is still double curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . nay but that this is what and the added functions like tetris snake , anybody misses something here about that's what i'm gonna write b between now . gonna redesign something now . finish meeting now . i'm going to finish my end report . ","The project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda. The user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design, describing the shape and layout of the remote. The group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours, but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product. The group calculated the production costs. The group were 4 euros over budget, so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy. The project manager led the evaluation of the project process. It was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings. The group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team. The group were also had problems with the digital pens. The group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting. "
TS3007d.B,"shall i give a short introduction and then this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch screen . and we began with with a form of shape , that is is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , but the overlaying layer is little bit curved and you have room here for your battery s and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip . it would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , i'll buy for a couple of euros some noi hip think a cover is necessary , there must be some cheap standard cover , a wood style , a white c and couple of h hip fruity colours . and lea delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too much .  when we put in fancy colours , it'll make a difference . if your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , that's stupid . most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . would call choose two , we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not . it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . but make it two , because the games are in a sub menu and not it's not an entire game . battery , yes . one . kinetic , one . special is the special colour ? if you're honest , we'll type one , special colour . single curves . but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it's just one curve and not a back curved or no advanced chip , that's a little bit of problem . there's an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . more consensus . we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . d just write your name right now . he knows how it works , the idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . i it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow . and the eraser was another problem . m abo what new ideas ? new ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or people will still feel the need to write it quickly on page and not download it and save it , and more user friendly . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . and writing text you've gotta really do your best to write some to use , it's a read only version . you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . the end conclusion . before you change anything you save it first .
